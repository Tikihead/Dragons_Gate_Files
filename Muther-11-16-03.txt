[Town Square South.]

The outward appearance of the people here seems a bit classier. Rich clothing and large coin purses are prevalent amongst the travelers. In fact, many of the folk heading into Town Square from the south are accompanied by large bodyguards to assure their safety. The well maintained road is lined with small brass lanterns, each swinging off an individual pole. No expense has been spared to keep those who travel this road safe from the hoodlums that relish the darkness.  A street lantern is here.

This area is illuminated.
You see the 1st battle cat (wearing a small gold collar), the 1st raccoon (wearing a small gold collar), and the 1st black cat (wearing a small gold collar).
In the area are Dogear the Noble Leuian, Tiruna the Noble Leuian, Audun the Noble Leuian, Hott the Noble Leuian, Ripley the Leuian, Zahra the Noble Leuian, Meir the Leuian, and Clawntaka the Leuian.

[Town Square West.]

People carrying bundles stream in from the west and rapidly lose themselves in the large crowds moving about in the vast town square. Several citizens head west with bulging coinpurses babbling excitedly about what they're going to purchase. Giggling children dart around the slower moving folks rushing on their way to spend the silvers in their pockets.  A street lantern is here.

[Town Square.]

Two elegant buildings, one to the north and one to the west, stand on either side of a quickly degrading road. Nattily dressed patrons of the two establishments hurry to their destination, not pausing for fear of being robbed, or worse. To the northwest the houses steadily become more decrepit. A dark pallor of smoky air hangs heavily over the area.  A street lantern and a heavy mahogany door are here.

[HOD Agent.]

You have entered the somber insurance headquarters of the House of the Dead. Richly appointed furnishings indicate that these services are refused by few. An elegant sign over a massive desk details available services. The presence of some inexplicable power sets your nerves on end. This is no place for hostility.   A wooden sign, a pitch black portal, and a pitch black portal are here.

[Trade & Bazaar.]

A path to the north winds its way among various stalls and tents. Some specialty outlets can be found, provided one does not get lost in this maze known as the Bazaar. More permanent structures to the south suggest finer goods as well as increased security.  A street lantern is here.

[Trade & Market.]

The buildings of Market Circle stand to the south. It becomes obvious that the area through the arch is a much cleaner marketplace than the bazaar. An inviting eatery stands beside the road, its door open to those weary after a long trip to Spur, as well as those preparing to venture to the great expanses beyond the west gate. A human couple exit the building, arm in arm. A small sign stands beside the intersection.  A sign, an open glossy lacquered oak door, and a street lantern are here.

[Market Circle.]

An arch between two large buildings connects Market Circle and Market Street. The more reputable shopkeepers do business within the circle, but pay higher taxes for the privilege. The buildings have been built to last, as these merchants are no traveling tinkers. Interlocking stone walkways and colorful plantings span this central area. Despite the number of animals waiting outside the bank for their owners, the area is spotless. Loud chatter in many languages can be heard from the southwest.  A marble archway, an open elegant gold-trimmed walnut door, and a wooden sign are here.

Several city guardsmen have just finished wrestling to the ground some young tough thieves, who thought to rob one of the returning merchants. To one side a relieved-looking Fir Elf gentleman holds on tightly to his gold-tipped walking stick, as the human boy yells his innocence to any who might listen. His pleas fall on deaf ears as the guards drag him away.  A street lantern is here.

Merchants, some in frilly finery, others dressed in homespun wools, travel back and forth along this street on their way to and from work. They seem to blend together here, if only briefly.

A neatly kept park fronts this portion of Merchant Walk. Topiary and low shrubberies partition off small sections of the park.

People carrying bundles stream in from the west and rapidly lose themselves in the large crowds moving about in the vast town square.

[Knowledge Path.]

Several members of the various mage orders of Spur and well-dressed shoppers seeking rarities travel along Knowledge's Path to and from the District of Magick.

Before you stands a magnificent white marble temple dedicated to Odarous, the god of chivalry. Ten giant steps made of the same gleaming marble lead up to the temple entrance. Two large statues stand at the base of the stairs, also carved of breath-taking marble. One is a warrior bearing a massive sword and a large shield. The other is a cleric with an amulet bearing the mark of Odarous in one hand and a large mace in the other.  Some gleaming white marble stairs, a polished white marble statue, a polished white marble statue, and a street lantern are here.

[Town Square.]

Commercial buildings flank Town Square to the west and south of this corner. Imposing buildings stand stiffly to your west, while those to the south have a slightly seedy look about them.  The door to the west has a freshly painted sign over it,  "Under New Management."  A closed tan weathered pine door, a large doorway, and a street lantern are here.

                        You have visualized the following locations
                        -------------------------------------------

                                    Visualization #1 is:
Through the gate lies the city of Spur, the major center of trade and civilization on the plains. The dusty road leading through the gates is well traveled, and walls of the city are in good repair. A small shack sits to the west of the road, during most times of the day a dusty coach can be seen waiting in front, its horses stomping with impatience to be gone. To the right of the door is a small window, its opening covered with metal bars. An old man, missing most of his teeth, waits patiently for the travelers to pay their fare, and then directs them into the waiting area. On the east side of the road a billowing multicolored tent has been erected, the hustle and bustle of merchants and customers can be seen coming and going at all times of the day.

                                    Visualization #2 is:
The white paving stones give way to a boardwalk made of wooden planks.  The wood doesn't appear to be of Spurian make, and looks a great deal older, but very sturdy.

                                    Visualization #3 is:
Contrasting starkly with the ashes of the forest and brush is a freshly constructed set of stairs that wraps itself about the large tree. The intricate woodwork that decorates the steps is of the finest quality, as if in parody to the blackened destruction of the hedges and brambles around the base of the trunk. Bright green leaves of clover have begun springing up through the ashy soil in conjunction with soft moss to lend a durable cushion to this well-traveled spot.

Your active visualization is #1

[Town Square.]

Commercial buildings flank Town Square to the west and south of this corner. Imposing buildings stand stiffly to your west, while those to the south have a slightly seedy look about them.

You follow Clawntaka north...

[Town Square West.]

People carrying bundles stream in from the west and rapidly lose themselves in the large crowds moving about in the vast town square. Several citizens head west with bulging coinpurses babbling excitedly about what they're going to purchase. Giggling children dart around the slower moving folks rushing on their way to spend the silvers in their pockets.  A street lantern is here.

[Merchant Walk.]

Neatly trimmed shrubbery line well-maintained cobblestones along Merchant Walk. Apprentices rush by carrying supplies and orders, carrying out their masters' business. Several wooden benches line the walk for those customers who need to rest from the strain of carrying heavy parcels.  A street lantern is here.

[Merchant Walk.]

A neatly kept park fronts this portion of Merchant Walk. Topiary and low shrubberies partition off small sections of the park. Young lovers sit on benches almost hidden from view, gazing at each other with looks of love, oblivious to the continual bustle of passing customers and merchants on their way to do business.  A street lantern is here.

[Merchant Walk.]

Merchants, some in frilly finery, others dressed in homespun wools, travel back and forth along this street on their way to and from work. They seem to blend together here, if only briefly. Several of the more haughty looking merchants are trailed by overloaded carts pushed along by haggard young apprentices.   A street lantern is here.

Several city guardsmen have just finished wrestling to the ground some young tough thieves, who thought to rob one of the returning merchants. To one side a relieved-looking Fir Elf gentleman holds on tightly to his gold-tipped walking stick, as the human boy yells his innocence to any who might listen. His pleas fall on deaf ears as the guards drag him away.  A street lantern is here.

[Merchant Walk.]

Merchant Walk comes to an abrupt end at a massive moonsilver gate. The towering walls of Spur on either side of the gates force all to pass by the guards who are constantly on the watch for thieves and bandits. Just beyond the gates one can glimpse the bustling Merchant District of Spur.  A gilded oak sign and a street lantern are here.

Clawntaka says in Leuian, "we'll just to to Rathan."

You follow Clawntaka through an open stone gate...

[Trade Way.]

A large gate separates the Merchant District and Town Square-the hub of Spur's activity. The partially opened gate is currently able to accommodate the simultaneous passage of several locals and visitors, but can be expanded to accept carriages, or sealed to ward against invasion.  Guards stand sentry from atop the wall as well as the ground.  A street lantern is here.

[Trade Way.]

Many townsfolk pass along this busy thoroughfare. Rich and poor alike mix freely on this street, much to the dismay of a passing nobleman. A young human struggles with an armful of packages and two young children in tow. Those in need of goods or supplies head west towards the market, those looking for the news of the day head east towards Town Square.  A street lantern is here.

[Trade & Bazaar.]

A path to the north winds its way among various stalls and tents. Some specialty outlets can be found, provided one does not get lost in this maze known as the Bazaar. More permanent structures to the south suggest finer goods as well as increased security.  A street lantern is here.

[Trade Way.]

This well-worn road separates the Bazaar to the north and Market Circle to the south. Only a Thugian could appreciate the layered odors of simmering foodstuffs and shoppers from the Bazaar. Crowds of people push past, some brushing against you. It might be a good idea to keep an eye on your coinpurse.  A street lantern is here.

[Trade & Market.]

The buildings of Market Circle stand to the south. It becomes obvious that the area through the arch is a much cleaner marketplace than the bazaar. An inviting eatery stands beside the road, its door open to those weary after a long trip to Spur, as well as those preparing to venture to the great expanses beyond the west gate. A human couple exit the building, arm in arm. A small sign stands beside the intersection.  A sign, an open glossy lacquered oak door, and a street lantern are here.

The throngs of travelers thicken as one heads east along Trade Way. An Anthian plays softly on a strange looking stringed instrument, her melodic voice filling the air. Judging by her clothing, and the number of silvers at her feet, she makes a fine living practicing her craft.  A street lantern is here.

Deep grey mists surround a strange pile of rubble that lies south of the road. Occasionally a priest clad in a simple grey robe will wander past the rubble and whisper a short prayer under his breath. The fence running around the rubble is well kept, but the gate which once allowed entrance to this Temple has been chained closed.  A grey iron chained gate, a pile of rubble, and a street lantern are here.

From the city gate to the west, Trade Way continues eastward towards the busy Merchant district, past Joyeusse's Shop. The air is thick with the scent of fresh flowers. Wagons filled with goods bound for sale trundle past, their drivers hopeful of the anticipated profits. Eager young warriors venture towards the west gate and the dangers beyond.  An open carved rosewood door and a street lantern are here.

[Gateway.]

The relative safety inside Spur is a comfort to those returning from the fields and mountains. To those leaving, a massive wall of defense around the city lies ahead. Archer towers beside the gate overlook the wall, offering a painful welcome to would-be invaders. Several guards on foot patrol pass and disappear behind a thick, bluesteel banded steelwood door. Wall road stretches to the south, a wide passage between the city wall and several large buildings.  An open iron gate, an open thick stone door, and a street lantern are here.

Audun twitches his tail.

[Spur Gateway.]

Travelers from Rathan to the northwest, and the Trade Route to the south, converge at Spur's west gate. Guards posted on the ground give those seeking to enter the city a cursory once-over. Their lack of interest shows that anyone approaching has already been observed from above for some time. A grate in the ground loosens mud from wagon wheels and hooves before they pass through the gate, helping to keep the streets of Spur fairly clean.  An open giant black iron gate, a giant green oak tree, a small blue pool, a thick oak grate over the pool, a broken frosted carriage, a large shattered drathain jewel chest, a dead noble guard, a dead noble guard, a crude orkish shield, and a crude orkish shield are here.

[Oak Woods.]

Oak trees surround you on every side reaching their leaves up to the sky in majestic splendor. Rising high above the rest of the oaks stands a massive tree, clearly hundreds of years older than those around it within this section of the forest. A small path curves around the base of the tree and enters what looks to be some sort of small clearing, you can see a few Elves dressed entirely in green walking within the clearing, though telling them from the forest is proving a difficult task. A small sign hangs above the path that reads, "Foresters Guild".  A giant green oak tree, a golden oak tree, a giant ancient oak tree, and a worn grassy path are here.

[West Spur Road.]

The path is flanked by countless tall oaks, swaying peacefully in the wind. They do their best to hide the sky from view, making it hard to tell night from day at times. Littering the area are pieces of broken wagon, bits of human remains and dried splotches of blood. The remnants of a violent fight lie all around you, whomever used to belong to the wagon is no more than vulture food.  A bloody severed foot is here.

[West Spur Road.]

A dark foreboding forest is visible far off to the west. No grass grows near the forest. The grasslands shrink away from the grove as if even the plant life is afraid of it. There is a barren area between where the grass ends and the trees begin, giving the forest the illusion of isolation.

Old trees lay side by side with the massive boulders of the mountain, intermingling in a terrible landslide. The mountain top has broken off and slid across the eastern road stopping all forms of transportation. It would take years for mortal hands to remove the tons of stone from the original roadway to make it passable once again. Thankfully, nature has changed the landscape for the better, and has opened a gap through the mountain to the north.

A carpet of needles covers the path. Pine cones, larger then a Thugian fist, dot the ground. Enormous trees collide with large boulders blocking you from venturing too deep into the overgrown wood. The squawk of a large bird echoes from far overhead, but looking up to identify it would be futile, as it perches in branches hundreds of feet above your head.

Only the hardiest of life forms hold their own on the rocky steppes. Small cascades of icy water stream down the boulders and darken their surfaces. Tough lichen and scrub pines absorb nutrients from the mineral laden run-off. The sun shines brightly on the southern exposure of the trail, sheltered from the wind and freezing cold. Bright green oases of life sprout from rocky niches and the path is slippery where the green slimy growths cross it.

Huge boulders have created a bowl shaped depression in this sheltered hillock. A stand of scruffy trees continues to eke out a tenuous existence above the rocky outpost; their long tortured roots clinging desperately to what little soil is caught between the boulders. Prevailing winds from the mountaintop have caused the trunks to lean westward, the upper branches creating a canopy over the area.

Beneath the trees, many a caravan has stopped to water their draft animals and rest for the night. The area is strewn with animal refuse, bits of feed, and the resulting lingering aroma. The discarded feed and rubbish left by the travelers is picked over constantly by the hillock's inhabitants. In such a harsh environment, very little waste is left by the local scavengers.

A small spring fed stream meanders around the bowl, filling a pool on the western side of the path. A series of miniature waterfalls gurgle delightfully along the edges of the camp. The resulting pool is quite deep and crystal clear, even with the constant watering of pack animals. The flow of the spring must be constantly replenishing the pool, for no algae or slime clouds its depths.  A small crystal clear pool is here.

The boulders bear scars from deeply driven pinions and screws used to hold cables and reins, or perhaps impromptu corrals for the portage animals.

A lean-to built from odds and ends serves as a way station for exhausted travelers. Gathered firewood lines the lean-to's walls, and a small darkened pit smolders outside the opening. Inside the small, cramped lean-to, light filters in through the makeshift construction. The possibility of being snowed in and sheltering for a long period in this little hovel is not a welcome proposition.

An incredibly large keep looms ominously above the perfectly groomed grounds, its windows dark. The gate is carved with strange, deeply etched symbols that seem to swirl and writhe. There is no sign of life, no guard, not even a lowly footman to receive visitors...only more interminable silence.  An open old black obsidian gate, a two-handed long-spear, a cotton tunic, a closed flowery embroidered silk beltpouch, a straw hat, a dirty handkerchief, a silver corkscrew, a tiny blue and white porcelain teacup, a coral ring of Unknown, and a small smooth obsidian bead are here.

An open old black obsidian gate, a two-handed long-spear, a cotton tunic, a closed flowery embroidered silk beltpouch, a straw hat, a dirty handkerchief, a silver corkscrew, a tiny blue and white porcelain teacup, a coral ring of Unknown, and a small smooth obsidian bead are here.

The plain hallway comes to an abrupt halt at a rather imposing cobblestone wall. The curvature of its face and the age of the stones date it to well before the building of this small hallway. Set within the cobblestones is a large door, that blends so well it is hardly discernible to the naked eye.  An open large cobblestone door is here.

This area is not illuminated.
You see the 1st battle cat (wearing a small gold collar), the 1st raccoon (wearing a small gold collar), and the 1st black cat (wearing a small gold collar).

The putrid odors of sweat, urine, and blood confront your sense of smell, threatening to overwhelm it, and each of your other senses. Cedar heartwood planks comprise the floor of the tower. Time and moisture have caused the wood to warp and crack, making your passage somewhat hazardous.  A cold spiraling stone staircase and an open large cobblestone door are here.

The charred remains of a cherry wood cabinet stand in the dim light. Multicolored shards of glass line the doors and litter the base of the wooden display case.

Small knobs adorn the wall on either side of the circular staircase. Upon further inspection, these knobs are actually small ebony hands, palms up and fingers slightly curved into a grasping position. The minute appendages line the walls high and low, some still holding long iron pokers and malleable steel paddles, others serving as hooks for three-pronged barbed whips.  A cold spiraling stone staircase, an iron chainmail coif, and a short hatchet are here.

A green veined marble chair occupies the center position in this portion of the tower. The armrests contain thick leather straps, obviously designed for holding the occupant of the chair in place securely, and sharp spikes where the wrists would rest. Similar restraints are found where the legs would be, and a larger leather binding hangs where a head would be positioned. Directly under the armrests hang rusted copper buckets.  A cold spiraling stone staircase, a tiny blue and white porcelain saucer, and an open tattered burlap pouch are here.

Concentric circles of fire-blackened stone form an eerie pattern on the floor beneath a suspended platform. The platform, hanging haphazardly by pulleys from only two of its four corners, is crafted from loose sheets of ring mail. Each ring is large enough to allow your finger to pass through, as well as the searing heat of the fire. The ring mail still holds strands of hair and rotting scales.

Concentric circles of fire-blackened stone form an eerie pattern on the floor beneath a suspended platform. The platform, hanging haphazardly by pulleys from only two of its four corners, is crafted from loose sheets of ring mail. Each ring is large enough to allow your finger to pass through, as well as the searing heat of the fire. The ring mail still holds strands of hair and rotting scales.  A cold stone staircase, a porcelain jug, a pair of bearskin pants, a small carved wooden cup, a short bronze dagger, a short iron frying pan, an oak leaf, and a black cloth eyepatch are here.

Similar restraints are found where the legs would be, and a larger leather binding hangs where a head would be positioned. Directly under the armrests hang rusted copper buckets.  A cold spiraling stone staircase, a tiny blue and white porcelain saucer, and an open tattered burlap pouch are here.

Small knobs adorn the wall on either side of the circular staircase. Upon further inspection, these knobs are actually small ebony hands, palms up and fingers slightly curved into a grasping position. The minute appendages line the walls high and low, some still holding long iron pokers and malleable steel paddles, others serving as hooks for three-pronged barbed whips.  A cold spiraling stone staircase, an iron chainmail coif, and a short hatchet are here.

Concentric circles of fire-blackened stone form an eerie pattern on the floor beneath a suspended platform. The platform, hanging haphazardly by pulleys from only two of its four corners, is crafted from loose sheets of ring mail.

Bluesteel beams form the infrastructure of the conical roof in this top floor prison room. The criss-crossing network of beams high above serves as the anchor point for a dozen swaying manacle chains. Unlike the rest of the tower, the inward sloped floor in the prison is comprised of uneven cobblestone. A large grate sits like a waiting maw in the center of the floor, ready to consume any fluid that comes its way.   A cold stone staircase is here.

Stepping inside one of the cramped cells offers a perspective few wish to retain. Black iron manacles, hanging from chains imbedded in the walls, clank against each other hauntingly. The heavy, metallic smell of blood permeates the cell. Any view that might had been offered by the window has been squelched by the boards nailed over it.   A large simple red jade charm, a piece of flint, some weathered black bearskin furs, a simple gold necklace, a flower, a simple gold necklace, and a wooden torch are here.

Concentric circles of fire-blackened stone form an eerie pattern on the floor beneath a suspended platform. The platform, hanging haphazardly by pulleys from only two of its four corners, is crafted from loose sheets of ring mail.

Entering the foyer the first thing you notice is its subtle opulence. The floor is highly polished black marble, the walls are covered with a gold stripped, cream colored paper. Light filters in through a large paned glass window which, at one time must have glistened, but is now coated with the accumulation of years of dirt. A finely crafted staircase, its balustrade polished from many years of use, rises to the second floor unsupported.  A polished oak circular staircase and some open massive black obsidian double doors are here.

A lavish garden stretches between a rocky cliff to the west and a dark keep to the east.

The path widens and follows a small curve into the valley. Rainwater has pooled along the side of a large boulder. Small animals and insects are drawn to it but suddenly dart away at any sudden noise.

The stark terrain is impressive in its scope and austerity. One cannot help but feel insignificant and temporary amid the expanse of granite and limestone formed through the millennia. Washed by rain, scorched by the sun and frozen by storms, the rocks endure, a testament to the strength of the Great Divide.

The pitch of the path is precarious for carts and wheeled vehicles. The splintered wood from unfortunate wheels and spokes gathers in the cracks and crags by the side of the path. Brightly colored bits of metal and smashed pieces of iron plating stand out in contrast against the sparkling granite.

Only the hardiest of life forms hold their own on the rocky steppes. Small cascades of icy water stream down the boulders and darken their surfaces. Tough lichen and scrub pines absorb nutrients from the mineral laden run-off. The sun shines brightly on the southern exposure of the trail, sheltered from the wind and freezing cold. Bright green oases of life sprout from rocky niches and the path is slippery where the green slimy growths cross it.

A carpet of needles covers the path. Pine cones, larger then a Thugian fist, dot the ground. Enormous trees collide with large boulders blocking you from venturing too deep into the overgrown wood. The squawk of a large bird echoes from far overhead, but looking up to identify it would be futile, as it perches in branches hundreds of feet above your head.

A makeshift path has been created to circumvent the large tree that has fallen down and blocked the regular path. Lying on its side, the log stands two heads higher then the tallest Thugian.

A small birds nest has been built within one of the larger cracks of the great tree.

The trail winds around the large fallen tree. Smaller saplings, and fungus grows in the soil that is being enriched by the decaying tree.

A strong breeze blows off the mountains of the Great Divide. It both slows your climb and encourages your decent into the valley.

A wide rocky trail heads off into the mountainous terrain in an easterly direction. A large pile of rocks from an old landslide partially blocks passage in the other direction. Cracks and crevasses mar trail's surface, as runoff from the mountain snow makes its way to lower ground.

Rough granite walls rise above you to the east and west. The area here is a bit rougher and seems to have been recently mined. Large veins of silver can be seen.
