>[Under the Caersech.]

A pale red sarcophagus of clay lies centered upon the soft algae that is the floor of this cavern, its surface cracked with age, but otherwise untouched. Its intricate etchings have faded somewhat, but the discernable image of a unicorn is still quite clearly visible upon its lid. It is a wonder that the lid has not been pried open at the hands of crypt thieves -- perhaps the archaic symbols etched on each of the lid's corners have something to do with that?

This area is illuminated.
You see the 1st charred skeleton, the 1st decaying fir elf zombie, the 2nd charred skeleton, the 3rd charred skeleton, the 2nd decaying fir elf zombie, the 3rd decaying fir elf zombie, and the 4th decaying fir elf zombie.
Obvious paths: north* south*.

A pale red sarcophagus of clay lies centered upon the soft algae that is the floor of this cavern, its surface cracked with age, but otherwise untouched. Its intricate etchings have faded somewhat, but the discernable image of a unicorn is still quite clearly visible upon its lid. It is a wonder that the lid has not been pried open at the hands of crypt thieves -- perhaps the archaic symbols etched on each of the lid's corners have something to do with that?

This area is illuminated.
You see the 1st charred skeleton, the 1st decaying fir elf zombie, the 2nd charred skeleton, the 3rd charred skeleton, the 2nd decaying fir elf zombie, the 3rd decaying fir elf zombie, the 4th decaying fir elf zombie, the 4th charred skeleton, and the 5th charred skeleton.

[Under the Caersech.]

A pale red sarcophagus of clay lies centered upon the soft algae that is the floor of this cavern, its surface cracked with age, but otherwise untouched. Its intricate etchings have faded somewhat, but the discernable image of a unicorn is still quite clearly visible upon its lid. It is a wonder that the lid has not been pried open at the hands of crypt thieves -- perhaps the archaic symbols etched on each of the lid's corners have something to do with that?

This area is illuminated.

[Under the Caersech.]

A pale red sarcophagus of clay lies centered upon the soft algae that is the floor of this cavern, its surface cracked with age, but otherwise untouched. Its intricate etchings have faded somewhat, but the discernable image of a unicorn is still quite clearly visible upon its lid. It is a wonder that the lid has not been pried open at the hands of crypt thieves -- perhaps the archaic symbols etched on each of the lid's corners have something to do with that?

This area is illuminated.

[Under the Caersech.]

A pale red sarcophagus of clay lies centered upon the soft algae that is the floor of this cavern, its surface cracked with age, but otherwise untouched. Its intricate etchings have faded somewhat, but the discernable image of a unicorn is still quite clearly visible upon its lid. It is a wonder that the lid has not been pried open at the hands of crypt thieves -- perhaps the archaic symbols etched on each of the lid's corners have something to do with that?

This area is not illuminated.

A pale red sarcophagus of clay lies centered upon the soft algae that is the floor of this cavern, its surface cracked with age, but otherwise untouched. Its intricate etchings have faded somewhat, but the discernable image of a unicorn is still quite clearly visible upon its lid. It is a wonder that the lid has not been pried open at the hands of crypt thieves -- perhaps the archaic symbols etched on each of the lid's corners have something to do with that?

The ceiling slopes upward and the cavern opens up considerably, allowing more room to breathe and move around than in the other chambers. Resting upon the center of the algae-laden floor is a sarcophagus that has been heavily decorated and seemingly enshrined. Stone columns to either side of the huge marble coffin have been etched to depict the scene of a peaceful harvest. For some reason, it doesn't seem that the peacefulness expressed in the columns has made its way into this darkened crypt.  A closed ivy etched marble sarcophagus and a pair of spiraling sculpted stone columns are here.

A cracked mosaic of colored tiles decorates the western wall of this cavern; thick moss threatening to overcome its stark, haunting beauty. The mosiac itself depicts a scene of Firian mourners gathered within a felled city, the bodies of their brethren piled amongst the scorched landscape. A tarnished bronze plaque has been set in the lower right corner of the mosaic, etched in an ancient Firian dialect. A bitter breeze blows in from the south, and it brings with it the faint sound of a child's cry.  A tarnished bronze plaque is here.

Several simple iron sconces line the moss covered walls of this narrow passageway, long since snuffed out. Portruding slightly from the smooth rock on either side of the chamber are several rows of stone slabs, each labeled in etchings that time has rendered indescernible. At the northeastern end of the chamber, a slab is missing, leaving a deep, square hole in the cavern wall. A slight chilled breeze whisps its way about the chamber and lingers near the exposed indention.  A deep square hole in the wall is here.

The spongy, algae-covered bottom of this dank chamber houses several species of strange fungi, filling the air with an overpowering, moldy stench. Thick mosses have wound their way up the smooth rock walls, leaving very few areas where the stone remains uncovered. Upon the exposed spots of the rock walls, faded etched patterns of knotwork designs lie, signifying that while the cavern itself may be a natural work of Nature, someone has been here before and put it to use.  A mossy opening is here.

The carcass of the Druid's hut glows a deep red from the fire that consumed it. The small glade is littered with bodies of lupines and orks. Smoke snakes up from the ash, flowing through the hole in the forest room. The trees stand in silence, untouched by the flames.

The path of four leaf clove shaped flagstones leads past a small clean shack and into a well formed tunnel through the thorn bushes to the east and the Caersech to the west. The small shack is set back from the road, its walls built of a whitewashed birch. A sturdy corral, filled with well-fed horses, stands to the left of the shack. A matched pair of dapple grays stand in front of the shack waiting to take their human baggage to their destination. To the left of the door, behind a small paned window, a beautiful Fir Elf female takes coin and in return, with a charming smile, directs those who have paid their fare into the waiting room.  A small shack, a freshly painted sign, a notice of non-refund, and a small winding stone pathway are here.

Carefully winding its way up the base of the tree, and wrapping itself around the stairs, a flowering jasmine vine grows tall and lush. Dark scars from a past fire are almost hidden under tufts of fresh growth and moss. A large gap, nearly sixteen feet in distance, rests between the base of a set of stairs and the forest floor. A long moonsilver cord hangs down the side of the tree. If one pulls it, the long Elven rope will descend from above, allowing them to enter the great city of Treehaven. Bright green leaves of clover have begun springing up through the ashy soil in conjunction with soft moss to lend a durable cushion to this well-traveled spot.  Some vine-covered steps circling the tree, a freshly painted wooden sign, a healthy green patch of clover, a flowing marble fountain, some clover shaped stones, some sweet scented flowering jasmine vines, and a long woven moonsilver cord are here.

The latticework surrounding and covering the spiral staircase is finely crafted. The intertwining beams seem to weave a delicate pattern above you, accenting the view of the forest floor. Soft, new, growth can be seen all over the forest below. A small mound of moss has slowly begun to cover the old inn, creating a fuzzy green mound. A large pile of Elven rope sits near the silent Golem. This creature of Elindale helps defend the city by retrieving the rope that people have pushed down to the forest below.  Some steps circling the tree, a freshly carved wooden sign, and an Elven rope are here.

[Gaspar's Grog and Grub.]

Four sturdy walls and a roof of woven branches enclose this small tavern. From the forest floor, winding their way around the trunk of the Mother Tree, a set of intricately railed steps serve as the entrance and exit of the town of Treehaven. Strangers arriving at the top of the steps find themselves under the watchful eye of patrons seated at tables positioned about the light, airy room. A set of oak steps lead up to the new Council chambers.  An ivory inlaid pine bar, a wooden stool, a long weathered wooden bench, a long musty wooden table, some steps circling the tree, some freshly crafted oak steps, an open door, a paper covered posting board, a gilt framed painting on the wall, and an open large straw basket are here.

The branches of this tree have begun to grow through the wooden platform. The limbs have begun to twist and turn, forming their own natural base. Soft leaves create a cushion and boast several small buds. The empty remains of an abandoned building is just barely visible between the branches, buried in vines and moss. Intricately crafted stairs lead from the platform to the building that resides in the upper branches.  An open door, some finely crafted wooden stairs, and a painted wooden sign are here.

The smell of freshly cut lumber fills the large lobby of the newly finished bank.  The roof is a collage of intertwined branches and their leaves from above, with a delicately crafted wooden lattice frame set with glass panels just beneath.  The trunk of the Mother tree serves as the back wall of the bank, with the tellers sitting at booths just in front of it.  Some finely crafted wooden stairs are here.

Leaves and small twigs spot the walkway as it hugs against the trunk of the Mother Tree. New sprouts from the branches above hang softly over the wooden planks, shading it slightly. A large building rests gently against the trunk in the limbs above, nestled as though it grew from within the tree itself.  An oak ladder is here.

Firm wooden planks fit snuggly to create the walkway that extends proudly upon the reconstructed supports. The view of the forest to the northwest is quite panoramic. A staircase here seems to have some enchantment, judging by the strange appearance of unicorns, bears and owls on the lower steps. Strange, due to the fact that they don't appear carved, painted, or placed by any hand-made means. It is as if the glyphs grew into the wood itself. Mysterious symbols are scattered throughout the portraits, which shimmer with a golden whisper as they are approached.

This is the main entrance of a Temple of Elindale, the inside walls perfectly smooth with glowing magickal symbols upon the surfaces. The enormity of this tree becomes apparent as one travels up the stairs to the northwest. The air holds a fresh, new ambiance, pleasantly scented with sweet sap and rich, earthly undertones.  Some glowing magickal symbols and a brown oak staircase are here.

Encircling the innards of this tree, these steps coil clock-wise to the top, the entire environment one single living thing. There are no cracks, no signs of building. Tapestries on the wall appear life-like, suspended with no visible attachments.  A breathtaking tapestry is here.

A diminutive niche in the wall provides shelter to a small family of flying squirrels. Just inside sit the young, comfortably settled into the soft bedding the parents have gathered up. A breeze carries their tiny chitters to your ears, revealing that the niche is somehow connected to the outside world as well.  A niche in the wall is here.

A large tapestry lines the outside wall of the passageway, most impressive in that it is not made of fabric, but of vines as tiny as thick hairs, growing in a weave. The delicate shadings of the plants is perfectly natural, and as the eye becomes unfocused, a picture of a diminutive, beautiful maiden sits amongst a foresty background. The wall opposite of this magnificent tapestry is lined with portraits of prominent temple leaders, the colors vibrant, bringing a life-like sense to the frames. The eyes of the maiden in the tapestry seem to follow you, staring directly as you pass, boring into your soul.  A vellum portrait, a canvas portrait, a suede portrait, a wooden framed oil painting, some unfinished portraits, and a carefully painted silk screen are here.

While the tree appears gigantic from the outside, it still is nothing compared to the impression of being on the inside. Hollow branches large enough to pass a drake branch out here, the surfaces smooth, but in a most curious way. It is apparent that no tools were used to create these passageways, yet there is no evidence to give one the impression that the passageways formed over a long period of time. The branches have grown in this manner intentionally, quite unlike any plantlife found anywhere on the land.

[Elindale's Temple, Research Library.]

The walls have grown out short, flat surfaces to serve as bookshelves. Small branches spring out of the shelves themselves to provide rests, holding up the many stacks of books collected here. The glory of Elindale can be found, scribed into these pages, as well as other points of interest. Historical novels, books of lore and tomes of knowledge are available for the temple registry to peruse. Any time spent here could prove to teach anyone something they haven't yet learned, or at the very least, one might study the tomes to learn better how to do that which they already know.  An open gilt edged leather book and a smooth oak bookshelf are here.
