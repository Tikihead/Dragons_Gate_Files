Mieglyn asks in Secian, "or both?"

Twilight says in Secian, "We have to remember, not all will ever make every meeting. But keeping information available, is key to keeping all as involved as possible."

Mieglyn nods.

Lilioth says in Secian, "oh, I think right on the scroll... makes it easier for some folks. Both would work, too."

Mystie says in Secian, "it might be best to have them posted so others can see"
