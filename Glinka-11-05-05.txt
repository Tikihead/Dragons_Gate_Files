Decorated with fragrant candles and garlands of dried leaves and berries, this small wagon exudes a truly festive feeling. Plush crimson red velvet floor cushions surround a small wooden table, which has intricate autumn scenes carved into its surface. A small stage rests in the northern corner for merchants to show off their wares. A red velvet curtain leads into a smaller room set up for the travelling body artist and hairstylist, while a beaded curtain leads into Broyce's work area.  An ornate wooden table, a Book of Specialties, a deep red velvet curtain, a glimmering purple beaded curtain, an open billowy painted wooden wagon door, and a hot wooden keg of harvest punch are here.

A black velvet cushioned stool, a small wooden tray of ink bottles, a deep red velvet curtain, a sparkling HAIR PRICES sign, a carved maple HAIR STYLES list, a rosewood LENGTH list, an inky TEXTURES list, a cheerful red EYE PRICES list, a gold-trimmed SHAPES for EYES list, and a mirror are here.

Rawnie looks like a 5'6" standard mature light boned, wiry-tough bodied Human Bard.
She has long, tied back, fine golden blonde hair, with almond shaped green eyes, and looks neat.
She appears to be tired right now.
She can be attacked by other players.

On her forehead is a faintly shimmering deep blue spiral tattoo.

On her right hand is a small, golden hummingbird tattoo.

On her left wrist is a deep blue intricate knotwork tattoo.

She appears to be in perfect health.

Physical appearance:

Thick wavy sunstreaked blonde hair is tied back with a thong that leaves enough wisps free to frame a heart shaped, deeply tanned face. Eyes of emerald green sparkle with a brightness to match this woman's ever present smile.

Decorated with fragrant candles and garlands of dried leaves and berries, this small wagon exudes a truly festive feeling. Plush crimson red velvet floor cushions surround a small wooden table, which has intricate autumn scenes carved into its surface. A small stage rests in the northern corner for merchants to show off their wares. A red velvet curtain leads into a smaller room set up for the travelling body artist and hairstylist, while a beaded curtain leads into Broyce's work area.

A yellow leafed maple tree with strong arms hangs languidly over a festively painted gypsy wagon.The voices of various merchants echo from within the wagon, barely audible over the chatter of enthusiastic festival goers. A few people stand outside the wagon, bags of candy corn and candied apples within their hands, peering through the wagon door through ornamental masks.

The sweet, spicy scent of burning wood carries on the air, giving warmth to the stinging chill of the rushing wind. To the west, circles of festival goers sit around a bonfire, warming their hands as others wonder back and forth about the festival. The wind whines a slow, lingering song as a cobblestone path winds itself up to the entrance of a warping thatched roof cabin.  A festive old man smoking a pipe, a glowing orange candle in a jar, some decaying red leaves on the ground, and an open round shaped wooden door are here.

This small town wears the black veil of night as it nestles itself behind the shadows of the eclipsed moon. A narrow trail of dust and broken flagstones ribbons itself through a maze of lifeless trees and old buildings. The wind fills the air with the scent of burning wood as its beckoning call echoes the eerie cry of howling wolves. Amidst the glowing light of lanterns, shady figures parade and dance through the heavy velvet blanket of the shadowed moon.  Some flowing black and orange silk streamers, a glowing wooden bonfire, a nebulous shadow statue, a pumpkin patch, a decrepit wooden sign, and an ominous twisted opal arch are here.

The boughs of a large apple tree hang over the well tended avenue. Below the beautiful tree stands a small fountain. Atop the fountain is an intricately carved Secian who appears to be dancing with the water as it splashes around her. Set in the marble base is a small plaque that reads, "For those who have gone before us." Many stand for a moment as they pass this way, giving thanks for the gift of life that is given by both the apple tree and the Secians of long ago. Large piles of dirt and broken stone lay on either side of the street as workmen ready the east and west alleys for expansion.  A street lantern, a closed Secian etched moonsilver door, a pair of open silver forged swinging doors, and a sign above the doors are here.

Vast estates tower over the huge Spurian wall towards the south. The well-to-do who live in these homes idle away their days, enjoying the luxury of time. Standing next to a very empty lantern pole, a small Flerian child insists in a plaintive wail, that he had nothing to do with the missing lantern. The well-dressed guard that interrogates him keeps pointing at a small sack on the ground and its obvious contents.  An open small burlap sack, a street lantern, and a lantern are here.

Southern Avenue leads between the center of Spur and the homes of the prosperous and wealthy. Several of the Ladies of the city stroll along the avenue chatting about the current events and latest gossip of the Spur. Behind them, harried servants carry their reticules and all those belongings that they cannot be without.  A street lantern is here.

Smooth stones make up the street that leads from the center of Spur to the south. Each stone has been carefully fitted for the most comfortable travel by both cart and traveler alike. A well dressed Guard patrols the area in his dress uniform. Captains don't allow for slovenly appearances on this patrol.  A street lantern is here.

[Town Square South.]

The outward appearance of the people here seems a bit classier. Rich clothing and large coin purses are prevalent amongst the travelers. In fact, many of the folk heading into Town Square from the south are accompanied by large bodyguards to assure their safety. The well maintained road is lined with small brass lanterns, each swinging off an individual pole.  A street lantern is here.

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.  A flowing white marble fountain, a marble statue of a Human, a shimmering marble statue of a Dragon, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a rosewood sign, a crisp gold lettered vellum notice, and a thick misty grey patch of swirling fog are here.

The elegant Hotel Royale towers above the street, its emerald door sparkling in the light. The patrons that stroll in and out are catered to, doors opened and closed for them, and baggage and packages carried by harried servants. The large Bank of Spur sits on the east side of the square. Its location close to the Royale is not a coincidence. A gold-trimmed door is proof of the success of this branch of the Spurian bank and those who run it.  An elegant gold-trimmed walnut door, an open emerald steel door, a street lantern, and a new rosewood sign pointing southeast are here.
