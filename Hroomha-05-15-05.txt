The cobblestone path winds its way between lush trees that bloom tiny white flowers. A gentle breeze blows through the area, causing the buds to shake and flutter softly onto the ground. Boisterous laughter can be heard echoing from within two large cottages which causes the pathway to fork to the southwest and southeast. Above one door, a sign reads "The Bounty Bar," and above the other there is a sign that reads "The Bounty Dining Hall." A few children lean lazily against one of the building structure, sipping on glasses of raspberry fizz and chocolate milk as they wait for their parents. An adolescent drag-al, grinning from ear to ear, darts out of the tavern holding a bottle of champagne, grabs his friend and drags him quickly to the southeast.  A pot of flowering red and white geraniums, a barrel shaped wooden door, a paneled mahogany door, and a silver ribboned paper horn are here.

[Spur Gateway.]

Travelers from Rathan to the northwest, and the Trade Route to the south, converge at Spur's west gate. Guards posted on the ground give those seeking to enter the city a cursory once-over. Their lack of interest shows that anyone approaching has already been observed from above for some time. A grate in the ground loosens mud from wagon wheels and hooves before they pass through the gate, helping to keep the streets of Spur fairly clean.  An open giant black iron gate, a giant green oak tree, a small blue pool, a thick oak grate over the pool, a polished stone marker, a flaming glass covered memorial candle, a flower covered marble arch, and a flaming glass covered memorial candle are here.

This area is illuminated.
Obvious paths: north* south* southwest* west* northwest*.

>[Gateway.]

The relative safety inside Spur is a comfort to those returning from the fields and mountains. To those leaving, a massive wall of defense around the city lies ahead. Archer towers beside the gate overlook the wall, offering a painful welcome to would-be invaders. Several guards on foot patrol pass and disappear behind a thick, bluesteel banded steelwood door. Wall road stretches to the south, a wide passage between the city wall and several large buildings.  An open iron gate, an open thick stone door, a street lantern, and a flaming glass covered memorial candle are here.

From the city gate to the west, Trade Way continues eastward towards the busy Merchant district, past Joyeusse's Shop. The air is thick with the scent of fresh flowers. Wagons filled with goods bound for sale trundle past, their drivers hopeful of the anticipated profits. Eager young warriors venture towards the west gate and the dangers beyond.  A closed carved rosewood door, a street lantern, a freshly painted sign, and a flaming glass covered memorial candle are here.

The wafting smell of flowers and trees float out from a well kept grey fence.  Old piles of rubble have been cleaned up and the glimpse of a sprawling park can be seen, having been planted in their stead. Beautiful and statuesque monuments dot the landscape through the gate, that remains locked, but has been festively decorated with a bright ribbon.  A street lantern, a flaming glass covered memorial candle, an open festive ribbon tied grey iron gate, and a flaming glass covered memorial candle are here.

The throngs of travelers thicken as one heads east along Trade Way. An Anthian plays softly on a strange looking stringed instrument, her melodic voice filling the air. Judging by her clothing, and the number of silvers at her feet, she makes a fine living practicing her craft.  A street lantern and a flaming glass covered memorial candle are here.

[Trade & Market.]

The buildings of Market Circle stand to the south. It becomes obvious that the area through the arch is a much cleaner marketplace than the bazaar. An inviting eatery stands beside the road, its door open to those weary after a long trip to Spur, as well as those preparing to venture to the great expanses beyond the west gate. A human couple exit the building, arm in arm. A small sign stands beside the intersection.  A sign, an open glossy lacquered oak door, a street lantern, and a flaming glass covered memorial candle are here.

[Market Street.]

Situated between the well-traveled Trade Way to the north and the fine shops of Market Circle to the south, this small stretch of road is busy at all times of day. Adventurers with sacks of plundered goods leave Market Street and head west where a shrewd businessman has set up shop in this busy area of the Market District. A small shop stands slightly to the east of the arch leading into Merchant Circle, light shining through its red glass door and illuminating the store front in a cheerful, ruby glow.  A street lantern, an opaque ruby red glass door, and a gold lettered wooden sign are here.

Market Street ends here at a large archway. People bustle in and out of the arch, some without so much as a nod. The city wall rises up to the south and west of the buildings of Market Circle. A small sign is posted on the wall beside the archway.  A street lantern is here.

[Market Circle.]

An arch between two large buildings connects Market Circle and Market Street. The more reputable shopkeepers do business within the circle, but pay higher taxes for the privilege. The buildings have been built to last, as these merchants are no traveling tinkers. Interlocking stone walkways and colorful plantings span this central area. Despite the number of animals waiting outside the bank for their owners, the area is spotless. Loud chatter in many languages can be heard from the southwest.  A marble archway, an open elegant gold-trimmed walnut door, and a wooden sign are here.

The quiet hum of business fills your ears as you enter the Market Circle branch of the Rasnian Bank.  A long wooden desk at the far end of the room contains many tellers waiting to help you with your banking needs.  An open elegant gold-trimmed walnut door, a bright wooden sign, and a shimmering gold coin are here.

[Festival of Remembrance, Celebration Village.]

Old cobblestone pathways branch off in many directions, winding through this enchanting village. The thick boughs of trees cover the path in a comforting hug. A soft glow warms the earth as the heavens' celestial orb casts a halo of through the treetops. Bells chime quietly in remembrance of those long gone.  A glowing crystal street lantern, a carved white marble block, some flowing multicolored silk streamers, a beautifully carved white marble bench, and a flower covered marble arch are here.

The cobblestone path winds its way between lush trees that bloom tiny white flowers. A gentle breeze blows through the area, causing the buds to shake and flutter softly onto the ground. Boisterous laughter can be heard echoing from within two large cottages which causes the pathway to fork to the southwest and southeast. Above one door, a sign reads "The Bounty Bar," and above the other there is a sign that reads "The Bounty Dining Hall." A few children lean lazily against one of the building structure, sipping on glasses of raspberry fizz and chocolate milk as they wait for their parents. An adolescent drag-al, grinning from ear to ear, darts out of the tavern holding a bottle of champagne, grabs his friend and drags him quickly to the southeast.  A pot of flowering red and white geraniums, a barrel shaped wooden door, a paneled mahogany door, and a silver ribboned paper horn are here.

Bright yellow rose bushes, and multicolored snapdragons, flank a sinuous path around the village. A black-tailed deer sprints with graceful and lithe movements, as he leaps over the small path. A gentle breeze wafts through the air, dizzying the tree's branches as they sway slowly. Colorful birds sing harmonious melodies while they soar through the skies.  A glowing candle filled crystal street lantern and an open dark purple tent are here.

Heavy magenta colored fabric hangs from the top post of the tent, the flowing canvas carried overhead and down the sides of the polished wooden frame, making up the walls of this enclosure. A small stage, painted plum, sits opposite the rolled tent flap and is surrounded by a variety of small flowers. Orchids, lavender and lilac emit their sweet scents into the air.  An open dark purple tent flap and a gem sign are here.

[Celebration Village, Flowery Path.]

Bright yellow rose bushes, and multicolored snapdragons, flank a sinuous path around the village. A black-tailed deer sprints with graceful and lithe movements, as he leaps over the small path. A gentle breeze wafts through the air, dizzying the tree's branches as they sway slowly. Colorful birds sing harmonious melodies while they soar through the skies.  A glowing candle filled crystal street lantern, an open dark purple tent, and a silver ribboned paper horn are here.

>[Celebration Village.]

The cobblestone path winds its way between lush trees that bloom tiny white flowers. A gentle breeze blows through the area, causing the buds to shake and flutter softly onto the ground. Boisterous laughter can be heard echoing from within two large cottages which causes the pathway to fork to the southwest and southeast. Above one door, a sign reads "The Bounty Bar," and above the other there is a sign that reads "The Bounty Dining Hall." A few children lean lazily against one of the building structure, sipping on glasses of raspberry fizz and chocolate milk as they wait for their parents. An adolescent drag-al, grinning from ear to ear, darts out of the tavern holding a bottle of champagne, grabs his friend and drags him quickly to the southeast.  A pot of flowering red and white geraniums, a barrel shaped wooden door, and a paneled mahogany door are here.

>[Festival of Remembrance, Celebration Village.]

Old cobblestone pathways branch off in many directions, winding through this enchanting village. The thick boughs of trees cover the path in a comforting hug. A soft glow warms the earth as the heavens' celestial orb casts a halo of through the treetops. Bells chime quietly in remembrance of those long gone.  A glowing crystal street lantern, a carved white marble block, some flowing multicolored silk streamers, a beautifully carved white marble bench, and a flower covered marble arch are here.

[Spur Gateway.]

Travelers from Rathan to the northwest, and the Trade Route to the south, converge at Spur's west gate. Guards posted on the ground give those seeking to enter the city a cursory once-over. Their lack of interest shows that anyone approaching has already been observed from above for some time. A grate in the ground loosens mud from wagon wheels and hooves before they pass through the gate, helping to keep the streets of Spur fairly clean.  An open giant black iron gate, a giant green oak tree, a small blue pool, a thick oak grate over the pool, a polished stone marker, a flaming glass covered memorial candle, a flower covered marble arch, and a flaming glass covered memorial candle are here.

[Gateway.]

The relative safety inside Spur is a comfort to those returning from the fields and mountains. To those leaving, a massive wall of defense around the city lies ahead. Archer towers beside the gate overlook the wall, offering a painful welcome to would-be invaders. Several guards on foot patrol pass and disappear behind a thick, bluesteel banded steelwood door. Wall road stretches to the south, a wide passage between the city wall and several large buildings.  An open iron gate, an open thick stone door, a street lantern, and a flaming glass covered memorial candle are here.

Row after row of bunks fill the enormous main room of the western guard barracks. A small chest sits at the foot of each of the bunks, holding clothing and other personal items. The simple but efficient furniture complements the neat bedding and clean walls and floors.  An open thick stone door is here.
