Standing next to the large iron gate that separates the center of town from those of the elite class are several of the Spurian Guard. They are here to assist all who pass with the simple kindness of opening a gate, or the more important task of escorting those in need to the bank or market. A young looking cadet rubs wax into the stones of the city wall, his task is daunting, but one that will teach him discipline.  An open iron gate and a street lantern are here.

[Gateway.]

An elegant, carved wooden sign hangs above the ornate gateway set into the massive wall that divides Spurs Noble District from the Town Square. You can make out city guardsmen peering down attentively at all that approach from their posts atop the imposing wall. They seem to take a greater interest in this part of town, though there does not seem to be anything threatening enough here to warrant such attention.  A gilded silver plaque and a street lantern are here.

To the north, you can make out an ornately scrolled gateway set in the base of the imposing city wall. The refined roadway of Noble Way stretches out to the south. The cobblestones of the road are smooth and even. The attention to detail shown here is a dramatic change from some of the other parts of the city.  A street lantern is here.

An unusually large home, even for this part of town, lies off to the west. It seems as if one ambitious owner is slowly buying up the lots next to his and adding them to his own. Groundskeepers are at work in the surrounding gardens, trimming and raking, so intent on their work they do not bother to acknowledge the passing traffic on the road.  A street lantern is here.

Many grand, even ostentatious, homes line this stretch of Noble Way. Most of the residents here were fortunate enough to be born into the right families. Few that live in this area have ever actually had to work for a living. Glancing at the nameplates reveals many of the recognizable names of the Spur. Some of these names could almost be considered famous.  A street lantern is here.

Noble Way continues to wind its way among the rather modestly sized, but elegant, homes of the Spur's successful. Many a peasant farmer may live in homes larger than these, but none can match the quality found here. A peaceful, luxurious feeling pervades this part of town; perhaps it is the drifting floral scents wafting from the well-tended gardens.  A closed elegant black iron gate and a street lantern are here.

Gazing down each of the nearby private drives reveals a glimpse of a luxurious home, each a miniature estate in its own right. Short, stout walls and manicured hedges serve to keep out the riffraff and to protect the small, expensive gardens. Every detail has been attended to display the exotic plants, in all their pampered perfection.  A street lantern and a closed rosewood door are here.

Leaving the exceptionally wealthy estates of the Spurian nobility, Noble Way heads toward the Town Square to the northwest. Along the roadside can be seen the in-city homes of successful merchants and other wealthy citizens of the Spur. The homes display a slightly different style, perhaps they are not quite so restrained; a touch more exuberance and freedom with materials is displayed.  A street lantern is here.

The avenue comes to a fork, with Noble Way curving from south to the northwest.

The entire avenue is composed of fine cobblestone, each level with its neighbor, providing a smooth ride for passing carriages and horses. The stones were customized by craftsmen, cut to order, rather than simply placed wherever they might fit. A few stately oaks and elms line the sides of the road, shading travelers during the daylight hours.  A street lantern is here.

Occasional gates and driveways lead back into the well-kept estates of the city's nobility, breaking and adding interest to the defining plane of the walls lining Noble Way.

A small roadway bordered by flowering hedges bisects the wide avenue of Noble Way at a right angle, heading east to west.  A thick, sturdy sign stands just off to the side of a charming path, its large friendly letters intent on luring travelers into the city's premiere roadstay, the Gilded Lion Inn. The entrance is clearly marked and welcoming, extending off to the southeast.  A wooden sign and a street lantern are here.

The occasional locked gate marks the entrance to some of the more hidden estates of Spurs nobility. From this broad avenue, little can be seen of their splendor. Behind the imposing gate recedes a proud drive, disappearing mysteriously into the trees. If not for the large imposing tower rising above the hedges it would be hard to discern anything was beyond the gate. It is apparent the residents do not wish to be disturbed.  A street lantern, a closed morbius door, and an open black iron gate are here.

A well-guarded gateway separates the city's residential district from the farmlands just beyond. Guards carefully eye all that enter or exit the city, beckoning gruffly to random travelers for a closer inspection. The structure of the guards' barracks is visible above the road to the west. A weathered wooden sign is posted by the gate.  An open stone gate, a wooden sign, a closed thick stone door, and a street lantern are here.

Through the gate lies the city of Spur, the major center of trade and civilization on the plains. The dusty road leading through the gates is well traveled, and walls of the city are in good repair. A small shack sits to the west of the road, during most times of the day a dusty coach can be seen waiting in front, its horses stomping with impatience to be gone. To the right of the door is a small window, its opening covered with metal bars. An old man, missing most of his teeth, waits patiently for the travelers to pay their fare, and then directs them into the waiting area. On the east side of the road a billowing multicolored tent has been erected, the hustle and bustle of merchants and customers can be seen coming and going at all times of the day.  A rainbow silk tent and an open iron gate are here.

Windows are little more than openings lined with small twigs and the doorway is an oval entryway covered by a large curtain of pine needles. The individual huts could not be more than three feet in height, with a few even shorter.  A faint magickal path is here.

The column in front of you is both a natural wonder and a disorganized collection of twigs, leaves, mud, and stones. It appears the huts that make up the column were made of mostly packed and dried mud, with an outer protective layer of small pebbles placed in the mud while it was drying. Each home has a semblance of a roof, made of evergreen needles, small twigs, and branches for support.

The building ahead is unlike any others in the village. The construction is not of packed mud, rather it is bark-stripped long timbers crossed and piled on top of each other. Every inch of the pale wood is carved or marked with arcane and mysterious shapes. Triangles within circles, elongated animal shapes, stick figures, concentric circles, and moon shapes are but of a few of the shapes that mark the wood. The entryway has no door, which allows a view into the interior chamber. It is barren save for an altar decorated by bowls of meat and fruits, coins and bones. The enormous skull of what could only be an alligator tops the altar.

Peering into one of the huts through the crude window, the primal nature of this village is apparent.

Peering into one of the huts through the crude window, the primal nature of this village is apparent. There are no comforts to speak of, only a collection of leaves and needles for an apparent bed and some tattered rags and skins hanging from a horn or tooth on the far wall. The skins look like mouse or rabbit hides.

This area is illuminated.
You see the 1st orange fungus warrior corpse, the 2nd orange fungus warrior, the 3rd orange fungus warrior, the 1st silvery white furred winter wolf (wearing a small gold collar), and the 1st angry pixie sentry corpse.
In the area are Orlando the Noble Human, Scruple the Noble Drag-al, and Cuervo the Noble Drag-al.

A pixie leans her head out the window of the third hut of the column in front of you. Eyes widening in disbelief, she begins to berate you in series of sharp barks, yips, and cries. It sounds more like an animal tongue than any racial tongue you have heard. Her hair is unkempt and wild, tufts of it growing up and out at angles, some dredded, some braided, some just matted. Her eyes seem too close together, and she has no noticeable nose other than two slits where it normally sits. A set of iridescent wings flitter furiously on her back.  An old leather saddle is here.

A flash of iridescence and a low humming sound alerts you that there are villagers present, even if not readily apparent by the casual glance.  A dark cavern mouth is here.

A small stream's bank sits at the back of the village. There are strange, perfectly circular tracks leading up and out from a crevice in the muddy ground. A twinkle from within an inky darkness calls your attention to a cave mouth, mostly hidden by the forest greenery. A flash of iridescence and a low humming sound alerts you that there are villagers present, even if not readily apparent by the casual glance.  A dark cavern mouth is here.

This area is illuminated.
You see the 1st silvery white furred winter wolf (wearing a small gold collar).
In the area are Orlando the Noble Human, Scruple the Noble Drag-al, and Cuervo the Noble Drag-al.

A pixie leans her head out the window of the third hut of the column in front of you. Eyes widening in disbelief, she begins to berate you in series of sharp barks, yips, and cries. It sounds more like an animal tongue than any racial tongue you have heard. Her hair is unkempt and wild, tufts of it growing up and out at angles, some dredded, some braided, some just matted. Her eyes seem too close together, and she has no noticeable nose other than two slits where it normally sits. A set of iridescent wings flitter furiously on her back.  A feathered birch spear, a small round applewood buckler, a feathered birch spear, and a wrought platinum table leg are here.

A pixie leans her head out the window of the third hut of the column in front of you. Eyes widening in disbelief, she begins to berate you in series of sharp barks, yips, and cries. It sounds more like an animal tongue than any racial tongue you have heard. Her hair is unkempt and wild, tufts of it growing up and out at angles, some dredded, some braided, some just matted. Her eyes seem too close together, and she has no noticeable nose other than two slits where it normally sits. A set of iridescent wings flitter furiously on her back.  A feathered birch spear, a small round applewood buckler, a feathered birch spear, a wrought platinum table leg, a black coral charm, some gold coins, and some silver coins are here.

There are several rows of the columns that house this village's populace. Each row has been place at a slightly curved formation, not quite a semi circle. The several rows all face towards a singular structure, the only such formation in this village that is not built under or on top of other structures. This building obviously is of great importance to the village.  A stone tribal pendant is here.

The column in front of you is both a natural wonder and a disorganized collection of twigs, leaves, mud, and stones. It appears the huts that make up the column were made of mostly packed and dried mud, with an outer protective layer of small pebbles placed in the mud while it was drying. Each home has a semblance of a roof, made of evergreen needles, small twigs, and branches for support.

On this edge of the village, several pits house red-hot coals. The pits are large relatively for the size of the villagers, some spanning close to three feet across. Over half the pits are spanned by skewered meat, slowly cooked by the rising heat from the coals. The pits are housed from the elements by a span of dried leather suspended by rope in the trees above.  A closed small iron animal snare, some silver coins, and a ceremonial burnished gold pike are here.

The column in front of you is both a natural wonder and a disorganized collection of twigs, leaves, mud, and stones. It appears the huts that make up the column were made of mostly packed and dried mud, with an outer protective layer of small pebbles placed in the mud while it was drying. Each home has a semblance of a roof, made of evergreen needles, small twigs, and branches for support.  A feathered birch spear is here.

There are several rows of the columns that house this village's populace. Each row has been place at a slightly curved formation, not quite a semi circle. The several rows all face towards a singular structure, the only such formation in this village that is not built under or on top of other structures. This building obviously is of great importance to the village.

A pixie leans her head out the window of the third hut of the column in front of you. Eyes widening in disbelief, she begins to berate you in series of sharp barks, yips, and cries. It sounds more like an animal tongue than any racial tongue you have heard. Her hair is unkempt and wild, tufts of it growing up and out at angles, some dredded, some braided, some just matted. Her eyes seem too close together, and she has no noticeable nose other than two slits where it normally sits. A set of iridescent wings flitter furiously on her back.  A feathered birch spear and a feathered birch spear are here.

Peering into one of the huts through the crude window, the primal nature of this village is apparent. There are no comforts to speak of, only a collection of leaves and needles for an apparent bed and some tattered rags and skins hanging from a horn or tooth on the far wall. The skins look like mouse or rabbit hides.

A pixie leans her head out the window of the third hut of the column in front of you. Eyes widening in disbelief, she begins to berate you in series of sharp barks, yips, and cries. It sounds more like an animal tongue than any racial tongue you have heard. Her hair is unkempt and wild, tufts of it growing up and out at angles, some dredded, some braided, some just matted. Her eyes seem too close together, and she has no noticeable nose other than two slits where it normally sits. A set of iridescent wings flitter furiously on her back.  A feathered birch spear and a feathered birch spear are here.

Peering into one of the huts through the crude window, the primal nature of this village is apparent. There are no comforts to speak of, only a collection of leaves and needles for an apparent bed and some tattered rags and skins hanging from a horn or tooth on the far wall. The skins look like mouse or rabbit hides.  A swirling multicolored globe, an empty glass vial, and an empty glass vial are here.

This area is illuminated.
You see the 1st silvery white furred winter wolf (wearing a small gold collar).

A pixie leans her head out the window of the third hut of the column in front of you. Eyes widening in disbelief, she begins to berate you in series of sharp barks, yips, and cries. It sounds more like an animal tongue than any racial tongue you have heard. Her hair is unkempt and wild, tufts of it growing up and out at angles, some dredded, some braided, some just matted. Her eyes seem too close together, and she has no noticeable nose other than two slits where it normally sits. A set of iridescent wings flitter furiously on her back.  A feathered birch spear and a feathered birch spear are here.

A pixie leans her head out the window of the third hut of the column in front of you. Eyes widening in disbelief, she begins to berate you in series of sharp barks, yips, and cries. It sounds more like an animal tongue than any racial tongue you have heard. Her hair is unkempt and wild, tufts of it growing up and out at angles, some dredded, some braided, some just matted. Her eyes seem too close together, and she has no noticeable nose other than two slits where it normally sits. A set of iridescent wings flitter furiously on her back.  A feathered birch spear and a feathered birch spear are here.

This area is illuminated.
You see the 1st elder pixie druid corpse, the 1st silvery white furred winter wolf (wearing a small gold collar), the 1st angry pixie sentry corpse, and the 2nd angry pixie sentry corpse.
In the area are Orlando the Noble Human, Scruple the Noble Drag-al, and Cuervo the Noble Drag-al.

[Forest Glade.]

A pixie leans her head out the window of the third hut of the column in front of you. Eyes widening in disbelief, she begins to berate you in series of sharp barks, yips, and cries. It sounds more like an animal tongue than any racial tongue you have heard. Her hair is unkempt and wild, tufts of it growing up and out at angles, some dredded, some braided, some just matted. Her eyes seem too close together, and she has no noticeable nose other than two slits where it normally sits. A set of iridescent wings flitter furiously on her back.  A long black leather belted robe, a ceremonial burnished gold pike, and a feathered birch spear are here.

[Forest Glade.]

The remains of several giant horned beetles are scattered on the ground. The shiny black carapaces are being cleaned of their inner organs and fluids by three male pixies. One male makes long scrapes with a bladed handle up and down the dull side of the carapaces, while another male fits them with thin leather ties through freshly made holes. The third male ties the improvised breastplates on, and nods in apparent satisfaction. As focused on their work as the winged beings are, they do not notice your approach. Multi-colored paints are worn on their faces, stripes and circles arranged on their foreheads and cheeks.

One male makes long scrapes with a bladed handle up and down the dull side of the carapaces, while another male fits them with thin leather ties through freshly made holes. The third male ties the improvised breastplates on, and nods in apparent satisfaction. As focused on their work as the winged beings are, they do not notice your approach. Multi-colored paints are worn on their faces, stripes and circles arranged on their foreheads and cheeks.

The building ahead is unlike any others in the village. The construction is not of packed mud, rather it is bark-stripped long timbers crossed and piled on top of each other. Every inch of the pale wood is carved or marked with arcane and mysterious shapes. Triangles within circles, elongated animal shapes, stick figures, concentric circles, and moon shapes are but of a few of the shapes that mark the wood. The entryway has no door, which allows a view into the interior chamber. It is barren save for an altar decorated by bowls of meat and fruits, coins and bones. The enormous skull of what could only be an alligator tops the altar.

The building ahead is unlike any others in the village. The construction is not of packed mud, rather it is bark-stripped long timbers crossed and piled on top of each other. Every inch of the pale wood is carved or marked with arcane and mysterious shapes. Triangles within circles, elongated animal shapes, stick figures, concentric circles, and moon shapes are but of a few of the shapes that mark the wood. The entryway has no door, which allows a view into the interior chamber. It is barren save for an altar decorated by bowls of meat and fruits, coins and bones. The enormous skull of what could only be an alligator tops the altar.

The building ahead is unlike any others in the village. The construction is not of packed mud, rather it is bark-stripped long timbers crossed and piled on top of each other. Every inch of the pale wood is carved or marked with arcane and mysterious shapes. Triangles within circles, elongated animal shapes, stick figures, concentric circles, and moon shapes are but of a few of the shapes that mark the wood. The entryway has no door, which allows a view into the interior chamber. It is barren save for an altar decorated by bowls of meat and fruits, coins and bones. The enormous skull of what could only be an alligator tops the altar.

This area is illuminated.
You see the 1st frowning pixie sorcerer corpse, the 1st silvery white furred winter wolf (wearing a small gold collar), the 1st angry pixie sentry corpse, and the 2nd angry pixie sentry.

[Forest Glade.]

The building ahead is unlike any others in the village. The construction is not of packed mud, rather it is bark-stripped long timbers crossed and piled on top of each other. Every inch of the pale wood is carved or marked with arcane and mysterious shapes. Triangles within circles, elongated animal shapes, stick figures, concentric circles, and moon shapes are but of a few of the shapes that mark the wood. The entryway has no door, which allows a view into the interior chamber. It is barren save for an altar decorated by bowls of meat and fruits, coins and bones. The enormous skull of what could only be an alligator tops the altar.  A feathered birch spear and a feathered birch spear are here.

[Forest Glade.]

The column in front of you is both a natural wonder and a disorganized collection of twigs, leaves, mud, and stones. It appears the huts that make up the column were made of mostly packed and dried mud, with an outer protective layer of small pebbles placed in the mud while it was drying. Each home has a semblance of a roof, made of evergreen needles, small twigs, and branches for support.

[Forest Glade.]

A pixie leans her head out the window of the third hut of the column in front of you. Eyes widening in disbelief, she begins to berate you in series of sharp barks, yips, and cries. It sounds more like an animal tongue than any racial tongue you have heard. Her hair is unkempt and wild, tufts of it growing up and out at angles, some dredded, some braided, some just matted. Her eyes seem too close together, and she has no noticeable nose other than two slits where it normally sits. A set of iridescent wings flitter furiously on her back.

Columns of crudely built huts stand easily thirty feet tall in the forest glade. Each column is comprised of ten or so homes, stacked on top of each other in a perfectly straight fashion. Windows are little more than openings lined with small twigs and the doorway is an oval entryway covered by a large curtain of pine needles. The individual huts could not be more than three feet in height, with a few even shorter.  A faint magickal path is here.

[Dark Forest, Mossy Grotto]

The wall of leaves to the southeast seclude this grotto from the rest of the forest, yet they are still the easiest way in and out of here, since a sturdy wall prohibits you from making any further progress to the northwest.  A large stone in one wall appears to have some etchings in it, but is so weathered and so covered in white moss that the markings are now indecipherable.  A mossy stone wall and an opening in the wall are here.

The trees here are quite different from those that are thriving in the rest of the forest.  The long, leafy branches hang so low that they almost form a wall, blocking your view of anything nearby.  Little patches of light must manage to sneak through here and there, since a few weeds seem to be surviving in what otherwise is a dark, dreary place.

Large branches hang down from above, casting dark shadows across the forest floor.  With every rustle of the breeze they seem to take on a life of their own, almost to the point of distracting you from the deep ravine that lies ahead, obscured by the gnarly undergrowth.

Through the gate lies the city of Spur, the major center of trade and civilization on the plains. The dusty road leading through the gates is well traveled, and walls of the city are in good repair. A small shack sits to the west of the road, during most times of the day a dusty coach can be seen waiting in front, its horses stomping with impatience to be gone. To the right of the door is a small window, its opening covered with metal bars. An old man, missing most of his teeth, waits patiently for the travelers to pay their fare, and then directs them into the waiting area. On the east side of the road a billowing multicolored tent has been erected, the hustle and bustle of merchants and customers can be seen coming and going at all times of the day.  A rainbow silk tent and an open iron gate are here.

A well-guarded gateway separates the city's residential district from the farmlands just beyond. Guards carefully eye all that enter or exit the city, beckoning gruffly to random travelers for a closer inspection. The structure of the guards' barracks is visible above the road to the west. A weathered wooden sign is posted by the gate.  An open stone gate, a wooden sign, a closed thick stone door, and a street lantern are here.

The occasional locked gate marks the entrance to some of the more hidden estates of Spurs nobility. From this broad avenue, little can be seen of their splendor. Behind the imposing gate recedes a proud drive, disappearing mysteriously into the trees. If not for the large imposing tower rising above the hedges it would be hard to discern anything was beyond the gate. It is apparent the residents do not wish to be disturbed.

Majestic elms continue to line this broad roadway, sheltering the avenue on both sides and further enhancing the grandiose atmosphere.

Though they appear wonderful places to spend an afternoon or take a picnic, the glances from those tending the estates makes it clear they are only for the invited.  A street lantern is here.

A small roadway bordered by flowering hedges bisects the wide avenue of Noble Way at a right angle, heading east to west.  A thick, sturdy sign stands just off to the side of a charming path, its large friendly letters intent on luring travelers into the city's premiere roadstay, the Gilded Lion Inn. The entrance is clearly marked and welcoming, extending off to the southeast.  A wooden sign and a street lantern are here.

Occasional gates and driveways lead back into the well-kept estates of the city's nobility, breaking and adding interest to the defining plane of the walls lining Noble Way.

A side-street heading off to the east leads to an extremely well kept neighborhood that easily surpasses everything around it in splendor and magnificence. Everything, even the carefully pruned trees and the manicured shrubbery displays a desire for elegant perfection.  A street lantern is here.

Leaving the exceptionally wealthy estates of the Spurian nobility, Noble Way heads toward the Town Square to the northwest. Along the roadside can be seen the in-city homes of successful merchants and other wealthy citizens of the Spur. The homes display a slightly different style, perhaps they are not quite so restrained; a touch more exuberance and freedom with materials is displayed.  A street lantern is here.

Gazing down each of the nearby private drives reveals a glimpse of a luxurious home, each a miniature estate in its own right. Short, stout walls and manicured hedges serve to keep out the riffraff and to protect the small, expensive gardens. Every detail has been attended to display the exotic plants, in all their pampered perfection.  A street lantern and a closed rosewood door are here.

Noble Way continues to wind its way among the rather modestly sized, but elegant, homes of the Spur's successful. Many a peasant farmer may live in homes larger than these, but none can match the quality found here. A peaceful, luxurious feeling pervades this part of town; perhaps it is the drifting floral scents wafting from the well-tended gardens.  A closed elegant black iron gate and a street lantern are here.

Many grand, even ostentatious, homes line this stretch of Noble Way. Most of the residents here were fortunate enough to be born into the right families. Few that live in this area have ever actually had to work for a living. Glancing at the nameplates reveals many of the recognizable names of the Spur. Some of these names could almost be considered famous.  A street lantern is here.

An unusually large home, even for this part of town, lies off to the west. It seems as if one ambitious owner is slowly buying up the lots next to his and adding them to his own. Groundskeepers are at work in the surrounding gardens, trimming and raking, so intent on their work they do not bother to acknowledge the passing traffic on the road.  A street lantern is here.

An elegant, carved wooden sign hangs above the ornate gateway set into the massive wall that divides Spurs Noble District from the Town Square. You can make out city guardsmen peering down attentively at all that approach from their posts atop the imposing wall. They seem to take a greater interest in this part of town, though there does not seem to be anything threatening enough here to warrant such attention.  A gilded silver plaque and a street lantern are here.

Standing next to the large iron gate that separates the center of town from those of the elite class are several of the Spurian Guard. They are here to assist all who pass with the simple kindness of opening a gate, or the more important task of escorting those in need to the bank or market. A young looking cadet rubs wax into the stones of the city wall, his task is daunting, but one that will teach him discipline.  An open iron gate and a street lantern are here.

The boughs of a large apple tree hang over the well tended avenue. Below the beautiful tree stands a small fountain. Atop the fountain is an intricately carved Secian who appears to be dancing with the water as it splashes around her. Set in the marble base is a small plaque that reads, "For those who have gone before us." Many stand for a moment as they pass this way, giving thanks for the gift of life that is given by both the apple tree and the Secians of long ago. Large piles of dirt and broken stone lay on either side of the street as workmen ready the east and west alleys for expansion.  A street lantern, a Secian etched moonsilver door, a pair of open silver forged swinging doors, and a sign above the doors are here.

Vast estates tower over the huge Spurian wall towards the south. The well-to-do who live in these homes idle away their days, enjoying the luxury of time. Standing next to a very empty lantern pole, a small Flerian child insists in a plaintive wail, that he had nothing to do with the missing lantern. The well-dressed guard that interrogates him keeps pointing at a small sack on the ground and its obvious contents.  An open small burlap sack and a street lantern are here.

The outward appearance of the people here seems a bit classier. Rich clothing and large coin purses are prevalent amongst the travelers. In fact, many of the folk heading into Town Square from the south are accompanied by large bodyguards to assure their safety. The well maintained road is lined with small brass lanterns, each swinging off an individual pole. No expense has been spared to keep those who travel this road safe from the hoodlums that relish the darkness.  A street lantern and some charred foliage are here.

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.   A flowing white marble fountain, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a cracked marble statue of a Human, a carved marble statue of a Dragon, a rosewood sign, a small jagged cobblestone crack, and a welcome mat are here.

Polished oak and gold filigree emphasize the wealth that abounds in this establishment. Well-dressed tellers stand ready to help you store your money safely or to reduce your coinage to more manageable form.  An open elegant gold-trimmed walnut door, a wooden sign, and a bright wooden sign are here.

The elegant Hotel Royale towers above the street, its emerald door sparkling in the light. The patrons that stroll in and out are catered to, doors opened and closed for them, and baggage and packages carried by harried servants. The large Bank of Spur sits on the east side of the square. Its location close to the Royale is not a coincidence. A gold-trimmed door is proof of the success of this branch of the Spurian bank and those who run it.  An elegant gold-trimmed walnut door, open emerald steel door, and a street lantern are here.

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.   A flowing white marble fountain, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a cracked marble statue of a Human, a carved marble statue of a Dragon, a rosewood sign, a small jagged cobblestone crack, and a welcome mat are here.

A peaceful bliss pervades the very core of this guilded path. Below a large oak tree a couple of Rinannian priestesses sing lightly in Secti. Several merchants pause to listen to the song. Even a few hardened warriors cannot help but smile at the sweet melody.  A large oak tree and a street lantern are here.

The distant glimmer from a temple made of white marble and pearl catches your eye. An intricate gilded iron gate and a small winding path are all that separate you from the dazzling temple of Rinanni. Majestic marble statues of doves in flight stand on either side of the gate. The gaze of their peaceful eyes seems to follow your every movement.  An open intricately gilded iron gate, a pair of pure white marble dove statues, a street lantern, and an open dragon-etched emerald door are here.

A large stone building rises just to the east of Northern Avenue. These barracks house those known as Dread Knights. It is not unusual to see patrols of this elite group heading down the street towards Town Square. One would hope their presence would allow everyone to live in peace. If only they would stop fingering their swords all the time, you might believe it yourself.  A street lantern is here.

Northern Avenue ends at a gateway set within the massive city walls. On the other side of the gate are the Guild Halls. Those who pass through accept the bond of peace that the Guilds impose on all who desire their services. On either side of the gate guards stand at attention saluting all those who pass by.  An open iron gate, an open thick stone door, and a street lantern are here.

The city walls tower high above you at the entrance to the guild district. On top of the wall, a very bored looking guard with a lazy eye watches those passing through the gate. The large guild buildings spread out around the district, bustling with the day-to-day activity of the city's guild groups.  An open iron gate and a street lantern are here.

The massive building of the Merchant's Guild looms over a vast part of the guild district. The activity at the main door of the guild is mind numbing as hundreds of citizens and merchants alike rush in and out of the guild to handle their business. While the governor has control over the city guard, many claim it is the Merchant's Guild that runs the city of Spur.  An open exquisite polished mahogany door and a street lantern are here.

To the south the road runs back into the center of the city, further to the north the city road continues on toward the other guilds. All the legal city guilds are represented within this city district except for the Forester's Guild. A sign stands beside the road to help direct lost would-be foresters to their guild hall.  A beautiful etched wooden sign and a street lantern are here.

Numerous citizens walk purposefully along the busy street. Fighters and mercenaries make up the majority, but some from almost all walks of life hurry past as well. A dejected street cleaner struggles to keep up with the messes left behind by the pets and other beasts that travel on the roads.  A street lantern is here.

Northern Avenue meets Art Avenue at this intersection. Further to the north, the Mercenary's Guild makes its home, while the Bard's and Sage's Guilds are to the east. The extravagant Merchant's Guild stands to the south. Various sponsors wave pieces of parchment in an attempt to recruit new members.  An open lustrous hammered steel door and a street lantern are here.

The sounds of clashing steel and the calls of battle fill the air near the entrance to the Mercenary's Guild. Numerous hardened warriors lean up against the walls of the building waiting for job offers, while others move in and out of the guild hall going about their daily business. By the looks of it, some of the veterans are giving a barbarian near the front door a hard time.  An open white cedar door and a street lantern are here.

A narrow steel gate leads through a short white stone wall. Beyond the gate lies the practice yard for the Mercenary's Guild. Novice mercenaries sit or stand outside the gate, either resting from their exertions or gathering their courage to enter. Piles of old bandages lie beside the road. Behind the practice yard, the incredible outer wall stands high above the city.  An open polished oak door, a street lantern, and an open narrow grey steel gate are here.

The tangy-sweet smell of metal and leather permeate the air of this shop. A stout Hithual wearing a leather apron barks an order to a young apprentice who lets out a yelp and rushes to the back of the shop to carry out his master's wishes. The shopkeeper mumbles about lazy youngsters and returns to oiling a fine looking leather weapon harness, leaving you to examine his wares on your own.   Some glowing quartz faced copper lanterns and an open polished oak door are here.
