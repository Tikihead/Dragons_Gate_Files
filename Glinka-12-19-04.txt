Sast exclaims in Secian, "Ohhh! I love this one."

Weldoian says in Secian, "It was for this reason that his Temple, the Temple of Sa, sent him to work as a Sage for the temple doing things such as researching artifacts and readin' ancient scrolls."
Weldoian says in Secian, "say Many years ago, there was a Secian named Urganzael Tardoneska.  Like many Secians, he was a healer, although his true talent was in his intelligence and curiousity."
Ignoring unknown command, "Weldoian."

Shylara smiles quietly , intently watching the story unfold.

Weldoian says in Secian, "He quickly rolled the scroll back up only to witness it crumble away."

Kiralyn nods up and down to Shylara.

Weldoian says in Secian, "And as the other gods at the time were not known for their relationship with Secians, the priests could do nothing but leave Urganzeal in his present state,"

Shylara murmurs dead?

Weldoian says in Secian, "He could not depart, howe'er, as the spell would not allow him to do so."

Shylara asks in Secian, "What happened then?"

Kiralyn murmurs, "Poor Urganzeal..."

Weldoian says in Secian, "He laid there for who knows how long when he finally saw a vision of a lovely woman."

Shylara nods to Kiralyn.

The adorable little bunny skulks nervously.

Weldoian asks in Secian, "And to her, Urganzeal asked, "Who are you?  And why won't you let me die and take this horrible spell out of the world forever?""

The adorable little bunny cleans its face.

Equality listens intently.

Weldoian says in Secian, "I am Rinanni," the vision said. "And I do not come to take your life, but to ask that you find the strength to continue living." "

Shylara beams radiantly.

Shylara exclaims in Secian, "Rinanni!"

Kiralyn smiles softly.

Weldoian says in Secian, "Ah, Rinanni, you do not understand," Urganzeal said. "You are the goddess of life and light, and what I carry is a thing of greatest death and darkness." "

Weldoian says in Secian, "But I do understand, little one," said the Kindly Lady with a sad, sweet smile. "The knowledge you carry will not let you leave this earth, for it will not let itself be destroyed until its mission is complete."

Weldoian says in Secian, "But Sa refuses to be responsible for your burden, and Odarous and Elindale refuse to take on the darkness that you carry, so none of the Gods have yet come to aid you. "

Weldoian says in Secian, "I know I am not a favorite of the Secians," said Rinanni. "I know that you think that I should take up arms against my dark brothers, and do not understand how I could love them all the same.""

Shylara murmurs a quiet prayer for Urganzeal.

Weldoian says in Secian, "But if you will allow me, I will help you to carry your terrible burden, for I cannot bear to see you lying in such a state any longer." "

Weldoian says in Secian, "I will be your servant gladly," said Urganzeal. "Because you alone have come to me in this darkness, and because you are the most beautiful thing I have ever seen." "

[Forest path.]

The path seems to be disappearing before your very eyes. Travel any way but back to the northwest is blocked by foliage so dense as to prevent any further passage into the forest. An ancient oak tree festooned with bright colorful silk ribbons stands to the side of the disappearing path. Sparkling trinkets and gems hang from every available branch, a  cheerful tinkling noise filling the air with the slightest breeze.  A giant ancient oak tree, a fragrant bluish Secian rose, a tiny oak knothole, some glowing enchanted twinkling diamond candles, a low arching branch, an elegant crystal serving tray, an elegant crystal drink tray, a beautiful silver platter, and an open multicolored patched cotton carry-all are here.

This area is illuminated.
You see the 1st adorable little bunny (wearing a small gold collar).
In the area are Shylara the Novice Secian (seated), Weldoian the Noble Secian (an adorable little bunny upon his left shoulder), Twilight the Noble Secian, Starlyn the Noble Secian (seated and holding a glowing swirling iridescent glass cube), Equality the Noble Secian (seated), and Kiralyn the Noble Secian (seated).

>                        You have visualized the following locations
                        -------------------------------------------

                                    Visualization #1 is:
The towering trees of the forest begin their ascension of the large mountain seen from the open plains of New South Lake. The root holds are precarious, as the mountain's face is especially steep on the northern side. The muddy path concludes in front of a sheer stone wall covered with verdant patches of green moss. A numbing breeze blows outward from the depths a massive cavern mouth, as if the mountain itself was exhaling ice-chilled breath. Deep-cut symbols grace the sides of the cavern entrance. They appear to be recently completed, as time, water, and weather have not yet dulled the sharp lines of the cuts.

                                    Visualization #2 is:
At the top of the steep hill, the magnificent landscape of the Silver Mountain stretches all around Crystal Snowflake Village, cradling the holiday town at its base. The path makes a sharp turn upwards along a stream, filled with icy chunks and flickering silver and gold fish. A few courageous Hithuals stand along the riverbank as they prepare to go ice diving.

                                    Visualization #3 is:
An abundant gallery of paintings depicting sacrifices and hold offerings to their god suspend from crooked iron nails. Resting beside each painting, cold black iron braziers appear to hold burned blood and bone. A few charred, blackened pieces can be found in them. Several iron chains hang along the walls of the sacrificial chamber. Along the floor, intricately placed colored slate tiles are coated in dust covered dried blood. Centering the room is a raised platform accessible through a flight of stairs. Upon this raised formation rests an altar inlaid with rows and rows of teeth.

Weldoian says in Secian, "And so Rinanni ressurrected Urganzeal, and abiding by his promise, Urganzeal became the first Secian to follow Rinanni."

Equality exclaims, "Yay!"

Shylara asks in Secian, "The very first?"

Shylara blinks in astonishment.

Weldoian says in Secian, "Leaving the Temple of Sa, he searched quite long to find a Temple of RInanni and he finally did so on a small island."

Weldoian nods to Shylara.

Shylara exclaims in Secian, "Blessed be!"

Kiralyn asks Weldoian in Secian, "How come Secians didn't follow Rinanni before Urganzeal?"

Kiralyn ponders.

Shylara nods to Kiralyn in wonder.

Weldoian says in Secian, "In anycase, there in the Temple, he served also as Sage."

Weldoian nods to Starlyn.

Weldoian says in Secian, "He stayed there for centuries, since the spell in his head allowed neither aging or death."

Weldoian's stomach growls.

Starlyn's stomach growls.

Equality asks Weldoian in Secian, "Do you know what the spell was in specific?"

Weldoian says in Secian, "One day, he was in the Library of the temple when all the candles went out, leaving him in complete darkness."

Equality listens intently to Weldoian.

Shylara says in Secian, "oooo darkness, terrible darkness"

Weldoian asks in Secian, "Who is there?" cried Urganzeal."

Shylara shivers.

Equality comforts Shylara.

Twilight pets Shylara.

Weldoian says in Secian, "You do not know me," a voice said, and indeed Urganzeal did not recognize it. It was the voice of a man, and it carried an accent he did not recognize. It seemed to come from very far above. "You have something that I want," the voice continued."

Weldoian says in Secian, "And you shall give it to me. Now." "

Weldoian says in Secian, "And then, from the darkness, emerged two dark eyes."

Weldoian says in Secian, "Suddenly, Urganzeal knew what this stranger was."

Equality grins slightly.

Shylara hugs Kiralyn tightly.

Weldoian says in Secian, "Urganzeal laid there for quite a long time before Rinanni once again appeared to him."

Kiralyn leans her head on Shylara's shoulder.

Shylara says in Secian, "He was alone again"

Weldoian exclaims in Secian, "Oh, Rinanni!" Urganzeal cried. "I have failed you! How you must despise me!" "

Shylara hugs Kiralyn, pulling .

Weldoian asks in Secian, "Despise you?" said the goddess. "Oh, littlest Urganzeal, how could I despise you? You have been the bravest of your kind for years beyond measuring. All things end, all defenses fail. You have not failed me; you have honored me." "
