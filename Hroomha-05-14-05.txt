The cobblestone path winds its way between lush trees that bloom tiny white flowers. A gentle breeze blows through the area, causing the buds to shake and flutter softly onto the ground. Boisterous laughter can be heard echoing from within two large cottages which causes the pathway to fork to the southwest and southeast. Above one door, a sign reads "The Bounty Bar," and above the other there is a sign that reads "The Bounty Dining Hall." A few children lean lazily against one of the building structure, sipping on glasses of raspberry fizz and chocolate milk as they wait for their parents. An adolescent drag-al, grinning from ear to ear, darts out of the tavern holding a bottle of champagne, grabs his friend and drags him quickly to the southeast.

Travelers from Rathan to the northwest, and the Trade Route to the south, converge at Spur's west gate. Guards posted on the ground give those seeking to enter the city a cursory once-over. Their lack of interest shows that anyone approaching has already been observed from above for some time. A grate in the ground loosens mud from wagon wheels and hooves before they pass through the gate, helping to keep the streets of Spur fairly clean.  An open giant black iron gate, a giant green oak tree, a small blue pool, a thick oak grate over the pool, a polished stone marker, a flaming glass covered memorial candle, a flower covered marble arch, and a flaming glass covered memorial candle are here.

A large gate separates the Merchant District and Town Square-the hub of Spur's activity. The partially opened gate is currently able to accommodate the simultaneous passage of several locals and visitors, but can be expanded to accept carriages, or sealed to ward against invasion.

Entering you are greeted with the most fantastic aroma of distant recipes and exotic ingredients wafting through the air. Fragrant and strangely shaped brass oil lamps hang from the ceiling, casting ample but irregular light below. The walls are draped in bright velvets and interwoven with swirling burnished gold and silvers. On top of the etched sandstone and silken-carpeted flooring, a wide variety of brass and copper tables and adjoining chairs invite you to sit and enjoy a drink. Luckily there are a few unoccupied tables, as discerning customers have already claimed many. In the corners, booths skillfully draped with cloth ensure privacy from prying eyes. In the back an exotically clad go-blin-al chats with patrons from behind a copper topped counter, serving a wide variety of foreign food and drink. Nearby, soothing music streams from a talented pair of young musicians. You are just barely able to catch a glimpse of the flurry of activity in the kitchen through some flowing curtains behind the counter.  A copper topped glass counter, some dangerously tall copper barstools, some exotic style table and chairs, some orange pinstriped broadcloth reclining couches, and an open elegantly embossed copper door are here.

To one side of the room are several large barrels filled to the very top with sugar. The air is filled with the smell of the many kinds of sweets, pastries, and confections contained within the shop's main counter, which is made of large panels of blue sapphire, set in a golden frame and cut thinly enough to be transparent, lending a slight bluish tinge to the goods contained within. Behind the counter, a drake-shaped blue statue sits on a shelf below a large banner, which reads, "Why go to Rathan or Saldaea for your sweet needs when I provide them right here?" Below this banner, a smaller one reads "Sugar is not the only thing sold here." Next to the statue is a small disclaimer set in a sapphire frame.

The sweet smelling aroma of fresh cut roses combined with fragrant scented oils from a nearby display table greets visitors romantically as they enter the store. Several small tables draped in shiny black silks have been set up around the shop, each showing off a certain theme of items. A single rack of clothing in the rear offers a sexy selection of evening wear that is sure to compliment the oils and lotions on display at the front of the store. A drawn velvet curtain offers privacy to customers wanting to try on some of the more revealing outfits. A soft glow from the many candles throughout the room adds to the seductive atmosphere. A lovely delicately elven maiden smiles warmly at you from behind the counter, waiting to assist your every need. Just behind her is a wide assortment of fine wines and breathtaking goblets designed for romantic evenings. The counter is filled with rich chocolates and other sensual foods that are sure to set the mood no matter what the occasion.  A ruby encrusted arch is here.

Directly in the center of the intersection lies a tastefully sized polished gray granite fountain. The streets around the fountain are flooded with people of all races and sizes, rushing about from shop to shop. A group of Humans are standing just to one side of the fountain, conversing in their language, and gesturing at a particular shop that looks to cater to everyone but Humans. A San Elf stands just to one side, his eyes darting every now and then towards the groups coin purses.  A polished grey granite fountain, a glowing elegant wrought iron street lantern, a moonsilver-etched sign, a ruby encrusted arch, a sturdy blackened oak door, an open heavy wooden eight-paneled door, and an exquisite stained-glass trinket shop doorway are here.

A bell above the door tinkles as you enter this cluttered shop. Light filters in through a dusty window and glints off various metals and gemstones around the room, a bright blue and purple glass mosaic lamp on the counter provides further illumination. Weapon and armor racks are scattered haphazardly around the room, though the most valuable are displayed on a pair of ornate racks in the center of the room. A glass-fronted curio cabinet against one wall allows for the display of jewelry, several lockpicks and an array of trinkets. The glass-fronted counter contains a number of carefully labeled bottles and jars. A tall, metallic silver-eyed youth clad in simple brown clothing apart from an ornate dragon-shaped bluesteel pendant sits on an old stool behind the cluttered counter, idly flipping through the pages of a book. Behind the shopkeeper atop a cluttered bookshelf is a heavy steelwood lockbox; deeply carved into its lid is an arcane rune that glows with a faint green light.   A sturdy blackened oak door is here.

An assortment of small locked glass display cases atop finely carved mahogany pedestals are placed about this shop.  Each case contains a unique and exquisite piece of fine jewelry, polished to shine in the light cast by the large glowing crystal chandelier hanging from the center of the ceiling.  A locked glass-fronted duskwood case towards the rear of the shop is filled with figurines, some more ordinary looking jewelry and assorted collectibles.  One of the pale grey walls is covered with a beautiful mural of a forest grove - a light fog flecked with gold swirls through the trees and in the center are two gleaming golden eyes, the form of the muscular tiger they belong to barely outlined in the fog. The other walls are hung with charts listing the properties of precious and semi-precious gems and metals and the various methods of gemstone cutting.   An exquisite stained-glass door is here.

Larger, more extravagant shops fill the end of this road. There are Thugian guards stationed outside several of the shops, eyeing the customers warily. The guard closest to you is currently engaged in the enlightened task of picking his nose. A young Psycian couple is speaking loudly with the proprietor of a jewelry shop about the ring on the female's finger. Large puffs of smoke emanate from several Drag-al, seated outside the cigar shop across the street.  An open darkened cherry wood door, a closed sturdy red barred door, a large official sign, and a glowing elegant wrought iron street lantern are here.

Clear crystal display cases sit interspersed on gold-veined black marble flooring, giving a perfect view of items for sale. A soft charming glow reflects from rune symbols embedded in the darkened cherry wood walls. Tiny crystal prisms dangle from the ceiling, catching the light as they stir faintly from a mysterious unseen wind that lightly circulates around the store. The only things out of place in this elegant environment are paintings on the walls of a Leuian and a lawn gnome in various locations as well as a lawn gnome in the front of the shop, with a card in front of it entitled, "Dufus."  A brightly painted grinning lawn gnome and an open darkened cherry wood door are here.

Larger, more extravagant shops fill the end of this road. There are Thugian guards stationed outside several of the shops, eyeing the customers warily. The guard closest to you is currently engaged in the enlightened task of picking his nose. A young Psycian couple is speaking loudly with the proprietor of a jewelry shop about the ring on the female's finger. Large puffs of smoke emanate from several Drag-al, seated outside the cigar shop across the street.  An open darkened cherry wood door, a closed sturdy red barred door, a large official sign, and a glowing elegant wrought iron street lantern are here.

A San Elf stands just to one side, his eyes darting every now and then towards the groups coin purses.

The wafting smell of flowers and trees float out from a well kept grey fence.

Beautiful and statuesque monuments dot the landscape through the gate, that remains locked, but has been festively decorated with a bright ribbon.

The relative safety inside Spur is a comfort to those returning from the fields and mountains. To those leaving, a massive wall of defense around the city lies ahead. Archer towers beside the gate overlook the wall, offering a painful welcome to would-be invaders. Several guards on foot patrol pass and disappear behind a thick, bluesteel banded steelwood door. Wall road stretches to the south, a wide passage between the city wall and several large buildings.  An open iron gate, an open thick stone door, a street lantern, and a flaming glass covered memorial candle are here.

Travelers from Rathan to the northwest, and the Trade Route to the south, converge at Spur's west gate. Guards posted on the ground give those seeking to enter the city a cursory once-over. Their lack of interest shows that anyone approaching has already been observed from above for some time. A grate in the ground loosens mud from wagon wheels and hooves before they pass through the gate, helping to keep the streets of Spur fairly clean.

A Ranger slides past you and disappears into a large wagon. The bag he carries wiggles as he moves. Through the trees, children can be seen hunting for berries and nuts. Their dearest wish is to find enough to be allowed special entrance into the wagon to feed the cute animals. A variety of noises, a cacophony of animals, resounds from the brightly colored wagon.

Various large wooden crates and cages are set upon the floor, while smaller glass containers line shelving against the back wall of the wagon, each housing a single animal waiting for adoption. A bright green parrot perches atop a branch of a small potted tree, growling menacingly and barking at any who come near its territory. It then squawks, winks one eye and repeats, "Just kidding, just kidding."  A small gnarled potted tree and an open brightly painted mahogany wagon door are here.

An arch between two large buildings connects Market Circle and Market Street. The more reputable shopkeepers do business within the circle, but pay higher taxes for the privilege. The buildings have been built to last, as these merchants are no traveling tinkers. Interlocking stone walkways and colorful plantings span this central area. Despite the number of animals waiting outside the bank for their owners, the area is spotless. Loud chatter in many languages can be heard from the southwest.  A marble archway, an open elegant gold-trimmed walnut door, and a wooden sign are here.

Situated between the well-traveled Trade Way to the north and the fine shops of Market Circle to the south, this small stretch of road is busy at all times of day. Adventurers with sacks of plundered goods leave Market Street and head west where a shrewd businessman has set up shop in this busy area of the Market District. A small shop stands slightly to the east of the arch leading into Merchant Circle, light shining through its red glass door and illuminating the store front in a cheerful, ruby glow.

Situated between the well-traveled Trade Way to the north and the fine shops of Market Circle to the south, this small stretch of road is busy at all times of day. Adventurers with sacks of plundered goods leave Market Street and head west where a shrewd businessman has set up shop in this busy area of the Market District. A small shop stands slightly to the east of the arch leading into Merchant Circle, light shining through its red glass door and illuminating the store front in a cheerful, ruby glow.

An inviting eatery stands beside the road, its door open to those weary after a long trip to Spur, as well as those preparing to venture to the great expanses beyond the west gate.

The cobblestone path beneath your feet quickly gives way to multicolored polished tiles, arranged in a random fashion on the ground. Many shops of assorted size and wares line the sides of the road. A merchant can even be seen standing in the street, announcing the lowest prices in the land on various items. A second merchant just down the road announces in a snide voice that such wares can be found even cheaper at his shop.  A closed ruby-studded dragon-etched steel door, an open elegantly embossed copper door, and a glowing elegant wrought iron street lantern are here.

Behind the counter, a drake-shaped blue statue sits on a shelf below a large banner, which reads, "Why go to Rathan or Saldaea for your sweet needs when I provide them right here?" Below this banner, a smaller one reads "Sugar is not the only thing sold here." Next to the statue is a small disclaimer set in a sapphire frame.

Warm homey scents assail your senses as you wander in to this quaint shop.  Simmering potpourri pots placed through out the room are the source of these comforting scents. The comfortable feelings that surround you make you want to linger in this cheerfully cluttered shop. A small sapphire winged Secian statue stands near the door, cheerfully holding a sign that says, "Welcome all shoppers." The shop owner's eclectic tastes are illustrated with the variety of items for sale. Along one wall are musical instruments of all kinds, along with sheet music and carrying cases. Bags of every shape and size imaginable are found on racks and shelves in the back of the show area. Shields of all types are displayed behind the counters, some simple, some ornate and polished, all ready to serve as a strong defense against assailants. The display cases are filled with all kinds of shiny trinkets and knick-knacks that glitter and sparkle in the bright light of the sapphire glass lanterns hanging from the ceiling.  A sapphire winged Secian statue, a glass covered display case, and an open sapphire inlaid bluesteel door are here.

Directly in the center of the intersection lies a tastefully sized polished gray granite fountain. The streets around the fountain are flooded with people of all races and sizes, rushing about from shop to shop. A group of Humans are standing just to one side of the fountain, conversing in their language, and gesturing at a particular shop that looks to cater to everyone but Humans. A San Elf stands just to one side, his eyes darting every now and then towards the groups coin purses.

A bell above the door tinkles as you enter this cluttered shop. Light filters in through a dusty window and glints off various metals and gemstones around the room, a bright blue and purple glass mosaic lamp on the counter provides further illumination. Weapon and armor racks are scattered haphazardly around the room, though the most valuable are displayed on a pair of ornate racks in the center of the room. A glass-fronted curio cabinet against one wall allows for the display of jewelry, several lockpicks and an array of trinkets. The glass-fronted counter contains a number of carefully labeled bottles and jars. A tall, metallic silver-eyed youth clad in simple brown clothing apart from an ornate dragon-shaped bluesteel pendant sits on an old stool behind the cluttered counter, idly flipping through the pages of a book. Behind the shopkeeper atop a cluttered bookshelf is a heavy steelwood lockbox; deeply carved into its lid is an arcane rune that glows with a faint green light.   A sturdy blackened oak door is here.

A bell above the door tinkles as you enter this cluttered shop. Light filters in through a dusty window and glints off various metals and gemstones around the room, a bright blue and purple glass mosaic lamp on the counter provides further illumination. Weapon and armor racks are scattered haphazardly around the room, though the most valuable are displayed on a pair of ornate racks in the center of the room. A glass-fronted curio cabinet against one wall allows for the display of jewelry, several lockpicks and an array of trinkets. The glass-fronted counter contains a number of carefully labeled bottles and jars. A tall, metallic silver-eyed youth clad in simple brown clothing apart from an ornate dragon-shaped bluesteel pendant sits on an old stool behind the cluttered counter, idly flipping through the pages of a book. Behind the shopkeeper atop a cluttered bookshelf is a heavy steelwood lockbox; deeply carved into its lid is an arcane rune that glows with a faint green light.   A sturdy blackened oak door is here.

Intricate red wood paneling lines the walls of this shop, darkening the room and soothing the eyes. Candle light flickers dimly from evenly spaced wall sconces adding a bit of mysticism to the store while the sweet smell of cedar permeates your senses.

A large cedar humidor stands behind the smooth granite topped sales counter where a sharp featured San Elf leisurely awaits your request.  An open heavy wooden eight-paneled door is here.

Directly in the center of the intersection lies a tastefully sized polished gray granite fountain. The streets around the fountain are flooded with people of all races and sizes, rushing about from shop to shop. A group of Humans are standing just to one side of the fountain, conversing in their language, and gesturing at a particular shop that looks to cater to everyone but Humans. A San Elf stands just to one side, his eyes darting every now and then towards the groups coin purses.  A polished grey granite fountain, a glowing elegant wrought iron street lantern, a moonsilver-etched sign, a ruby encrusted arch, a sturdy blackened oak door, an open heavy wooden eight-paneled door, and an exquisite stained-glass trinket shop doorway are here.

An assortment of small locked glass display cases atop finely carved mahogany pedestals are placed about this shop.  Each case contains a unique and exquisite piece of fine jewelry, polished to shine in the light cast by the large glowing crystal chandelier hanging from the center of the ceiling.  A locked glass-fronted duskwood case towards the rear of the shop is filled with figurines, some more ordinary looking jewelry and assorted collectibles.  One of the pale grey walls is covered with a beautiful mural of a forest grove - a light fog flecked with gold swirls through the trees and in the center are two gleaming golden eyes, the form of the muscular tiger they belong to barely outlined in the fog. The other walls are hung with charts listing the properties of precious and semi-precious gems and metals and the various methods of gemstone cutting.   An exquisite stained-glass door is here.

Directly in the center of the intersection lies a tastefully sized polished gray granite fountain. The streets around the fountain are flooded with people of all races and sizes, rushing about from shop to shop. A group of Humans are standing just to one side of the fountain, conversing in their language, and gesturing at a particular shop that looks to cater to everyone but Humans. A San Elf stands just to one side, his eyes darting every now and then towards the groups coin purses.  A polished grey granite fountain, a glowing elegant wrought iron street lantern, a moonsilver-etched sign, a ruby encrusted arch, a sturdy blackened oak door, an open heavy wooden eight-paneled door, and an exquisite stained-glass trinket shop doorway are here.

The cobblestone path beneath your feet quickly gives way to multicolored polished tiles, arranged in a random fashion on the ground. Many shops of assorted size and wares line the sides of the road. A merchant can even be seen standing in the street, announcing the lowest prices in the land on various items. A second merchant just down the road announces in a snide voice that such wares can be found even cheaper at his shop.

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.   A flowing white marble fountain, a marble statue of a Human, a highly polished marble statue of a Dragon, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a giant bunch of yellow and white daffodils, and a rosewood sign are here.

The traffic on the northern street heading away from town square is an eclectic bunch.  Those who belong to the guilds to the north travel in packs on their way to and from guild events.  It is not unusual to see a group of armored fighters passing a group of robed clerics, each heading in the opposite direction. The large temple of Rinanni rises to the north, its white marble almost glowing in the light.  A street lantern and some dust are here.

Through the gate lies the city of Spur, the major center of trade and civilization on the plains. The dusty road leading through the gates is well traveled, and walls of the city are in good repair. A small shack sits to the west of the road, during most times of the day a dusty coach can be seen waiting in front, its horses stomping with impatience to be gone. To the right of the door is a small window, its opening covered with metal bars. An old man, missing most of his teeth, waits patiently for the travelers to pay their fare, and then directs them into the waiting area. On the east side of the road a billowing multicolored tent has been erected, the hustle and bustle of merchants and customers can be seen coming and going at all times of the day.  An open iron gate and a rainbow silk tent are here.

The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.

A large gate separates the Merchant District and Town Square-the hub of Spur's activity. The partially opened gate is currently able to accommodate the simultaneous passage of several locals and visitors, but can be expanded to accept carriages, or sealed to ward against invasion.  Guards stand sentry from atop the wall as well as the ground.  A street lantern and a flaming glass covered memorial candle are here.

Many townsfolk pass along this busy thoroughfare. Rich and poor alike mix freely on this street, much to the dismay of a passing nobleman. A young human struggles with an armful of packages and two young children in tow. Those in need of goods or supplies head west towards the market, those looking for the news of the day head east towards Town Square.  A street lantern and a flaming glass covered memorial candle are here.

A path to the north winds its way among various stalls and tents. Some specialty outlets can be found, provided one does not get lost in this maze known as the Bazaar. More permanent structures to the south suggest finer goods as well as increased security.  A street lantern and a flaming glass covered memorial candle are here.

This well-worn road separates the Bazaar to the north and Market Circle to the south. Only a Thugian could appreciate the layered odors of simmering foodstuffs and shoppers from the Bazaar. Crowds of people push past, some brushing against you. It might be a good idea to keep an eye on your coinpurse.  A street lantern and a flaming glass covered memorial candle are here.

The buildings of Market Circle stand to the south. It becomes obvious that the area through the arch is a much cleaner marketplace than the bazaar. An inviting eatery stands beside the road, its door open to those weary after a long trip to Spur, as well as those preparing to venture to the great expanses beyond the west gate. A human couple exit the building, arm in arm. A small sign stands beside the intersection.  A sign, an open glossy lacquered oak door, a street lantern, and a flaming glass covered memorial candle are here.

The throngs of travelers thicken as one heads east along Trade Way. An Anthian plays softly on a strange looking stringed instrument, her melodic voice filling the air. Judging by her clothing, and the number of silvers at her feet, she makes a fine living practicing her craft.  A street lantern and a flaming glass covered memorial candle are here.

The wafting smell of flowers and trees float out from a well kept grey fence.  Old piles of rubble have been cleaned up and the glimpse of a sprawling park can be seen, having been planted in their stead. Beautiful and statuesque monuments dot the landscape through the gate, that remains locked, but has been festively decorated with a bright ribbon.  A street lantern, a flaming glass covered memorial candle, an open festive ribbon tied grey iron gate, and a flaming glass covered memorial candle are here.

From the city gate to the west, Trade Way continues eastward towards the busy Merchant district, past Joyeusse's Shop. The air is thick with the scent of fresh flowers. Wagons filled with goods bound for sale trundle past, their drivers hopeful of the anticipated profits. Eager young warriors venture towards the west gate and the dangers beyond.  A closed carved rosewood door, a street lantern, a freshly painted sign, and a flaming glass covered memorial candle are here.

The relative safety inside Spur is a comfort to those returning from the fields and mountains. To those leaving, a massive wall of defense around the city lies ahead. Archer towers beside the gate overlook the wall, offering a painful welcome to would-be invaders. Several guards on foot patrol pass and disappear behind a thick, bluesteel banded steelwood door. Wall road stretches to the south, a wide passage between the city wall and several large buildings.  An open iron gate, an open thick stone door, a street lantern, and a flaming glass covered memorial candle are here.

Travelers from Rathan to the northwest, and the Trade Route to the south, converge at Spur's west gate. Guards posted on the ground give those seeking to enter the city a cursory once-over. Their lack of interest shows that anyone approaching has already been observed from above for some time. A grate in the ground loosens mud from wagon wheels and hooves before they pass through the gate, helping to keep the streets of Spur fairly clean.  An open giant black iron gate, a giant green oak tree, a small blue pool, a thick oak grate over the pool, a polished stone marker, a flaming glass covered memorial candle, a flower covered marble arch, and a flaming glass covered memorial candle are here.

In the dusty distance, Spur's great wall demarks the southern end of this well-traveled merchant's road. Soaring majestically to the north stands the spiky pinnacles and snow topped peaks of an epic mountain range so immense that it separates lands, races, and cultures. Connecting the two is a merchant road built long ago.

Intersecting trails make a "Y" the trunk of which leads due east into the woods. Within a retreating clearing the burned out remains of a cottage have become the homes of foxes and tendrils of grass. Each of the paths was once over grown but now appears to be again in use. A freshly beaten footpath makes a shortcut to Mitki's staples-shop and weaves back eastward, down the middle of the trail.  An old vegetable garden is here.

Tufts of grass grow in an odd pattern across the ground, their roots frantically attempting to find what little nourishment remains in the soil.

What may have, at one time, been a continuation of the southern orchard can now only be described as some sort of aberration. Rising from the center of the area is a pile of obsidian stones; the chaotic aura that emanates from them has tainted the entire area.

Their lack of interest shows that anyone approaching has already been observed from above for some time. A grate in the ground loosens mud from wagon wheels and hooves before they pass through the gate, helping to keep the streets of Spur fairly clean.  An open giant black iron gate, a giant green oak tree, a small blue pool, a thick oak grate over the pool, a polished stone marker, a flaming glass covered memorial candle, a flower covered marble arch, and a flaming glass covered memorial candle are here.

The tangy-sweet smell of metal and leather permeate the air of this shop. A stout Hithual wearing a leather apron barks an order to a young apprentice who lets out a yelp and rushes to the back of the shop to carry out his master's wishes. The shopkeeper mumbles about lazy youngsters and returns to oiling a fine looking leather weapon harness, leaving you to examine his wares on your own.

This room is illuminated.
Obvious exits: None.
