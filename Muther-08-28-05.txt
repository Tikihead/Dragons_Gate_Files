The chipped bark path widens to encompass a broad square between the peaked roofs of the village homes, the larger storefronts, and several communal buildings that all surround a magnificent fountain crafted from local sandstone. The multi-tiered fountain flows with pure, clean springwater and provides seating around its broad base.  The towering trees surround the village, enclosing the square in a living frame.  To the west is a sturdy building with its door perpetually ajar. A line of Leuian children trots off towards the north, bearing their lessons. The faint ding of nautical bells flows in on the breeze from the northwest.   A flowing gold-flecked sandstone fountain is here.

The multi-tiered fountain flows with pure, clean springwater and provides seating around its broad base.  The towering trees surround the village, enclosing the square in a living frame.  To the west is a sturdy building with its door perpetually ajar. A line of Leuian children trots off towards the north, bearing their lessons. The faint ding of nautical bells flows in on the breeze from the northwest.   A flowing gold-flecked sandstone fountain is here.

This area is illuminated.
In the area are Hott the Noble Leuian (seated), Crax the Leuian (seated), Dac the Leuian (seated), Kandil the Leuian (seated), Shaleu the Leuian (seated), Lthe the Leuian (seated), and Siobahn the Leuian (seated).

Siobahn frowns slightly.

Hott says in Leuian, "run like rabbit"

Shaleu says in Leuian, "at the moment I can not possibly see how they can be beaten"

Shaleu says in Leuian, "we can kill a dozen here or there, but they keep a coming"

Crax sighs.

Crax raises his hand.

Shaleu says in Leuian, "I don't mind going on raids or just fighting them myself"

Hott says in Leuian, "for every one ye kill three more come in"

Shaleu says in Leuian, "but the question that should be discussed is how do we actually defeat this foe"

Shaleu shrugs.

Shaleu says in Leuian, "done"

Kandil says to Crax in Leuian, "okay"

Crax stands up.

Crax says, "I've been going on the raids   for weeks now"

Lthe smiles at Siobahn.

Crax says, "while this army is indeen mighty and its resources seem limitless...a concerted effort of several lage groups of aradathian residents should be able to sweep through them..."

Crax says, "but a battle plans needs to be drawn up    and enough volunteers to make it work..."

Hott raises his hand.

Dac stands up.

Dac has left Kandil's group.

Dac sighs.

Dac, fading into silence, just went east.

Crax says, "would take at least 10 per group...maybe 5 6 groups"

The chipped bark path widens to encompass a broad square between the peaked roofs of the village homes, the larger storefronts, and several communal buildings that all surround a magnificent fountain crafted from local sandstone.

Crax says, "and hope the resources of this army are finite"

Crax says, "if they're not   won't matter what any of us do"

Crax shrugs.

Crax sits down.

Kandil stands up.

Kandil asks in Leuian, "okay then the question is where does the Pride fit into this solution? "

Lthe nods.

Crax says in Leuian, "decide where we stand and commit to action and let it be know to Spus town council I suppose"

Kandil says in Leuian, "I suggest we all keep ours ears open and our Claws ready to aid as we can, and share information with kyn wether its meeting night or not"

Lthe ponders the meaning of the universe for a moment.

Lthe raises her hand.

Kandil says to Lthe in Leuian, "okay"

Kandil sits down.

Lthe stands up.

Siobahn's stomach growls.
You see Crax take a drink from the flowing gold-flecked sandstone fountain.

Lthe says in Leuian, "One thing we might consider doing, in line with Crax's comments, is to put together a group of 8-10 members to carry out such raids"

Lthe says in Leuian, "That could be our particular contribution to the common defense"

Kandil says in Leuian, "so i think we can agree , in this case with those guildlines it can be done honorably, if we divide now we will fall that much faster"

Hott nods.

Shaleu raises an eyebrow.

Shaleu raises her hand.

Kandil asks in Leuian, "now as far as a large group breaking through, yes its possible , but what would break through too? what would be the target ?"

Kandil says to Shaleu in Leuian, "sorry go ahead"

Kandil sits down.

Shaleu shrugs.

Hott listens intently.

Shaleu says in Leuian, "just was going to suggest maybe striving for deividing your forces so leuians could attack  with kyn and honorable lakars and anther group with the sepents"

Shaleu says in Leuian, "within the same area"

Shaleu says in Leuian, "same time"

Shaleu smiles.

You nod to Siobahn.

Hott raises his hand.

Siobahn says in Leuian, "I do not pay them any heed when in battle, so I would hope if we had a change to deplete the foes forces, it would be united."

Siobahn bows her head.

Siobahn says in Leuian, "That is all."

Siobahn sits down.

Crax says in Leuian, "first to help answer Hott's earlier question....Kenetic has arranged it that no kyn will be asked to join a raiding party containing a serpent or taathian...but they may of course do so as they wish"

Siobahn raises an eyebrow.

Crax says in Leuian, "second to answer Lthe about an all Kkhat party...I do not believe we have the strength in arms to do so..."

A tall, plain building occupies the west edge of the square. The door remains open, its wood smoothed by the touch of hands and its kick plate, dented and scuffed.  Several adult Leuians discuss current events in hushed tones as small khits dash around them, playing a game of Alarian tag.    A hand-carved redwood sign is here.
