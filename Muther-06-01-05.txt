The ceiling slopes upward and the cavern opens up considerably, allowing more room to breathe and move around than in the other chambers. Resting upon the center of the algae-laden floor is a sarcophagus that has been heavily decorated and seemingly enshrined. Stone columns to either side of the huge marble coffin have been etched to depict the scene of a peaceful harvest. For some reason, it doesn't seem that the peacefulness expressed in the columns has made its way into this darkened crypt.  A closed ivy etched marble sarcophagus and a pair of spiraling sculpted stone columns are here.

This area is not illuminated.
You see the 1st decaying fir elf zombie, the 2nd decaying fir elf zombie, the 3rd decaying fir elf zombie, the 1st charred skeleton, and the 2nd charred skeleton.

Thin stone columns line the walls throughout this cavernous passage, each of them carved with different spiraling scenes of prosperous times; a full harvest, a boom of exploration, a grand feast. The individuals within the sculpted stone wear their finest clothes as well as their most enthusiastic smiles, but the crypt is still contaminated with unease. Quiet whispers snake their way throughout the chamber, incomprehensible in language, but thoroughly obvious in tone -- the people whose remains are nestled in this crypt do not rest in peace.

A cracked mosaic of colored tiles decorates the western wall of this cavern; thick moss threatening to overcome its stark, haunting beauty. The mosiac itself depicts a scene of Firian mourners gathered within a felled city, the bodies of their brethren piled amongst the scorched landscape. A tarnished bronze plaque has been set in the lower right corner of the mosaic, etched in an ancient Firian dialect. A bitter breeze blows in from the south, and it brings with it the faint sound of a child's cry.  A tarnished bronze plaque is here.

The ceiling slopes upward and the cavern opens up considerably, allowing more room to breathe and move around than in the other chambers. Resting upon the center of the algae-laden floor is a sarcophagus that has been heavily decorated and seemingly enshrined. Stone columns to either side of the huge marble coffin have been etched to depict the scene of a peaceful harvest. For some reason, it doesn't seem that the peacefulness expressed in the columns has made its way into this darkened crypt.  A closed ivy etched marble sarcophagus and a pair of spiraling sculpted stone columns are here.

A cracked mosaic of colored tiles decorates the western wall of this cavern; thick moss threatening to overcome its stark, haunting beauty. The mosiac itself depicts a scene of Firian mourners gathered within a felled city, the bodies of their brethren piled amongst the scorched landscape. A tarnished bronze plaque has been set in the lower right corner of the mosaic, etched in an ancient Firian dialect. A bitter breeze blows in from the south, and it brings with it the faint sound of a child's cry.  A tarnished bronze plaque, a closed muddy iron coffer, and an ugly green troll mask are here.

Several simple iron sconces line the moss covered walls of this narrow passageway, long since snuffed out. Portruding slightly from the smooth rock on either side of the chamber are several rows of stone slabs, each labeled in etchings that time has rendered indescernible. At the northeastern end of the chamber, a slab is missing, leaving a deep, square hole in the cavern wall. A slight chilled breeze whisps its way about the chamber and lingers near the exposed indention.  A deep square hole in the wall, a miniature snarling coral tiger medallion, and a crude hand-carved ebony snake figurine are here.

The spongy, algae-covered bottom of this dank chamber houses several species of strange fungi, filling the air with an overpowering, moldy stench. Thick mosses have wound their way up the smooth rock walls, leaving very few areas where the stone remains uncovered. Upon the exposed spots of the rock walls, faded etched patterns of knotwork designs lie, signifying that while the cavern itself may be a natural work of Nature, someone has been here before and put it to use.  A mossy opening is here.

The carcass of the Druid's hut glows a deep red from the fire that consumed it. The small glade is littered with bodies of lupines and orks. Smoke snakes up from the ash, flowing through the hole in the forest room. The trees stand in silence, untouched by the flames.

Recently turned dirt sits against the huge total poles, which dominate the small copse. The sky can barely be seen between the branches of the trees, which define the edge of the clearing.

The path of four leaf clove shaped flagstones leads past a small clean shack and into a well formed tunnel through the thorn bushes to the east and the Caersech to the west. The small shack is set back from the road, its walls built of a whitewashed birch. A sturdy corral, filled with well-fed horses, stands to the left of the shack. A matched pair of dapple grays stand in front of the shack waiting to take their human baggage to their destination. To the left of the door, behind a small paned window, a beautiful Fir Elf female takes coin and in return, with a charming smile, directs those who have paid their fare into the waiting room.  A small shack, a freshly painted sign, a notice of non-refund, and a small winding stone pathway are here.

Carefully winding its way up the base of the tree, and wrapping itself around the stairs, a flowering jasmine vine grows tall and lush. Dark scars from a past fire are almost hidden under tufts of fresh growth and moss. A large gap, nearly sixteen feet in distance, rests between the base of a set of stairs and the forest floor. A long moonsilver cord hangs down the side of the tree. If one pulls it, the long Elven rope will descend from above, allowing them to enter the great city of Treehaven. Bright green leaves of clover have begun springing up through the ashy soil in conjunction with soft moss to lend a durable cushion to this well-traveled spot.  Some vine-covered steps circling the tree, a freshly painted wooden sign, a healthy green patch of clover, a flowing marble fountain, some clover shaped stones, some sweet scented flowering jasmine vines, and a long woven moonsilver cord are here.

A large pile of Elven rope sits near the silent Golem. This creature of Elindale helps defend the city by retrieving the rope that people have pushed down to the forest below.

Four sturdy walls and a roof of woven branches enclose this small tavern. From the forest floor, winding their way around the trunk of the Mother Tree, a set of intricately railed steps serve as the entrance and exit of the town of Treehaven. Strangers arriving at the top of the steps find themselves under the watchful eye of patrons seated at tables positioned about the light, airy room. A set of oak steps lead up to the new Council chambers.  An ivory inlaid pine bar, a wooden stool, a long weathered wooden bench, a long musty wooden table, some steps circling the tree, some freshly crafted oak steps, an open door, a paper covered posting board, a gilt framed painting on the wall, and an open large straw basket are here.

Firm wooden planks fit snuggly to create the walkway that extends proudly upon the reconstructed supports. The view of the forest to the northwest is quite panoramic. A staircase here seems to have some enchantment, judging by the strange appearance of unicorns, bears and owls on the lower steps. Strange, due to the fact that they don't appear carved, painted, or placed by any hand-made means. It is as if the glyphs grew into the wood itself. Mysterious symbols are scattered throughout the portraits, which shimmer with a golden whisper as they are approached.

Some glowing magickal symbols and a brown oak staircase are here.

Firm wooden planks fit snuggly to create the walkway that extends proudly upon the reconstructed supports. The view of the forest to the northwest is quite panoramic. A staircase here seems to have some enchantment, judging by the strange appearance of unicorns, bears and owls on the lower steps. Strange, due to the fact that they don't appear carved, painted, or placed by any hand-made means. It is as if the glyphs grew into the wood itself. Mysterious symbols are scattered throughout the portraits, which shimmer with a golden whisper as they are approached.

Leaves and small twigs spot the walkway as it hugs against the trunk of the Mother Tree. New sprouts from the branches above hang softly over the wooden planks, shading it slightly. A large building rests gently against the trunk in the limbs above, nestled as though it grew from within the tree itself.  An oak ladder is here.

The branches of this tree have begun to grow through the wooden platform. The limbs have begun to twist and turn, forming their own natural base. Soft leaves create a cushion and boast several small buds. The empty remains of an abandoned building is just barely visible between the branches, buried in vines and moss. Intricately crafted stairs lead from the platform to the building that resides in the upper branches.  An open door, some finely crafted wooden stairs, and a painted wooden sign are here.

[Gaspar's Grog and Grub.]

Four sturdy walls and a roof of woven branches enclose this small tavern. From the forest floor, winding their way around the trunk of the Mother Tree, a set of intricately railed steps serve as the entrance and exit of the town of Treehaven. Strangers arriving at the top of the steps find themselves under the watchful eye of patrons seated at tables positioned about the light, airy room. A set of oak steps lead up to the new Council chambers.  An ivory inlaid pine bar, a wooden stool, a long weathered wooden bench, a long musty wooden table, some steps circling the tree, some freshly crafted oak steps, an open door, a paper covered posting board, a gilt framed painting on the wall, and an open large straw basket are here.

The latticework surrounding and covering the spiral staircase is finely crafted. The intertwining beams seem to weave a delicate pattern above you, accenting the view of the forest floor. Soft, new, growth can be seen all over the forest below. A small mound of moss has slowly begun to cover the old inn, creating a fuzzy green mound. A large pile of Elven rope sits near the silent Golem. This creature of Elindale helps defend the city by retrieving the rope that people have pushed down to the forest below.  Some steps circling the tree and a freshly carved wooden sign are here.

Carefully winding its way up the base of the tree, and wrapping itself around the stairs, a flowering jasmine vine grows tall and lush. Dark scars from a past fire are almost hidden under tufts of fresh growth and moss. A large gap, nearly sixteen feet in distance, rests between the base of a set of stairs and the forest floor. A long moonsilver cord hangs down the side of the tree. If one pulls it, the long Elven rope will descend from above, allowing them to enter the great city of Treehaven. Bright green leaves of clover have begun springing up through the ashy soil in conjunction with soft moss to lend a durable cushion to this well-traveled spot.  Some vine-covered steps circling the tree, a freshly painted wooden sign, a healthy green patch of clover, a flowing marble fountain, some clover shaped stones, some sweet scented flowering jasmine vines, a long woven moonsilver cord, and an Elven rope are here.

The path of four leaf clove shaped flagstones leads past a small clean shack and into a well formed tunnel through the thorn bushes to the east and the Caersech to the west. The small shack is set back from the road, its walls built of a whitewashed birch. A sturdy corral, filled with well-fed horses, stands to the left of the shack. A matched pair of dapple grays stand in front of the shack waiting to take their human baggage to their destination. To the left of the door, behind a small paned window, a beautiful Fir Elf female takes coin and in return, with a charming smile, directs those who have paid their fare into the waiting room.  A small shack, a freshly painted sign, a notice of non-refund, and a small winding stone pathway are here.

A small path, its stones in the shape of four leaf clovers, winds its way through the sparse remains of a once dense undergrowth. New plants and flowers begin to rise from the blackened floor, bringing a new color and life to the area.  A small winding stone pathway and a mossy cracked steelwood tree are here.

Recently turned dirt sits against the huge total poles, which dominate the small copse. The sky can barely be seen between the branches of the trees, which define the edge of the clearing. Much of the grass has been trampled into the loose soil of the earth.  A blackened fallen steelwood tree, a blackened fallen steelwood tree, and a tall carved wolf's head totem pole are here.

The carcass of the Druid's hut glows a deep red from the fire that consumed it. The small glade is littered with bodies of lupines and orks. Smoke snakes up from the ash, flowing through the hole in the forest room. The trees stand in silence, untouched by the flames.  A large covered gravestone, a fresh bloody ork corpse, a fresh bloody ork corpse, and a fresh bloody lupine corpse are here.

Smoldering posts and burn wood is all that remains of the building that was here. Ash fills the area, making breathing difficult.  A large hole in the ground sits beneath the only corner of the structure still standing.  An opening and a freshly cut path are here.

The spongy, algae-covered bottom of this dank chamber houses several species of strange fungi, filling the air with an overpowering, moldy stench. Thick mosses have wound their way up the smooth rock walls, leaving very few areas where the stone remains uncovered. Upon the exposed spots of the rock walls, faded etched patterns of knotwork designs lie, signifying that while the cavern itself may be a natural work of Nature, someone has been here before and put it to use.  A mossy opening is here.

Several simple iron sconces line the moss covered walls of this narrow passageway, long since snuffed out. Portruding slightly from the smooth rock on either side of the chamber are several rows of stone slabs, each labeled in etchings that time has rendered indescernible. At the northeastern end of the chamber, a slab is missing, leaving a deep, square hole in the cavern wall. A slight chilled breeze whisps its way about the chamber and lingers near the exposed indention.  A deep square hole in the wall, a miniature snarling coral tiger medallion, and a crude hand-carved ebony snake figurine are here.

A cracked mosaic of colored tiles decorates the western wall of this cavern; thick moss threatening to overcome its stark, haunting beauty. The mosiac itself depicts a scene of Firian mourners gathered within a felled city, the bodies of their brethren piled amongst the scorched landscape. A tarnished bronze plaque has been set in the lower right corner of the mosaic, etched in an ancient Firian dialect. A bitter breeze blows in from the south, and it brings with it the faint sound of a child's cry.  A tarnished bronze plaque, a closed muddy iron coffer, and an ugly green troll mask are here.

The ceiling slopes upward and the cavern opens up considerably, allowing more room to breathe and move around than in the other chambers. Resting upon the center of the algae-laden floor is a sarcophagus that has been heavily decorated and seemingly enshrined. Stone columns to either side of the huge marble coffin have been etched to depict the scene of a peaceful harvest. For some reason, it doesn't seem that the peacefulness expressed in the columns has made its way into this darkened crypt.  A closed ivy etched marble sarcophagus and a pair of spiraling sculpted stone columns are here.

Several simple iron sconces line the moss covered walls of this narrow passageway, long since snuffed out. Portruding slightly from the smooth rock on either side of the chamber are several rows of stone slabs, each labeled in etchings that time has rendered indescernible. At the northeastern end of the chamber, a slab is missing, leaving a deep, square hole in the cavern wall. A slight chilled breeze whisps its way about the chamber and lingers near the exposed indention.  A deep square hole in the wall, a miniature snarling coral tiger medallion, and a crude hand-carved ebony snake figurine are here.

The spongy, algae-covered bottom of this dank chamber houses several species of strange fungi, filling the air with an overpowering, moldy stench. Thick mosses have wound their way up the smooth rock walls, leaving very few areas where the stone remains uncovered. Upon the exposed spots of the rock walls, faded etched patterns of knotwork designs lie, signifying that while the cavern itself may be a natural work of Nature, someone has been here before and put it to use.  A mossy opening is here.

A cracked mosaic of colored tiles decorates the western wall of this cavern; thick moss threatening to overcome its stark, haunting beauty. The mosiac itself depicts a scene of Firian mourners gathered within a felled city, the bodies of their brethren piled amongst the scorched landscape. A tarnished bronze plaque has been set in the lower right corner of the mosaic, etched in an ancient Firian dialect. A bitter breeze blows in from the south, and it brings with it the faint sound of a child's cry.  A tarnished bronze plaque and an ugly green troll mask are here.

The spongy, algae-covered bottom of this dank chamber houses several species of strange fungi, filling the air with an overpowering, moldy stench. Thick mosses have wound their way up the smooth rock walls, leaving very few areas where the stone remains uncovered. Upon the exposed spots of the rock walls, faded etched patterns of knotwork designs lie, signifying that while the cavern itself may be a natural work of Nature, someone has been here before and put it to use.  A mossy opening is here.

A cracked mosaic of colored tiles decorates the western wall of this cavern; thick moss threatening to overcome its stark, haunting beauty. The mosiac itself depicts a scene of Firian mourners gathered within a felled city, the bodies of their brethren piled amongst the scorched landscape. A tarnished bronze plaque has been set in the lower right corner of the mosaic, etched in an ancient Firian dialect. A bitter breeze blows in from the south, and it brings with it the faint sound of a child's cry.  A tarnished bronze plaque is here.

Several simple iron sconces line the moss covered walls of this narrow passageway, long since snuffed out. Portruding slightly from the smooth rock on either side of the chamber are several rows of stone slabs, each labeled in etchings that time has rendered indescernible. At the northeastern end of the chamber, a slab is missing, leaving a deep, square hole in the cavern wall. A slight chilled breeze whisps its way about the chamber and lingers near the exposed indention.  A deep square hole in the wall, a miniature snarling coral tiger medallion, and a crude hand-carved ebony snake figurine are here.

A cracked mosaic of colored tiles decorates the western wall of this cavern; thick moss threatening to overcome its stark, haunting beauty. The mosiac itself depicts a scene of Firian mourners gathered within a felled city, the bodies of their brethren piled amongst the scorched landscape. A tarnished bronze plaque has been set in the lower right corner of the mosaic, etched in an ancient Firian dialect. A bitter breeze blows in from the south, and it brings with it the faint sound of a child's cry.  A tarnished bronze plaque is here.

Several simple iron sconces line the moss covered walls of this narrow passageway, long since snuffed out. Portruding slightly from the smooth rock on either side of the chamber are several rows of stone slabs, each labeled in etchings that time has rendered indescernible. At the northeastern end of the chamber, a slab is missing, leaving a deep, square hole in the cavern wall. A slight chilled breeze whisps its way about the chamber and lingers near the exposed indention.  A deep square hole in the wall, a miniature snarling coral tiger medallion, and a crude hand-carved ebony snake figurine are here.

Several simple iron sconces line the moss covered walls of this narrow passageway, long since snuffed out. Portruding slightly from the smooth rock on either side of the chamber are several rows of stone slabs, each labeled in etchings that time has rendered indescernible. At the northeastern end of the chamber, a slab is missing, leaving a deep, square hole in the cavern wall. A slight chilled breeze whisps its way about the chamber and lingers near the exposed indention.  A deep square hole in the wall, a miniature snarling coral tiger medallion, and a crude hand-carved ebony snake figurine are here.

Several simple iron sconces line the moss covered walls of this narrow passageway, long since snuffed out. Portruding slightly from the smooth rock on either side of the chamber are several rows of stone slabs, each labeled in etchings that time has rendered indescernible. At the northeastern end of the chamber, a slab is missing, leaving a deep, square hole in the cavern wall. A slight chilled breeze whisps its way about the chamber and lingers near the exposed indention.  A deep square hole in the wall, a miniature snarling coral tiger medallion, and a crude hand-carved ebony snake figurine are here.

[Under the Caersech.]

The spongy, algae-covered bottom of this dank chamber houses several species of strange fungi, filling the air with an overpowering, moldy stench. Thick mosses have wound their way up the smooth rock walls, leaving very few areas where the stone remains uncovered. Upon the exposed spots of the rock walls, faded etched patterns of knotwork designs lie, signifying that while the cavern itself may be a natural work of Nature, someone has been here before and put it to use.  A mossy opening is here.

The carcass of the Druid's hut glows a deep red from the fire that consumed it. The small glade is littered with bodies of lupines and orks. Smoke snakes up from the ash, flowing through the hole in the forest room. The trees stand in silence, untouched by the flames.  A large covered gravestone, a fresh bloody ork corpse, a fresh bloody ork corpse, and a fresh bloody lupine corpse are here.

Recently turned dirt sits against the huge total poles, which dominate the small copse. The sky can barely be seen between the branches of the trees, which define the edge of the clearing. Much of the grass has been trampled into the loose soil of the earth.  A blackened fallen steelwood tree, a blackened fallen steelwood tree, and a tall carved wolf's head totem pole are here.
