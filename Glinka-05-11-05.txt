The worn merchants road travels the southern side of a low hill in one wide arc. The broad path is slightly banked to accomodate for the turn and incline. On the exposed side of the road, the sturdy road-bed is exposed to the elements and yet has remained solid. A neatly kept plank house with a stone well and fenced paddock overlooks grain fields to the southeast.

Broadening to fill the lee of a wide valley, the roadway passes by several temporary campsites where caravans have bolstered the existing comforts for their temporary encampments. Neat stacks of foraged sticks and axe-hewn firewood sit adjacent to the blackened rocks of two impromptu fire rings. Freshly dug midden pits waft clues to the camp's frequent use into the clean mountain air.

Empty wooden crates, broken harnesses, damaged pottery, and the usual byproducts of food preparation fill an impromptu refuse pile adjacent to two campsites. Both two and four legged scavengers ply through the pile, scattering it further and enlarging the boundary. The result is a landmark of incongruous shapes, colors and shadows along the otherwise bland sweep of grasslands through which the roadway travels.

Just to the north, the roadway curves gently around a bend in a large river that flows towards the southeast. An enormous smooth round rock splits off a small eddy from the main current resulting a deep, clear pool by the eastern side of the road. The cool calm water catches the reflection of the white snowcapped mountain range further up the valley while the river rushes past towards Spur. Five fishermen recline on folding chairs or against rocks, tethered by the silvery lines of their poles to the fishing hole. Each fisherman is spread evenly around the pool as if held apart by some invisible barrier as they eye the large shadowy fish shapes finning effortlessly against the mild current in the eddy.

The raging silver-cast river cuts through the grassland and heads southeast. Fishing boats, bearing the crest of the city of Spur, dart around several barges laden with exotic wares to trade in the merchant city. Most bear the purple livery of the city of Rathan, but every so often a ship flying unfamiliar colors can be sighted.

The metal grey river deposits a sandbar on its western bank near the merchant road, causing a snag of dead logs, branches and floating debris. A cat sized rodent, with long teeth, flat tail and webbed toes peaks briefly over the jumbled tangle of branches before dipping back into the frigid water without a splash.

Built to withstand the constant flooding of the large river, the roadbed here was constructed 3 feet higher then the rest of the valley floor. The competant engineers extended the berm further northwest until it became the footings of a stalwart rock bridge.

The massive stone bridge expands over the raging river, it's huge pilons buried deep in the river's bottom. Within sight and just downstream, the water rushes past what remains of the old bridge, causing dangerous under-currents. Bright red bouys mark the broken fragments locations and signs tell of the peril. The river pilots earn their pay negotiating this treacherous obstacle.

The huge stone bridge span was built tall to allow the various merchant ships to pass underneath. This amazing height affords a splendid view of the countryside: from the blur of smoky residential air to the southeast, across the verdant grasslands that cover the foothills, to the majestic peaks of the mountain range to the north.

The river surges strongly below the stone span. Even from this height, the noise of the flowing water is near deafening. Two small fishing boats nearly collide as they try to tack between the same set of supports. Only skillful sailing prevents them from hitting each other, or the supports.

Mismatched mortar colors and varying types and cuts of the stone show the extent of the reconstruction made by quick working masons. A few proud workers chiseled their initials and the date into their handiwork, most reading the date of Rinannimas, 6th month, 61st day, year 313. Bright banners flutter in the breeze on both sides of the bridge as if in celebration of its victory over both the river's truculence and sabotage.

A massive stone bridge spans a raging grey tinted river as it runs it's course towards the southeast. The mud around the bridge footings has been churned by wheels of quarry wagons, tracks of sleds bearing block and tackle, shod hooves of draft beasts and booted feet of masons and bridge workers. The newer parts of the huge bridge are obvious due to the contrast in colors of mortar and rock. Bright banners snap briskly in the wind from both ends of the bridge.  A broken wooden wagon is here.

Withstanding seasonal floods and constant traffic, the durable road shows how affective good design and competent construction can be. It travels a hand paved berm straight to an imposing grey stone bridge to the southeast. The pilons of the bridge are cloaked in river mist as the raging river sweeps by. Only the brightness of the fluttering flags that top the spans stand out sharply.

A brown and white osprey soars above the raging river, scanning the water for a meal. Suddenly, it dives down to the surface and snatches a rather large trout from the water. The trout wriggles helplessly in the large birds grip as it is carried off to a nest of sticks and twigs high in the distant treetops.

On the northern edge of the road stands a tall, flat rock. Chipped into the shape of a pillar and abraded to smoothness, it bears the stamped surveyor's mark of the road's builder. The mark's grooved letters are filled with sand and dust and obscured from age, but the arrows delineating north, south, east and west are clear and easy to read. The rest of the stamp is undecipherable and lends mystery to the road's origin.

Boulders stacked in pyramids contained by large timbers stand mutely to the side of the roadway next to an impromptu dump of broken tools, wooden stakes and empty buckets lined with mortar. Deeply grooved sled tracks lead to the east towards the bridge from this part of the road where the flatness of the valley was best suited for the staging area during the bridge's reconstruction. Smooth rectangles of tent foundations still mark their location in a semi circle around a blackened fire ring where the workers and their supervisors lived during it's rebuilding.

The decaying remains of the bridge workers camp sprawls across this flat valley. To house their draft beasts, the workers constructed small stalls and shelters from rickety boards nailed quixotically to the standing trees. Three brass ring topped posts lie sunk into the grasslands turf, to the south, which was most likely used for tethering grazing animals. Between the posts is a rough stone trough that is filled automatically with water by a rickety mechanical wind mill, whirling lazily in the breeze.

Water loving trees hug the river's course through the low lying valley. Giant beech and huge alders vie for the valuable sodden shoreline and shade the understory bushes and ferns from direct sunlight. The result is a lushly green, verdant forest that obscures the river from the view on the road, though the hiss of rushing water reveals it's course.

Running parallel to the road is a smooth rock lined trench that channels the road's run-off during rainstorms. This flat part of the road that follows the valley floor would be prone to turn into a muddy bog and therefore a hazard to most caravans and their pack animals. Anticipating this event, the road's engineers built drains into the lower side of the road that carry the runoff into the culvert, which carries it harmlessly down to the low end of the valley.

With the care and attention to detail rarely given to a mundane project such as a road, the engineers foresaw potential hazards and built the solutions into their finished project. Tracking the southern, downhill side of the road is a stone lined trough meant to solve any flooding or mud related issues.

The merchant road passes through a small secluded valley. The soft cadence of rushing water echoes quietly down the vale where the rolling hills of the grasslands meets the sharper cliffs of the foothills. Riverlets and streams trickle down the rock faces adding harmony to a distant river's melody.

The road crests the top of hill overlooking the sweeping grasslands of the river valley. A smokey smudge on the southeastern horizon reveals the location of a large city and the merchant road appears here and there between trees and hills as it travels to market. The roar of the great river drones in the distance.

White barked birch trees populate the moist valleys that drain into the river to the southeast as the merchant road passes nearby. The tall vertical trees reach to the sky in a beautiful dance reminiscent of dancers waving their arms gracefully to some unheard rhythm. The grain-laden grasses sway in accompaniment, and the tinkling waterfalls and babbling creeks beat like odd syncopated patterns onto the rocks.

The roadway takes advantage of a cut in the hill to negotiate a tumbled cliff face. At the top of the hill is a high, flat, steppe grassland, and at the bottom is the edge of the open range. At one point, the road narrows to cross a small stream. Very little mud gathers in the shallows of the stream and the pebbles and rocks glitter like gold as the wagon wheels churn the gravel.

The merchant roads widens as it travels another grass swept plateau. The mountain range fills the northern skyline in stark detail. Huge snow capped peaks and rough faced cliffs are close enough to see the individual boulders, waterfalls, and haphazard game trails. Much higher up the great mountainsides a line where trees stop growing gives testament to the altitude. The air is cool.

The grassland plateau is embraced by a stand of dark green oak trees so thick that little light passes through the profusion of their many lobed leaves. The forest is ancient and the trunks of the trees bare witness to fires, lightning strikes and the attacks of insects. Large gout-like burls disfigure some of the wide, grey trunks which have grown quietly next to the road for hundreds of years.

Crunching loudly on the road is a ankle high deposit of acorn hulls and their discarded caps. Quick footed grey squirrels dash across the road, or above on the high intertwined branches of the stately oaks, with the highly coveted acorns grasped firmly in their teeth. The squirrels flash their tails at each other in some unknown signal as traffic passes on the road.  A pile of empty acorn caps is here.

The merchant road makes a wide turn as it passes through the thick oak forest. A tiny meadow with a murmuring creek is the only open spot in sight. Bright wildflowers and fragrant mosses crowd around a sparkling jewel of a pond while the huge oaks stand like sentinels around the edges. A spotted fawn and its doe-eyed mother drink cautiously, swishing their white edged tails quickly.

The merchant road follows a bumpy path through the oak forest. Each stately old tree has added a few feet to it's girth since the road was first surveyed and constructed hundreds of years ago. Their roots have plied across the road, upending it's hand laid foundation and hand pounded bed. Several large knees of the oak's roots have leveraged up the edges of the road, hindering all wagons' passage and threatening to break spokes and axles.

Off to the side of the road, perhaps a hundred feet away, stands an enormous tree that commands the attention of all who pass this direction. It's offspring populate the plateau for miles in both directions. At one time, the tree must have stood alone on the prairie soil and dropped acorns year after year until one tree became a huge forest of oaks.

The merchant road takes a large bend as it travels through the dark woodland. Venerable, wide-trunked oaks line the merchant road and the trunks of the closest ones have been marked by the passage of thousands of travelers and adventurers. Some have carved their initials, some, a picture of loved ones or body parts of odd proportions, and some, the date they passed by.

The high steppe grasslands yields to a green wall of oak trees to the southeast. The oak forest is very old, the greying trunks of the behemoths are cracked and split. The road immediately darkens under the canopy of the green leaves. Pale green bracken ferns grow tall in the eternal twilight shade. Flat, yellow capped mushrooms and rippled shelf fungi sprout from the fallen trees. The pleasant aroma of healthy decomposing leaves fills the air.

Hand pounded concrete pipes, half circle in shape, channel two small streams under the chinked rock and gravel road-bed. The icy spring water bubbles down the hill and glides over a sheet of shorn granite until it fills a crystal clear pool at the bottom, far below the road. The pool's overflow creates a single clear stream that meanders towards the ancient oak forest.

Dead fall and broken branches cover the hollow and is home for a family of thick furred marmots. The dark brown colored rodents stare out of the dark recesses of the dead branches with shiny black eyes. A brace of buck-toothed, adolescent marmots scramble for cover as the shrill cry of a hawk sounds further up the mountain.

Thicker stalked grasses grow here on this high plateau where the air is rarified and rain spills quickly down the small rocky gullies. A few staunch oaks grow alone or in groups of one or two, their roots exposed where they cling to the rocky soil for sustenance. Thin, scraggly junipers suck up what little moisture the soil does manage to hold. The merchant road placidly passes by, untouched by time in the dry environment.

Bright green trees and healthy bushes stand out sporadically on the dusty steppe. The little spring fed islands are surrounded by the blue-green grasses that thrive here. All manner of beasts are drawn to the springs and the protection they offer. Bright blue scrub jays chatter noisily among themselves as they dart and swerve in accomplished aerial feats pursuing their winged insect meals. A small herd of wary jackrabbits stop munching the grass to turn their white ears towards the merchant road. The nearest jack to the road stands on his hind legs and tests the air for any scent of their many predators.

Blending perfectly with the muted hues of the arid surroundings, a lone timber wolf stalks the outer edges of the grassland about a half a mile from the merchant road. The wolf's ears are perked to listen for the rustling of the bushy tailed jack rabbits that thrive in the prairie. The wolf lifts it nose to catch a scent, howls briefly and trots off towards the southeast to catch it's prey from downwind.

A brisk wind barrels down from the mountains to the north, its touch filled with the promise of ice and snow. As it passes the dry road-bed, it mixes with the warm moist air of the river valley that creeps north and causes dust dervishes that spin their opaque bodies thousands of feet into the air.

The choice to remove hundreds of feet of hillside was more prudent to the road engineers then a long series of switch-backs that would have to climb the steep hillside for hundreds of feet. Tube shaped holes drilled into the bedrock still remain from when the roadbed was blasted eons ago.

A solid brass smelted road marker was made to fit perfectly into a cylinder carved in a large boulder. The boulder is pure white crystal quartz, fractured and broken into beautiful prisms around the edges, but remains whole and pure in the center. The road marker clearly points out the cardinal directions using four arrows.   A solid brass road marker is here.

Protected by an outcropping of the rocks that tops another high hill, an oasis of vibrant green mosses reveal a small spring that barely dampens the rocky soil. An industrious and thirsty traveler has coaxed the tricklet of water through a small trench that slowly fills a shallow stone basin. The granite basin holds only enough water to fill a few waterbags.

The jagged mountains and snow capped peaks cannot be viewed along this portion of the merchant road, due to the proximity of the range.  Deep valleys and steep hillsides further hinder any vantage points other then straight ahead and behind.  For all intents and purposes, the mountains do not exist in this passage through the rippled land.

The merchant road dips down into a small valley with steep walls, cutting across the incline like a switch-back to reduce the grade.  This long but narrow canyon is tree-less and full of gravel and broken rocks. As if to emphasize the strangeness of the sheered rocks, a line of split stone expands across the very center of the valley.

The sandy soil of the steppe has been ripped away to reveal its intimate underpinnings.  The matted roots of the prairie grasses desperately hold into what little dirt they can while below in wide layers, the rocks and dirt tell the story of the plateau and the surrounding foothills. Each striation varies in texture, composition and color. They are an open book for those with the specific knowledge to read it.

The merchant road threads through bottom of the small, narrow valley. Sheer granite walls block the view from the well traveled road to either side and above, only a narrow ray of sky testifies to the time of day. The engineers set a route as far as possible from the broken stones in the center of the valley and, by luck or design, this foresight has saved the road-bed from constant reconstruction. Small cracks run parallel to the road, but none have broken through the thick layers of sand and stone.

One layer of rock in the steep walls has eroded faster then the harder granite or bedrock above and below it. Soft sandstone has been stripped away to form an arch in the valley wall ... a concave indention that goes for hundreds of feet in both directions.  Within the hardened sediment left ages ago upon the land are treasures beyond value: fossilized shells by the thousands, in all sizes, shapes and colors.

The momentous forces that have wrought this valley still press upon the land and have done so for eons.  The walls of the valley are sheer and steep, and untouched by the raging waters of river or stream.  As if in testimony to the power of the forces that move the land, a huge dark boulder sits off to the side of the road. It is hewn in half like a sliced melon.  One part sits 20 feet north along the break in the rocks from the other part.

Sheer, monolithic cliffs dropping for thousands of feet front the western edge of the mountains; their sharp, snow-capped peaks vaulting nearly vertically from the floor of the fault line valley.

As the merchant road approaches the western end of the valley, the valley wall abruptly falls away to a sheer drop. Crumbling rock and dirt spill constantly into the deep abyss. Sections of the mountain have slid away into the valley and the merchant road has been rebuilt higher along the steeper sides of the mountain. The fault line of broken rocks continues its path of destruction to the west, skirted by the land-slide prone softer dirt.   A freshly uncovered crevice is here.

A treacherous dusty trail leads west along the shaky fault line from a fork in the main road. The original roadbed has fallen into the chasm years ago, leaving the merchants to their own wiles to ply the slippery slopes past the fault zone. Many attempts have failed at conquering the shifting dirt and rocks. Currently a bumpy trail skirts the bigger rocks and loose gravel.

The old merchant road lies in pieces at the bottom of a deep gorge far below. An artificial pathway has been constructed in the wake of the recent collapse, allowing continued passage through the mountains. This new merchant road has been constructed in great haste and is still quite unstable. Gravel that has been spread on the road to make it safer, is actually making it far more precarious. Pebbles roll continuously off of the roads surface and down into the chasm below.

The road ascends upward at a rather severe angle towards the northwest combined with the shifting road surface, it makes this particular passage very difficult for any merchants traveling with a large quantity of goods. A swiftly flowing river is visible several hundred feet below, and it can only be assumed that it was the cause of the collapse of old merchant road. The audible roar of the river is evident, even this far above.

A lone carrion bird seems to stare from the branches of a gnarled old tree. The road surface alternates between the usual hard-packed dirt covered in gravel, and solid rock. The terrain creates even more difficult travel for those heading north or south. A large pile of broken wagons, barrels, and boxes lie quite some distance below. Many skeletons of pack animals, picked clean by carrion birds, are also discernible. It is highly likely some of the bones are Humanoid as well.

Just to the south is the juncture where old merchant road connected to this new road. Just beyond that is the deep gorge that has swallowed up the old road. The road surface is a stable solid rock, but is barely large enough for a single wagon to pass through. Unlike the new merchant road to the southwest, this road follows a more natural flow up the eastern cliffside carefully traversing the steep mountain. A single yellow wildflower grows defiantly out of the rocky cliff, giving a stark contrast to the solid grey that surrounds it.  A small yellow wildflower is here.

Despite the fact the cliffs to the north are nearly vertical, various plants still cling to life against them. Many are common weeds or merely grasses, but some are delicate wildflowers, leaving little or no explanation as to their presence on the cliff. One small tree is also attempting to take root along the cliffside, its branches jutting out at odd angles.  An oddly shaped rosewood tree is here.

Small shapes are visible scurrying about among the grasses and shrubs, most of them reacting to any movement on the road. A few are visible up the road ahead, but quickly vanish at the distant screech of a raptor. It is a few moments before they curiously return.  Some small cute striped chipmunks are here.

The poor construction of this road becomes quickly evident. Water is flowing down over the sides of the cliff above and across the road surface. Due to the slight slope of the road toward the deep chasm to the south, this section of road is quite hazardous. Many broken pieces of rope and metal spikes are strewn all over the pathway; evidently failed attempts to keep wagons from sliding over the side. Large piles of heavy looking stones have now been stacked along the edge of the gorge in hopes it will prevent trade carts from careening off the edge. Several of these stones seem to be missing. Evidently the idea is not working as well as was hoped.  A large pile of stones and a large pile of stones are here.

A large pile of unexplained wooden crates and barrels have been tossed unceremoniously in an alcove off the side of the main road. They have all been scavenged long ago and simply lie abandoned by their owners. For hundreds of feet in either direction, the road surface is covered in deep grooves, making wagon travel quite hazardous. Even at a slow pace the vibrations are intense enough to damage cargo. This is made evident as a heavily laden wagon shudders down the slope. Swearing loudly, the merchant tosses what sounds like a crate full of broken glass into the alcove before continuing onward.  A pile of wooden crates and barrels is here.

A large gap in the roadway is now spanned by a rickety looking wood and rope bridge. The slats seem to be spaced just close enough so that a wagon wheel does not get lodged between them. The remnants of the foundations of an old stone bridge are evident on both sides of this gap. A few hundred feet below the present bridge, the former one is visible in several pieces. Considering the state of the old bridge, this unstable replacement does not exactly inspire feelings of safety.  A decrepit looking wood and rope bridge is here.

There is an extremely large crevasse in the roadway that would normally prevent any further travel along this road. Astoundingly, someone has constructed a very sturdy looking bridge using two perfectly chiseled granite blocks. The blocks make up the support for the bridge structure, which is also constructed of chiseled granite slabs. There is seemingly no explanation for the excellent condition of this stretch of the road.  A sturdy granite bridge is here.

The cliff face to the north is wet, but there is no apparent source of the moisture. A slight overhang also creates a near permanent shadow in the area, providing a perfect atmosphere for the dense lichen that covers the rocks. Sporadic tufts of grass futilely attempt to assert themselves against the multi-colored lichen, but the spongy fungus prevails. Strange looking spiders scurry about amongst the lichen-covered rocks, before disappearing over the top of the cliff.

The road is almost non-existent. The many large granite boulders that cover the path evidence the instability of the mountains to the north and south. The merchants who travel this road have erected a series of shoddy road signs to direct travelers safely around the boulders. Several of these signs point away from a shadowy area just off the side of the road. The rocks of the area seem to hang over the road slightly, blocking out the light. Light colored stringy material is barely visible along the side of the path.  A flimsy wooden sign, a flimsy wooden sign, and a craggy overhang are here.

Closer to the path, the forest begins to thin out and only a few trees have established themselves close to the road. The merchants who made this road did not bother to go around one of the largest, which is situated directly in the middle of the path.  An ancient towering rosewood tree is here.

Although the fissure slopes downward at a severe angle, the terrain is surprisingly smooth and could be navigated even by a goods-loaded wagon.

Ascending gradually to the northwest, the path curves gently along the base of a very large mountain to the north. The terrain is rough, and mostly composed of rock. In fact this particular section of the path seems to be cut into the side of the mountain. Though a gentle breeze is blowing, this area is oddly silent.

This section of the road is all that remains of the former mountain trail. The old pathway is visible to the north, however a large pile of moist earth, dull grey rock, and broken tree trunks has buried it several feet high making further passage impossible. It would seem this area is prone to landslides. A new road has been cut into the terrain to the southwest, heading in the direction of a smaller mountain peak. The old mountain trail is visible as it climbs up the barren mountainside to the north.

The path rises steeply to both the northeast and the west, traveling up the base of two opposing mountain peaks. The smaller peak to the west is far less pronounced than the peak to the northeast. This narrow valley is enclosed on all sides by mountains. Just to the south of the path is a small lake full of what is surely ice cold water. Various small streamlets are visible running down a few of the surrounding snow-capped peaks, ensuring that the icy lake will remain filled.

The road bends to the southwest around a large boulder as it slopes up the side of this mountain. From this vantage point, large imposing jagged peaks of the mountains above Rathan are visible. Each peak is heavily laden with snow, with only small sections of rock visible. A trail, presumably this one, is also visible traveling northward toward the peaks in the distance.

The air is filled with small flecks of falling snow, but none of it looks to be hitting the ground. Small leafless shrubs dominate the landscape, leaving no explanation as to why they all appear to be dead. The main road leads down the mountainside to the east, and up over a crest to the northwest. This spot is approximately halfway up the slope of this cold mountain peak. The merchant road is visible to the east, making its way slowly out of the Tarath Bends.

Old trees lay side by side with the massive boulders of the mountain, intermingling in a terrible landslide. The mountain top has broken off and slid across the eastern road stopping all forms of transportation. It would take years for mortal hands to remove the tons of stone from the original roadway to make it passable once again. Thankfully, nature has changed the landscape for the better, and has opened a gap through the mountain to the north.

Far upward and northwest a massive tower stands near the peak of the mountain. Massive clouds float at its base blocking whatever route to the tower from view. The towers single spire gleams brightly, the silver polished heavily. Not much more can be assertained about the tower from this position.

Another massive boulder, black and melted, blocks any further passage toward the top of the mountain. Thick grey and white clouds hang heavily near the edge of the road, swirling ever so slightly in the breeze. There is no way to continue up the mountain except perhaps by climbing the sheer cliff wall. The clouds pulse slightly and gravitate toward the road surface, the sound of thunder rolling over the area.

[The Silver Strand.]

A ribbon of pure silver stretches out through the billowing clouds toward the peak of the mountain. Each step is like walking on soft carpeting but without any solid underfooting to hold one up. Any movement on the silver strand makes the surface flow like the waves on the ocean, rippling into the distance.

The strand twists and stretches and in some parts is not entirely there. Large holes open and close on its surface but without fail passage over these rifts is made without any problems. Above and surrounding the strand, the billowing clouds make up the walls of a silky tunnel, flickering with light and the sounds of rolling thunder every so often. The tunnel leads east to a solid mountain roadway and west into a blur.

The strand and tunnel end abruptly before you, dispersing in the strong wind that blows down from the mountain. The next steps will have you hundreds of feet above the mountain base, standing on nothing but air, all solid footing gone. Across this long gap, on its otherside, the silver strand and the cloud tunnel begin again, making their way toward the mountain tower.

There is nothing here but the open expanse of sky. A silvery walkway ends quite close to the east, its semi-solid footing welcome to most who cannot fly. Far northeast another part of the strand waits for a traveler to set foot on its surface to continue the journey up the mountain. A strong wind blows down from the mountain peak, attempting to bring the massive drop to the ground quickly and painfully to anyone stupid enough to wander out into the sky.

Nothing but sky and mountains stretch out on all sides. The drop from this height would surely be deadly to anyone. A sliver of silver glints in the distance, rolling slightly within a wall of clouds. To the northeast, as if floating in the sky, a large tower hovers under it's own power. A small white curl of smoke reaches out from the tower towards the small silver path.  Some alabaster upwards leading stairs are here.

A large golem, created from actar and inlaid with silver markings, stands against the wall. Its rough features are more beast-like then anything else. Sharp fangs and a pig-like snout are centered within the round head while large pointed ears sprout from the sides. In the golem's extended palm sits a strange yellow and white piece of metal, its purpose unknown.  A small round applewood buckler is here.

A large golem, created from actar and inlaid with silver markings, stands against the wall. Its rough features are more beast-like then anything else. Sharp fangs and a pig-like snout are centered within the round head while large pointed ears sprout from the sides. In the golem's extended palm sits a strange yellow and white piece of metal, its purpose unknown.

There is but a single entrance gate and one narrow window slit high above the ground noticeable with a first glance. The silver spire hums slightly giving off a beautiful tune.

There is nothing here but the open expanse of sky. A silvery walkway ends quite close to the east, its semi-solid footing welcome to most who cannot fly. Far northeast another part of the strand waits for a traveler to set foot on its surface to continue the journey up the mountain. A strong wind blows down from the mountain peak, attempting to bring the massive drop to the ground quickly and painfully to anyone stupid enough to wander out into the sky.

The strand twists and stretches and in some parts is not entirely there. Large holes open and close on its surface but without fail passage over these rifts is made without any problems. Above and surrounding the strand, the billowing clouds make up the walls of a silky tunnel, flickering with light and the sounds of rolling thunder every so often. The tunnel leads east to a solid mountain roadway and west into a blur.

The giant fortification wall is divided into two main sections by huge doors.  These doors have been made from silver and look as though they could stand even the most fearsome battering ram.

You stand before a granite wall and large double gated doors. The walls are thick and finely crafted, and there seems to be a rather aged look about them.  The Gate is made of massive slabs of silver, while off to the left and right are the fort's impressive walls, able to withstand a rather large invasion or army if need be.

Rough granite walls rise above you to the east and west. The area here is a bit rougher and seems to have been recently mined. Large veins of silver can be seen.

A massive rent opens up between the mountain side heading south. Boulders sit precariously on the mountain side ready to fall to the ground. Many tons of earth have shifted from the face of the mountain to the ground, covering the small growth of forest at its base. The southeastern road is totally blocked with rubble.

Old trees lay side by side with the massive boulders of the mountain, intermingling in a terrible landslide. The mountain top has broken off and slid across the eastern road stopping all forms of transportation. It would take years for mortal hands to remove the tons of stone from the original roadway to make it passable once again. Thankfully, nature has changed the landscape for the better, and has opened a gap through the mountain to the north.

One is constantly on watch, attempting to keep the family safe from harm. At the slightest noise, it scurries back into its hole and out of sight.  An animal made hole is here.

The cliff face to the north is wet, but there is no apparent source of the moisture. A slight overhang also creates a near permanent shadow in the area, providing a perfect atmosphere for the dense lichen that covers the rocks. Sporadic tufts of grass futilely attempt to assert themselves against the multi-colored lichen, but the spongy fungus prevails. Strange looking spiders scurry about amongst the lichen-covered rocks, before disappearing over the top of the cliff.

A large gap in the roadway is now spanned by a rickety looking wood and rope bridge. The slats seem to be spaced just close enough so that a wagon wheel does not get lodged between them. The remnants of the foundations of an old stone bridge are evident on both sides of this gap. A few hundred feet below the present bridge, the former one is visible in several pieces. Considering the state of the old bridge, this unstable replacement does not exactly inspire feelings of safety.  A decrepit looking wood and rope bridge is here.

A large pile of unexplained wooden crates and barrels have been tossed unceremoniously in an alcove off the side of the main road. They have all been scavenged long ago and simply lie abandoned by their owners. For hundreds of feet in either direction, the road surface is covered in deep grooves, making wagon travel quite hazardous. Even at a slow pace the vibrations are intense enough to damage cargo. This is made evident as a heavily laden wagon shudders down the slope. Swearing loudly, the merchant tosses what sounds like a crate full of broken glass into the alcove before continuing onward.  A pile of wooden crates and barrels is here.

The poor construction of this road becomes quickly evident. Water is flowing down over the sides of the cliff above and across the road surface. Due to the slight slope of the road toward the deep chasm to the south, this section of road is quite hazardous. Many broken pieces of rope and metal spikes are strewn all over the pathway; evidently failed attempts to keep wagons from sliding over the side. Large piles of heavy looking stones have now been stacked along the edge of the gorge in hopes it will prevent trade carts from careening off the edge. Several of these stones seem to be missing. Evidently the idea is not working as well as was hoped.  A large pile of stones and a large pile of stones are here.

Two picturesque snow-capped mountain peaks come together in the distance for a lower pass through their forested bases. The white glint of a distant waterfall glistens amongst the green backdrop. The granite road below you continues its precarious trek eastward up the cliffside.

Just to the south is the juncture where old merchant road connected to this new road. Just beyond that is the deep gorge that has swallowed up the old road. The road surface is a stable solid rock, but is barely large enough for a single wagon to pass through. Unlike the new merchant road to the southwest, this road follows a more natural flow up the eastern cliffside carefully traversing the steep mountain. A single yellow wildflower grows defiantly out of the rocky cliff, giving a stark contrast to the solid grey that surrounds it.  A small yellow wildflower is here.

A lone carrion bird seems to stare from the branches of a gnarled old tree. The road surface alternates between the usual hard-packed dirt covered in gravel, and solid rock. The terrain creates even more difficult travel for those heading north or south. A large pile of broken wagons, barrels, and boxes lie quite some distance below. Many skeletons of pack animals, picked clean by carrion birds, are also discernible. It is highly likely some of the bones are Humanoid as well.

The road ascends upward at a rather severe angle towards the northwest combined with the shifting road surface, it makes this particular passage very difficult for any merchants traveling with a large quantity of goods. A swiftly flowing river is visible several hundred feet below, and it can only be assumed that it was the cause of the collapse of old merchant road. The audible roar of the river is evident, even this far above.

The old merchant road lies in pieces at the bottom of a deep gorge far below. An artificial pathway has been constructed in the wake of the recent collapse, allowing continued passage through the mountains. This new merchant road has been constructed in great haste and is still quite unstable. Gravel that has been spread on the road to make it safer, is actually making it far more precarious. Pebbles roll continuously off of the roads surface and down into the chasm below.

A treacherous dusty trail leads west along the shaky fault line from a fork in the main road. The original roadbed has fallen into the chasm years ago, leaving the merchants to their own wiles to ply the slippery slopes past the fault zone. Many attempts have failed at conquering the shifting dirt and rocks. Currently a bumpy trail skirts the bigger rocks and loose gravel.

As the merchant road approaches the western end of the valley, the valley wall abruptly falls away to a sheer drop. Crumbling rock and dirt spill constantly into the deep abyss. Sections of the mountain have slid away into the valley and the merchant road has been rebuilt higher along the steeper sides of the mountain. The fault line of broken rocks continues its path of destruction to the west, skirted by the land-slide prone softer dirt.   A freshly uncovered crevice is here.

A short tremor suddenly rocks the cracked merchant road! A dusty pall sifts into the air from cracks in the ground and the shifting of gravel around the valley.  The tremor rolls through the canyon walls like a ripple, as if it were a linen sheet that was lifted and settled again. Pack animals and travelers alike stop momentarily and then hasten their pace as if to leave the quake behind them.

Sheer, monolithic cliffs dropping for thousands of feet front the western edge of the mountains; their sharp, snow-capped peaks vaulting nearly vertically from the floor of the fault line valley. The merchant road bed is cracked and broken as it negotiates the larger twists and turns.

The momentous forces that have wrought this valley still press upon the land and have done so for eons.  The walls of the valley are sheer and steep, and untouched by the raging waters of river or stream.  As if in testimony to the power of the forces that move the land, a huge dark boulder sits off to the side of the road. It is hewn in half like a sliced melon.  One part sits 20 feet north along the break in the rocks from the other part.

The merchant road threads through bottom of the small, narrow valley. Sheer granite walls block the view from the well traveled road to either side and above, only a narrow ray of sky testifies to the time of day. The engineers set a route as far as possible from the broken stones in the center of the valley and, by luck or design, this foresight has saved the road-bed from constant reconstruction. Small cracks run parallel to the road, but none have broken through the thick layers of sand and stone.

With the care and attention to detail rarely given to a mundane project such as a road, the engineers foresaw potential hazards and built the solutions into their finished project. Tracking the southern, downhill side of the road is a stone lined trough meant to solve any flooding or mud related issues.

Running parallel to the road is a smooth rock lined trench that channels the road's run-off during rainstorms. This flat part of the road that follows the valley floor would be prone to turn into a muddy bog and therefore a hazard to most caravans and their pack animals. Anticipating this event, the road's engineers built drains into the lower side of the road that carry the runoff into the culvert, which carries it harmlessly down to the low end of the valley.

Water loving trees hug the river's course through the low lying valley. Giant beech and huge alders vie for the valuable sodden shoreline and shade the understory bushes and ferns from direct sunlight. The result is a lushly green, verdant forest that obscures the river from the view on the road, though the hiss of rushing water reveals it's course.

The decaying remains of the bridge workers camp sprawls across this flat valley. To house their draft beasts, the workers constructed small stalls and shelters from rickety boards nailed quixotically to the standing trees. Three brass ring topped posts lie sunk into the grasslands turf, to the south, which was most likely used for tethering grazing animals. Between the posts is a rough stone trough that is filled automatically with water by a rickety mechanical wind mill, whirling lazily in the breeze.

Boulders stacked in pyramids contained by large timbers stand mutely to the side of the roadway next to an impromptu dump of broken tools, wooden stakes and empty buckets lined with mortar. Deeply grooved sled tracks lead to the east towards the bridge from this part of the road where the flatness of the valley was best suited for the staging area during the bridge's reconstruction. Smooth rectangles of tent foundations still mark their location in a semi circle around a blackened fire ring where the workers and their supervisors lived during it's rebuilding.

On the northern edge of the road stands a tall, flat rock. Chipped into the shape of a pillar and abraded to smoothness, it bears the stamped surveyor's mark of the road's builder. The mark's grooved letters are filled with sand and dust and obscured from age, but the arrows delineating north, south, east and west are clear and easy to read. The rest of the stamp is undecipherable and lends mystery to the road's origin.

A brown and white osprey soars above the raging river, scanning the water for a meal. Suddenly, it dives down to the surface and snatches a rather large trout from the water. The trout wriggles helplessly in the large birds grip as it is carried off to a nest of sticks and twigs high in the distant treetops.

Withstanding seasonal floods and constant traffic, the durable road shows how affective good design and competent construction can be. It travels a hand paved berm straight to an imposing grey stone bridge to the southeast. The pilons of the bridge are cloaked in river mist as the raging river sweeps by. Only the brightness of the fluttering flags that top the spans stand out sharply.

A massive stone bridge spans a raging grey tinted river as it runs it's course towards the southeast. The mud around the bridge footings has been churned by wheels of quarry wagons, tracks of sleds bearing block and tackle, shod hooves of draft beasts and booted feet of masons and bridge workers. The newer parts of the huge bridge are obvious due to the contrast in colors of mortar and rock. Bright banners snap briskly in the wind from both ends of the bridge.  A broken wooden wagon is here.

Mismatched mortar colors and varying types and cuts of the stone show the extent of the reconstruction made by quick working masons. A few proud workers chiseled their initials and the date into their handiwork, most reading the date of Rinannimas, 6th month, 61st day, year 313. Bright banners flutter in the breeze on both sides of the bridge as if in celebration of its victory over both the river's truculence and sabotage.

The huge stone bridge span was built tall to allow the various merchant ships to pass underneath.

The massive stone bridge expands over the raging river, it's huge pilons buried deep in the river's bottom. Within sight and just downstream, the water rushes past what remains of the old bridge, causing dangerous under-currents. Bright red bouys mark the broken fragments locations and signs tell of the peril. The river pilots earn their pay negotiating this treacherous obstacle.

Just to the north, the roadway curves gently around a bend in a large river that flows towards the southeast. An enormous smooth round rock splits off a small eddy from the main current resulting a deep, clear pool by the eastern side of the road. The cool calm water catches the reflection of the white snowcapped mountain range further up the valley while the river rushes past towards Spur. Five fishermen recline on folding chairs or against rocks, tethered by the silvery lines of their poles to the fishing hole. Each fisherman is spread evenly around the pool as if held apart by some invisible barrier as they eye the large shadowy fish shapes finning effortlessly against the mild current in the eddy.

Empty wooden crates, broken harnesses, damaged pottery, and the usual byproducts of food preparation fill an impromptu refuse pile adjacent to two campsites. Both two and four legged scavengers ply through the pile, scattering it further and enlarging the boundary.

The road charges across a flat valley through waving stalks of grain with coppery tinted seeds. Around the northern edge grows a row of huge cypress trees with trunks that measure eight feet across. Debris from the trees' self-trimming mats the taller grasses into an impenetrable wall. The cypresses produce the necessary windbreak for the field to bear the heavy headed grain.

As the road bends around a curve, ruts left by merchant's wagons cut so deeply into the mud that all wheeled vehicles are forced to follow the set path. Four loaded wagons of a merchants caravan stand idle as one larger than standard wagon skitters along the path. The buckboard's frame groans and strains to keep it inline while the driver attempts to negotiate the turn. Four dark maned, matched mules balk at the noise behind them, and stomp nervously over the deep ruts. The liveried caravan guards attempt to haul the mules forward, further adding to the mules stubborn refusal to move.

The road diverts around a small pool of murky water that lies to the north. A confusion of hoof prints muddies the shoreline where the placid bovines have come to water themselves. The pool is damned by a small hillock which allows no drainage so the pool remains stagnant.

A rickety criss-crossed rough beam fence pens the grazing of black and white cows whose ponderous forms are barely visible through the tall grass on either side of the road. To the north, the soft, undulating grassland floor of the wide valley succumbs to the rolling foothills, which in turn delineates the imposing outline of a vista-spanning mountain range.

[Market Circle.]

An arch between two large buildings connects Market Circle and Market Street. The more reputable shopkeepers do business within the circle, but pay higher taxes for the privilege. The buildings have been built to last, as these merchants are no traveling tinkers. Interlocking stone walkways and colorful plantings span this central area. Despite the number of animals waiting outside the bank for their owners, the area is spotless. Loud chatter in many languages can be heard from the southwest.  A marble archway, an open elegant gold-trimmed walnut door, and a wooden sign are here.

[Market Street.]

Situated between the well-traveled Trade Way to the north and the fine shops of Market Circle to the south, this small stretch of road is busy at all times of day. Adventurers with sacks of plundered goods leave Market Street and head west where a shrewd businessman has set up shop in this busy area of the Market District. A small shop stands slightly to the east of the arch leading into Merchant Circle, light shining through its red glass door and illuminating the store front in a cheerful, ruby glow.  A street lantern, an opaque ruby red glass door, and a gold lettered wooden sign are here.

Obvious paths: north* south* west*.

The buildings of Market Circle stand to the south. It becomes obvious that the area through the arch is a much cleaner marketplace than the bazaar. An inviting eatery stands beside the road, its door open to those weary after a long trip to Spur, as well as those preparing to venture to the great expanses beyond the west gate. A human couple exit the building, arm in arm. A small sign stands beside the intersection.  A sign, an open glossy lacquered oak door, and a street lantern are here.

Many townsfolk pass along this busy thoroughfare. Rich and poor alike mix freely on this street, much to the dismay of a passing nobleman.

A large gate separates the Merchant District and Town Square-the hub of Spur's activity. The partially opened gate is currently able to accommodate the simultaneous passage of several locals and visitors, but can be expanded to accept carriages, or sealed to ward against invasion.  Guards stand sentry from atop the wall as well as the ground.  A street lantern is here.

A neatly kept park fronts this portion of Merchant Walk. Topiary and low shrubberies partition off small sections of the park.

A massive circular stone platform stands to the side of Magick Lane, strangely entrancing runes carved on every inch of its sides. The symbol of the god Sa, a golden Dragon, fills the space along the top. Raw power and magick seem to flow from the platform, making the air around it crackle with energy.

The shop owner looks to know what every one of the runes does.  A large glowing sign, a wooden sign, an intricately carved oak door, and some flaming ruby ashes are here.

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.   A flowing white marble fountain, a marble statue of a Human, a highly polished marble statue of a Dragon, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a giant bunch of yellow and white daffodils, and a rosewood sign are here.

A small shop stands slightly to the east of the arch leading into Merchant Circle, light shining through its red glass door and illuminating the store front in a cheerful, ruby glow.

>[Fredriquede Tiffany's Fine Jewel and Gem Shoppe]

A flashy Drag-al merchant swaggers up to you, introduces himself as Fredriquede Tiffany, and starts loudly praising everything in his shop. You can hardly see his fingers for the oversized rings, and his heavy gold necklaces reveal a taste for the expensive more than the classy, but you have to grudgingly admit that he knows his gems.   An open banded steelwood door is here.

This room is illuminated.
You see the 1st governor's dread knight.
Obvious exits: None.
