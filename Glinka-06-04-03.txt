[Treehaven, Main Platform]

The platform has been swept recently, revealing the new boards that have replaced some of the burned ones.  The remains of the old bank to the south have been completely cleared away, leaving just the shell of the old building there.  Intricately crafted stairs lead from the platform to the new building that resides in the upper branches.  An open door and a freshly painted wooden sign are here.

This area is illuminated.
Obvious paths: northeast* west*.
