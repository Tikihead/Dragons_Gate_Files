The path seems to be disappearing before your very eyes. Travel any way but back to the northwest is blocked by foliage so dense as to prevent any further passage into the forest. An ancient oak tree festooned with bright colorful silk ribbons stands to the side of the disappearing path. Sparkling trinkets and gems hang from every available branch, a  cheerful tinkling noise filling the air with the slightest breeze.  A giant ancient oak tree, a fragrant bluish Secian rose, a tiny oak knothole, some swirling multicolored paper hanging lanterns, and some flowing colorful paper streamers are here.

Large soft silk-covered feather pillows lay scattered about the floor, and a shimmering crystal fountain sits in the center of the chamber. A beautiful mural has been painted on one wall and adds even more color to the room.  A white cloth covered serving tray is filled with delicious summer snacks, including taffy apple salad with miniature marshmallows, baked banana chips with honey yogurt dip, orange and cranberry muffins, and fresh melon and summer berry salad with caramelized walnuts. A second tray is filled with an assortment of fresh juices.  A blue and white silken rope leading up, a tiny oak knothole, a soft blue and white velvet sofa, a soft green silk pillow, a soft red silk pillow, a soft yellow silk pillow, a soft blue silk pillow, a large ribboned wooden drink platter, and a pretty white cloth covered serving tray are here.

Though not obvious at first glance, a game trail does indeed snake its way through the rotting leaves and pine needles that make up the padded forest floor.

With Meetpoint at your heels this rugged old cobblestone bridge leads to the Southern Plains and the main trade routes from spur and Meetpoint to the Southernmost reaches of the lands. Signs that this road was once well traveled by the hustle and bustle of laden carts are plain to view.

Rising up out of the plains, a large walled fort receives the end of the stone road. The river flows from either side, running through the fort from this angle of view. The vegetation surrounding the tradeway at this point has been burned out recently, allowing a clear field of vision from the tops of the walls ahead. The stones show little wear from the heavy traffic of feet and wheels alike; it has certainly been well constructed.

The plains stretch as far as the eyes can see, the horizon and the walls of the fort down the road the only blemishes of the grassy landscape in the distance. The stones of the road are smoothly set together, well built to withstand heavy travel.
