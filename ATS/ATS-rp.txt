Tralisia - Town Center
    Tralisia's plaza is in the shadow of the Glorifian Construct, a large tower made from multi-colored
essence fragments. A white marble fountain, surrounded by a barren garden, is at the base of the structure.
Portions of the plaza are still damaged from the recent battle with Derium and his otherworldly abominations.
