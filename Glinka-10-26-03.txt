[Town Square Center.]

A massive gate dominates the center of Town Square. Monolithic stone imperial dragons stand to each side of the gate like sentinels keeping watch over the city of Spur. Beneath the colossal structure rests a large flowing marble fountain. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a shimmering blue pool. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each one a celebrated hero of Spur's past.  A carved marble statue of a Human, a carved marble statue of a Dragon, a broken brightly painted wooden birdhouse, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a flowing white marble fountain, some glowing intricately carved pumpkins, and some vomit are here.

This area is illuminated.

Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a shimmering blue pool. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each one a celebrated hero of Spur's past.  A carved marble statue of a Human, a carved marble statue of a Dragon, a broken brightly painted wooden birdhouse, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a flowing white marble fountain, some glowing intricately carved pumpkins, and some vomit are here.

[Town Square Center.]

A massive gate dominates the center of Town Square. Monolithic stone imperial dragons stand to each side of the gate like sentinels keeping watch over the city of Spur. Beneath the colossal structure rests a large flowing marble fountain. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a shimmering blue pool. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each one a celebrated hero of Spur's past.  A carved marble statue of a Human, a carved marble statue of a Dragon, a broken brightly painted wooden birdhouse, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a flowing white marble fountain, some glowing intricately carved pumpkins, and some vomit are here.

This area is illuminated.
You see the 1st wolf (wearing a small gold collar) and the 1st mare (wearing a small gold collar).

[Town Square South.]

The outward appearance of the people here seems a bit classier. Rich clothing and large coin purses are prevalent amongst the travelers. In fact, many of the folk heading into Town Square from the south are accompanied by large bodyguards to assure their safety. The well maintained road is lined with small brass lanterns, each swinging off an individual pole. No expense has been spared to keep those who travel this road safe from the hoodlums that relish the darkness.  A street lantern is here.

This area is illuminated.
In the area are Starman the Frontacian, Lebelle the Secian, Equality the Noble Secian, and Tabris the San Elf.

Smooth stones make up the street that leads from the center of Spur to the south. Each stone has been carefully fitted for the most comfortable travel by both cart and traveler alike. A well dressed Guard patrols the area in his dress uniform. Captains don't allow for slovenly appearances on this patrol.  A street lantern is here.

Southern Avenue leads between the center of Spur and the homes of the prosperous and wealthy. Several of the Ladies of the city stroll along the avenue chatting about the current events and latest gossip of the Spur. Behind them, harried servants carry their reticules and all those belongings that they cannot be without.  A street lantern is here.

Vast estates tower over the huge Spurian wall towards the south. The well-to-do who live in these homes idle away their days, enjoying the luxury of time. Standing next to a very empty lantern pole, a small Flerian child insists in a plaintive wail, that he had nothing to do with the missing lantern. The well-dressed guard that interrogates him keeps pointing at a small sack on the ground and its obvious contents.  An open small burlap sack and a street lantern are here.

[Southern Avenue & Gorey Street.]

The boughs of a large apple tree hang over the well tended avenue. Below the beautiful tree stands a small fountain. Atop the fountain is an intricately carved Secian who appears to be dancing with the water as it splashes around her. Set in the marble base is a small plaque that reads, "For those who have gone before us." Many stand for a moment as they pass this way, giving thanks for the gift of life that is given by both the apple tree and the Secians of long ago. Large piles of dirt and broken stone lay on either side of the street as workmen ready the east and west alleys for expansion.  A street lantern and a Secian etched moonsilver door are here.

Standing next to the large iron gate that separates the center of town from those of the elite class are several of the Spurian Guard. They are here to assist all who pass with the simple kindness of opening a gate, or the more important task of escorting those in need to the bank or market. A young looking cadet rubs wax into the stones of the city wall, his task is daunting, but one that will teach him discipline.  An open iron gate and a street lantern are here.

[Gateway.]

An elegant, carved wooden sign hangs above the ornate gateway set into the massive wall that divides Spurs Noble District from the Town Square. You can make out city guardsmen peering down attentively at all that approach from their posts atop the imposing wall. They seem to take a greater interest in this part of town, though there does not seem to be anything threatening enough here to warrant such attention.  A gilded silver plaque and a street lantern are here.

To the north, you can make out an ornately scrolled gateway set in the base of the imposing city wall. The refined roadway of Noble Way stretches out to the south. The cobblestones of the road are smooth and even. The attention to detail shown here is a dramatic change from some of the other parts of the city.  A street lantern is here.

An unusually large home, even for this part of town, lies off to the west. It seems as if one ambitious owner is slowly buying up the lots next to his and adding them to his own. Groundskeepers are at work in the surrounding gardens, trimming and raking, so intent on their work they do not bother to acknowledge the passing traffic on the road.  A street lantern is here.

Many grand, even ostentatious, homes line this stretch of Noble Way. Most of the residents here were fortunate enough to be born into the right families. Few that live in this area have ever actually had to work for a living. Glancing at the nameplates reveals many of the recognizable names of the Spur. Some of these names could almost be considered famous.  A street lantern is here.

Noble Way continues to wind its way among the rather modestly sized, but elegant, homes of the Spur's successful. Many a peasant farmer may live in homes larger than these, but none can match the quality found here. A peaceful, luxurious feeling pervades this part of town; perhaps it is the drifting floral scents wafting from the well-tended gardens.  A closed elegant black iron gate and a street lantern are here.

Gazing down each of the nearby private drives reveals a glimpse of a luxurious home, each a miniature estate in its own right. Short, stout walls and manicured hedges serve to keep out the riffraff and to protect the small, expensive gardens. Every detail has been attended to display the exotic plants, in all their pampered perfection.  A street lantern and a closed rosewood door are here.

[Noble Way.]

Leaving the exceptionally wealthy estates of the Spurian nobility, Noble Way heads toward the Town Square to the northwest. Along the roadside can be seen the in-city homes of successful merchants and other wealthy citizens of the Spur. The homes display a slightly different style, perhaps they are not quite so restrained; a touch more exuberance and freedom with materials is displayed.  A street lantern is here.

The avenue comes to a fork, with Noble Way curving from south to the northwest. A side-street heading off to the east leads to an extremely well kept neighborhood that easily surpasses everything around it in splendor and magnificence. Everything, even the carefully pruned trees and the manicured shrubbery displays a desire for elegant perfection.  A street lantern is here.

The entire avenue is composed of fine cobblestone, each level with its neighbor, providing a smooth ride for passing carriages and horses. The stones were customized by craftsmen, cut to order, rather than simply placed wherever they might fit. A few stately oaks and elms line the sides of the road, shading travelers during the daylight hours.  A street lantern is here.

Numerous trees lining the avenue serve as the dividing border between the majestic estates of the nobility and the lightly traveled roadway. The estates themselves are noticeably closer to the avenue than those to the south. However, they are no easier to access, still protected by their own guarding walls, some covered with ivy or colorful blooming vines.  A street lantern is here.

Occasional gates and driveways lead back into the well-kept estates of the city's nobility, breaking and adding interest to the defining plane of the walls lining Noble Way.

A small roadway bordered by flowering hedges bisects the wide avenue of Noble Way at a right angle, heading east to west.  A thick, sturdy sign stands just off to the side of a charming path, its large friendly letters intent on luring travelers into the city's premiere roadstay, the Gilded Lion Inn. The entrance is clearly marked and welcoming, extending off to the southeast.  A wooden sign and a street lantern are here.

The entire place has an authoritative bearing, suitable for an official residence.  There is a small sign posted off to one side.  A wooden sign and a street lantern are here.

A thick, sturdy sign stands just off to the side of a charming path, its large friendly letters intent on luring travelers into the city's premiere roadstay, the Gilded Lion Inn. The entrance is clearly marked and welcoming, extending off to the southeast.  A wooden sign and a street lantern are here.

Occasional gates and driveways lead back into the well-kept estates of the city's nobility, breaking and adding interest to the defining plane of the walls lining Noble Way.

Numerous trees lining the avenue serve as the dividing border between the majestic estates of the nobility and the lightly traveled roadway. The estates themselves are noticeably closer to the avenue than those to the south. However, they are no easier to access, still protected by their own guarding walls, some covered with ivy or colorful blooming vines.  A street lantern is here.

The entire avenue is composed of fine cobblestone, each level with its neighbor, providing a smooth ride for passing carriages and horses.

Leaving the exceptionally wealthy estates of the Spurian nobility, Noble Way heads toward the Town Square to the northwest. Along the roadside can be seen the in-city homes of successful merchants and other wealthy citizens of the Spur. The homes display a slightly different style, perhaps they are not quite so restrained; a touch more exuberance and freedom with materials is displayed.  A street lantern is here.

Travelers from Rathan to the northwest, and the Trade Route to the south, converge at Spur's west gate. Guards posted on the ground give those seeking to enter the city a cursory once-over. Their lack of interest shows that anyone approaching has already been observed from above for some time. A grate in the ground loosens mud from wagon wheels and hooves before they pass through the gate, helping to keep the streets of Spur fairly clean.  An open giant black iron gate, a giant green oak tree, a small blue pool, a thick oak grate over the pool, a broken frosted carriage, a large shattered drathain jewel chest, a dead noble guard, and a dead noble guard are here.

[Noble Way.]

Noble Way continues to wind its way among the rather modestly sized, but elegant, homes of the Spur's successful. Many a peasant farmer may live in homes larger than these, but none can match the quality found here. A peaceful, luxurious feeling pervades this part of town; perhaps it is the drifting floral scents wafting from the well-tended gardens.  A closed elegant black iron gate and a street lantern are here.

This area is illuminated.
You see the 1st guard, the 2nd guard, the 3rd guard, and the 4th guard.
Obvious paths: north* south*.
[Noble Way.]

Gazing down each of the nearby private drives reveals a glimpse of a luxurious home, each a miniature estate in its own right. Short, stout walls and manicured hedges serve to keep out the riffraff and to protect the small, expensive gardens. Every detail has been attended to display the exotic plants, in all their pampered perfection.  A street lantern and a closed rosewood door are here.

Leaving the exceptionally wealthy estates of the Spurian nobility, Noble Way heads toward the Town Square to the northwest. Along the roadside can be seen the in-city homes of successful merchants and other wealthy citizens of the Spur. The homes display a slightly different style, perhaps they are not quite so restrained; a touch more exuberance and freedom with materials is displayed.  A street lantern is here.

[Intersection.]

The avenue comes to a fork, with Noble Way curving from south to the northwest. A side-street heading off to the east leads to an extremely well kept neighborhood that easily surpasses everything around it in splendor and magnificence. Everything, even the carefully pruned trees and the manicured shrubbery displays a desire for elegant perfection.  A street lantern is here.

This area is illuminated.
You see the 1st city watchman and the 2nd city watchman.
Obvious paths: east* south* northwest*.
[Noble Way.]

The entire avenue is composed of fine cobblestone, each level with its neighbor, providing a smooth ride for passing carriages and horses. The stones were customized by craftsmen, cut to order, rather than simply placed wherever they might fit. A few stately oaks and elms line the sides of the road, shading travelers during the daylight hours.  A street lantern is here.

Numerous trees lining the avenue serve as the dividing border between the majestic estates of the nobility and the lightly traveled roadway. The estates themselves are noticeably closer to the avenue than those to the south. However, they are no easier to access, still protected by their own guarding walls, some covered with ivy or colorful blooming vines.  A street lantern is here.

Occasional gates and driveways lead back into the well-kept estates of the city's nobility, breaking and adding interest to the defining plane of the walls lining Noble Way. The rest of the street seems to mimic the splendor of the estates beyond the wall. Swept and trimmed, the roadway exudes a simple, yet beautiful elegance.  A street lantern is here.

[Noble Crossroads.]

A small roadway bordered by flowering hedges bisects the wide avenue of Noble Way at a right angle, heading east to west.  A thick, sturdy sign stands just off to the side of a charming path, its large friendly letters intent on luring travelers into the city's premiere roadstay, the Gilded Lion Inn. The entrance is clearly marked and welcoming, extending off to the southeast.  A wooden sign and a street lantern are here.

The roadway ends at a stately iron gate through which you can just glimpse the Governors Mansion in the distance. Smartly uniformed guards keep a vigilant watch over any that intend to pass through. The entire place has an authoritative bearing, suitable for an official residence.  There is a small sign posted off to one side.  A wooden sign, a street lantern, and an open diamond beaded crepe arch of leaves are here.

Impressively old oak trees line the sides of the cobblestone walkway that has been blanketed with a twinkling white carpet. The trees arch over the path, creating a canopy of crimson, golden, and orange leaves. Tiny white lights sparkle, shimmering softly with a soft white glow, as they hang from the gnarled branches. An exotic scarlet haired Sanene maiden, dressed in a flimsy red chiffon gown and a witches hat, stands underneath the diamond enwtined arch, offering trick and treats to guests.  Some glowing golden white paper lanterns, a deep scarlet haired Sanene witch, an open diamond beaded crepe arch of leaves, a bubbling black iron cauldron, and a bubbling black iron cauldron are here.

The stately elegance of the governor's mansion instills a strange sense of calm. A small carriage house stands to one side, bristling with servants ready to answer any visitor's call. A pair of intricately carved, broad mahogany stairs lead up to the mansion's gargoyle guarded door. Beside the banisters, ghoulishly carved pumpkins and deep burgundy and bright yellow chrysanthemums decorate the stairs.  A closed runic engraved mahogany door, some glowing hand-carved ghoulish pumpkins, a large brilliant yellow chrysanthemum plant, a large deep burgundy chrysanthemum plant, a jade encrusted silver drink cart, and a jade encrusted silver drink cart are here.

A narrow, well-manicured walkway winds its way around the northern side of the governor's mansion. Scarlet and golden chrysanthemums frame the cobblestone walkway, and the towering oak trees are crowned with autumn colors. A light breeze rushes through the trees, as the scent of apple cider carries on the air. As the wind blows, the faint sound of music plays festively on the air.

The air around you crackles as you enter the central chamber of the temple. Strongly charged with energy, a massive altar with the symbol of Sa carved upon the top sits in the center of the chamber.

Two large statues stand at the base of the stairs, also carved of breath-taking marble. One is a warrior bearing a massive sword and a large shield. The other is a cleric with an amulet bearing the mark of Odarous in one hand and a large mace in the other.

Beneath the colossal structure rests a large flowing marble fountain. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a shimmering blue pool. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each one a celebrated hero of Spur's past.  A carved marble statue of a Human, a carved marble statue of a Dragon, a broken brightly painted wooden birdhouse, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a flowing white marble fountain, some glowing intricately carved pumpkins, and a black and orange swirled satin invitation are here.
