[Forest stream.]

The path ends here as it comes upon the steep banks of a forest stream.  A wooden bridge, in surprisingly good repair, crosses the stream. The skeletal remains of some fish litter the stream bank and nosing about you notice some large pawprints.  A wooden bridge and some skeletal fish remains are here.

[Forest path.]

The path slopes down to the south here as it leads away from the hill.  The evergreens subside as the ground becomes moist due to the proximity of the stream. The undergrowth is quite thick here, and the music of the stream begins to pervade your senses.  A charming embankment is here.
