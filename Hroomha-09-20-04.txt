Leaves and small twigs spot the walkway as it hugs against the trunk of the Mother Tree. New sprouts from the branches above hang softly over the wooden planks, shading it slightly. A large building rests gently against the trunk in the limbs above, nestled as though it grew from within the tree itself.  An oak ladder is here.

>[Treehaven, Main Platform]

New wooden planks fit side by side creating the walkway that extends proudly upon the reconstructed supports. The view of the forest to the northwest is quite panoramic, despite the burnt spikes of trees in the midst. A staircase here seems to have some enchantment, judging by the strange appearance of unicorns, bears and owls on the lower steps. Strange, due to the fact that they don't appear carved, painted, or put there by any hand-made means. It is as if the glyphs grew into the wood itself. Mysterious symbols are scattered throughout the portraits, which shimmer with a golden whisper as they are approached.

Delicately crafted latticework serves as the railing opposite the recovering Mother tree. An arching bridge, which has slowly begun to be replaced by interwoven branches from the Mother Tree and the one to the north, spans the gap between the platform and the walkway residing against the nothern tree.

Obvious paths: north* southeast* west*.
[Treehaven, Oaken Bridge.]

Finely carved oak filigree lines the top edges of the oaken beams that serve as railing for the wooden bridge. Carvings of young firian maidens stand upon the ends of the handrails, decorating the walkway that spans the platforms between the Northern Tree and Mother Tree. Lush limbs have carefully wrapped around the bottom and sides of the bridge, creating a natural and firm foundation. The view of the surrounding forest is breathtaking.

Obvious paths: north* south*.
[Treehaven, Northern Platform]

The freshly built wooden walkway passes just in front of the refurbished tavern of old. Intricately crafted railings line the platform as it meanders about the Northern tree. A quaint building nestles itself within the protective branches.  An open elm door and a large wooden ramp are here.

Freshly crafted display cases and shelving cover the new walls that have replaced the ones from the old tavern.  A large rug covers the floor upon which a number of tables with small trinkets are displayed for sale.  The smell of fresh pine and flowers fills the shop.  An open elm door is here.

Finely carved oak filigree lines the top edges of the oaken beams that serve as railing for the wooden bridge. Carvings of young firian maidens stand upon the ends of the handrails, decorating the walkway that spans the platforms between the Northern Tree and Mother Tree. Lush limbs have carefully wrapped around the bottom and sides of the bridge, creating a natural and firm foundation. The view of the surrounding forest is breathtaking.

Delicately crafted latticework serves as the railing opposite the recovering Mother tree.

The small main room of the rune shop gleams with several different woods, most imported from the far corners of Aradath. The walls are paneled in dark mahogany. Sheets of crisp ivory parchment, listing the various runes and shapes and the costs, are hung on the walls. A narrow polished ebony counter against the far wall is arrayed with the tools of the rune implanter's trade; odd devices in a number of peculiar shapes. Svyrnafin greets you with a toothy Drag-al grin and gestures at you from across the smooth teak floor to have a seat in the leather chair placed conveniently close to the counter.  An ornately crafted oak ramp is here.

Nestled in the branches above the walkway is the bottom of a rather large building. Small, young branches stretch out from the trunk of the Mother Tree, reaching for open air and sunlight.

Brown and red leaves dance with the wind across the deck of the walkway, twirling and shifting in a slow, unending sway. Beyond the railing of the walkway is a breathtaking view of the surrounding forest. Many young trees stretch to the sky while several blackened trees now begin to sprout their own green colors of growth.

Thick and strong limbs have reached out from the base of the Mother Tree. The hearty limbs have twisted and woven themselves into an intricate staircase. Other limbs have woven into a firm and solid platform. Smaller, tenderer, limbs have gracefully grown up around the railing. Bright green leaves fan out between the gaps, and create a cool and shady walkway. The railing itself, made of interwoven strips of oak and maple, creates a lovely barrier to allow one to admire the forest below, but not fall to their death.  An intricately woven leaf stairway leading up is here.

An intricately woven staircase, made entirely of living leaves and limbs, gracefully descends to the main platform below. Stretching out before you, the grand limbs and branches of the Mother Tree extend out into the open air beyond. The view of the Caersech is breathtaking from this vantage point. Directly west the outline of Spur can be seen on the horizon. Shimmering lights glisten off the river below and bring a sparkle of beauty to this haven in the trees.

Stretching out above you is a large platform made of twisted limbs and leaves. The platform is quite huge and takes up most of the branch space in this area. Set directly over the platform, a rather large branch has grown out. The large green leaves on the branch fan out to create a cool and shady canopy. Black and brown spotted mushrooms grown along the trunk and glisten softly with dew.  Some twisted green leaf steps are here.

A rare and breathtaking golden moonflower vine has grown around the trunk of the Mother Tree. Thick and leafy branches have grown in an intricate pattern of walkways and railings. A few of the softer ones have formed themselves into soft places to sit and rest. Curious forest animals sit on the outer limbs, watching all those who pass through the area. The delicate scents of the tree drifts carelessly on the ever-present breeze. The air is cool up here and the views are clear and beyond breathtaking.

Spiraling through the branches in this part of the tree, a small clothing and coloring market has been set up. A rare and breathtaking golden moonflower vine has grown around the trunk of the Mother Tree. Thick and leafy branches have grown in an intricate pattern of walkways and railings. A few of the softer ones have formed themselves into soft places to sit and rest. Curious forest animals sit on the outer limbs, watching all those who pass through the area. The delicate scents of the tree drifts carelessly on the ever-present breeze. The air is cool up here and the views are clear and beyond breathtaking.

Rough and thick limbs have grown in a jagged way. Each limb has grown crooked and crosswise, creating an odd but firm staircase. Out a little ways into the thinner branches, a large stubby branch has grown into an odd shape. From this vantage point it appears that the branch is a small bear, standing in a defiant stance. The detail and curve of its body is unmistakable. The bear almost appears lifelike, and it is only by the fact that a small yellow bird has decided to rest on the bears head, that you are brought back to the realization that he is not real.

An ivory inlaid pine bar, a wooden stool, a long weathered wooden bench, a long musty wooden table, some steps circling the tree, some freshly crafted oak steps, an open door, a paper covered posting board, and a gilt framed painting on the wall are here.

The latticework surrounding and covering the spiral staircase is finely crafted. The intertwining beams seem to weave a delicate pattern above you, accenting the view of the forest floor. Soft, new, growth can be seen all over the forest below. A small mound of moss has slowly begun to cover the old inn, creating a fuzzy green mound. A large pile of Elven rope sits near the silent Golem. This creature of Elindale helps defend the city by retrieving the rope that people have pushed down to the forest below.  Some steps circling the tree and a freshly carved wooden sign are here.

Four sturdy walls and a roof of woven branches enclose this small tavern. From the forest floor, winding their way around the trunk of the Mother Tree, a set of intricately railed steps serve as the entrance and exit of the town of Treehaven. Strangers arriving at the top of the steps find themselves under the watchful eye of patrons seated at tables positioned about the light, airy room. A set of oak steps lead up to the new Council chambers.  An ivory inlaid pine bar, a wooden stool, a long weathered wooden bench, a long musty wooden table, some steps circling the tree, some freshly crafted oak steps, an open door, a paper covered posting board, and a gilt framed painting on the wall are here.

"Please PUSH the ROPE down if you wish to leave. 
Please do not pull the cord, you will confuse the poor Golem and he won't let anyone down for a while. Thank you!

Carefully winding its way up the base of the tree, and wrapping itself around the stairs, a flowering jasmine vine grows tall and lush. Dark scars from a past fire are almost hidden under tufts of fresh growth and moss. A large gap, nearly sixteen feet in distance, rests between the base of a set of stairs and the forest floor. A long moonsilver cord hangs down the side of the tree. If one pulls it, the long Elven rope will descend from above, allowing them to enter the great city of Treehaven. Bright green leaves of clover have begun springing up through the ashy soil in conjunction with soft moss to lend a durable cushion to this well-traveled spot.  Some vine-covered steps circling the tree, a freshly painted wooden sign, a healthy green patch of clover, a flowing marble fountain, some clover shaped stones, some sweet scented flowering jasmine vines, a long woven moonsilver cord, and an Elven rope are here.
