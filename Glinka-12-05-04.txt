The path seems to be disappearing before your very eyes. Travel any way but back to the northwest is blocked by foliage so dense as to prevent any further passage into the forest. An ancient oak tree festooned with bright colorful silk ribbons stands to the side of the disappearing path. Sparkling trinkets and gems hang from every available branch, a  cheerful tinkling noise filling the air with the slightest breeze.  A giant ancient oak tree, a fragrant bluish Secian rose, a tiny oak knothole, and some glowing enchanted twinkling diamond candles are here.

The forest path requires constant twisting and turning to navigate undeterred through the obstacle course of fallen trunks, thick spider webs, and lush fern and ivy growth. Though not obvious at first glance, a game trail does indeed snake its way through the rotting leaves and pine needles that make up the padded forest floor. A bright red cardinal, frightened by your sudden presence, takes wing and quickly vanishes, consumed by thick greenery all around.  Some glowing enchanted twinkling diamond candles are here.

An ever-present breeze rustles the leaves of the old, ominous oak trees that the forest path meanders through. A few tall pine trees are sprinkled throughout the expanse of oaks, contributing their needles and cones to the ocassional forest shower of wind dislodged debris. The path continues into the forest to the south, its serpentine nature lending to the ancient forest a means to disguise the final destination.

Rising up out of the plains, a large walled fort receives the end of the stone road. The river flows from either side, running through the fort from this angle of view.

The tradeway sinks a little lower as it gets closer to the river off to the west. A ditch runs alongside the river's side of the road, small puddles of water filling the bottom. Trickles filter into the puddles from the grass beyond as mosquitoes dart across the muddy surfaces.

A few blades of grass sway slightly in the breeze, some of them broken by the passing of something heavy over them. One of the larger stones in the road, broken loose from its mortar, waits patiently to be repaired.

The plains stretch as far as the eyes can see, the horizon and the walls of the fort down the road the only blemishes of the grassy landscape in the distance. The stones of the road are smoothly set together, well built to withstand heavy travel.

Two tall pines stand sentinel on either side of the small white stone lane. A neatly manicured lawn rides up against a smooth stone wall on both the southern and northern property line. The white road is made up of identically sized white stones that are so perfectly fitted together it is hard to tell that the road is not one long single piece. A single wooden bench sits under one of the larger trees, a nice place to rest and reflect.  An open large pine gate is here.

The broad expanse of lawn is dotted with pine cones and various animals. The wind blowing through the tall pine trees whistles as the mighty branches sway and dance far above. The white stone road splits as it heads towards the east, leading towards several sets of low slung bungalows. On the north side of the road a small cottage sits nestled among the trees. On the south side of the road a handsome two-story building a sign hanging on the front is carved with the single word, "Office."

Set among the large pine trees are four small white bungalows. Each with a uniquely colored door. They are set in an "L" shape, two of them north of the road and two of them east, a mirror reflection of the bungalows to the south. In front of each home is a beautiful garden, created to reflect the personality of those who live within. A well manicured courtyard sits in front of the homes dotted with smaller pines and benches. Small rabbits hop along unmolested nibbling upon the lush grass.  A closed blue pine door, a closed tan pine door, a closed red pine door, and a closed white pine door are here.

The garden is surrounded by a non-symmetrical stone wall done in earthen shades, yellow roses and wild vines clinging to its stony face. A small mosaic just barely peeking out from the mass of flowers and leaves can be viewed as the sun rises. In the midst of it all, a large willow tree spreads its massive branches over the area, colorful paper lanterns hanging within. A lush blanket of natural carpet, deep green clover spouting from the ground to form a soft pathway. The edge of the pond reaches to the edge of the path, the beginning of a breathtaking garden starting here. In the distance the calls of ducks and other wildlife can be heard. From one of the tallest tree branches, the echoing hum of busy bees sound from a golden beehive, the scent of honey filling the air with a delightful aroma.

A smooth gray marble floor flecked with white spreads out beneath you. A constant, calming sound of trickling water can be heard from a small matching marble fountain in the center. The fresh water trickles down from the three-tiered fountain spreading over little black and white pebbles in the basin. Pillows of bright colors, large and small, line the corner of the room, providing an inviting place for conversations and relaxation. A winding staircase with a thick wrought iron railing wraps its way upwards, only to grow hazy with wisps of mist as it reaches the ceiling. A few carved marble benches line the fountain for those that wish to sit next to it, the feet of the seating resembling that of a clawed Dragon.

Upon entering this pitch black painted circular room it is difficult to find your bearings at first. Much darker in hue than the rest of the areas, the decor has been styled to represent a midnight sky.  An ebony archway barely visible rests on the far wall, magick surrounding it, preventing visibility into the area on the other side. Astonishing platinum stars inlaid into the ceiling flicker in the low pillar candle light.  Magickal platinum flamed candles made of deep black beeswax rest upon small round ebony tables.  Light fluffy pillows shaped to resemble clouds are stacked in three corners, dark blue and indigo in shade.  A few warm fleece blankets are stacked upon a black marble shelf carved into the wall, allowing visitors to keep warm even on the coldest of nights.  A winding wrought iron railed staircase, a closed smooth black marble box dotted with stars, and a smooth ebony archway are here.

Bright light fills this room at all times of day, reminding of pure, natural sunlight.  The rays of illumination have a brassy tint to them, creating a warm hued glow upon the simple furniture of this open-air room. Only one wall stands here, a divider to some unseen area; covered in brilliant emerald vines, splitting and taking over through cracks and niches. A single dark green vine appears sturdy enough to climb. A handmade bronze sun rests upon the wall, attached at the rough hammered points, only barely visible through the vines. Furniture built of bronze and brass center around a small pond within the center of the room. Hardly deep, a few metallic-hued fish can be seen through the emerald greenish mossy waters. When night turns to day, the bronze sun glows momentarily as a pale blue mist comes from within it, creating a magickal faux sky overhead resembling that of noon time; slowly it fades away as the day truly changes and the stars outside fade from few.  A deep crack in the wall and a smooth ebony archway are here.

Mysterious mists form the barrier around this strange garden. Nothing can be seen of the route you took to get here. Giant sized flowers bloom all around you, each one a different color and shade. A lush carpet of jewel green grass cushions your feet. The call of exotic birds echo through the air. Breaking through the path of flowers you come upon a small clump of peach trees. Luscious fruits hang from their drooping branches. Some have already been plucked and placed in a large straw basket. At the center of the stand of trees is spread a large quilted blanket. Upon closer examination of the quilt you notice each square shows a different stage of being in the life of a dragon. Quiet descends around you, filling the area with a sense of peace.  A long vine, an open deep ribboned picnic basket, and a large multicolored quilted blanket are here.

Mysterious mists form the barrier around this strange garden. Nothing can be seen of the route you took to get here. Giant sized flowers bloom all around you, each one a different color and shade. A lush carpet of jewel green grass cushions your feet. The call of exotic birds echo through the air. Breaking through the path of flowers you come upon a small clump of peach trees. Luscious fruits hang from their drooping branches. Some have already been plucked and placed in a large straw basket. At the center of the stand of trees is spread a large quilted blanket. Upon closer examination of the quilt you notice each square shows a different stage of being in the life of a dragon. Quiet descends around you, filling the area with a sense of peace.  A long vine, an open deep ribboned picnic basket, and a large multicolored quilted blanket are here.

Bright light fills this room at all times of day, reminding of pure, natural sunlight.  The rays of illumination have a brassy tint to them, creating a warm hued glow upon the simple furniture of this open-air room. Only one wall stands here, a divider to some unseen area; covered in brilliant emerald vines, splitting and taking over through cracks and niches. A single dark green vine appears sturdy enough to climb. A handmade bronze sun rests upon the wall, attached at the rough hammered points, only barely visible through the vines. Furniture built of bronze and brass center around a small pond within the center of the room. Hardly deep, a few metallic-hued fish can be seen through the emerald greenish mossy waters. When night turns to day, the bronze sun glows momentarily as a pale blue mist comes from within it, creating a magickal faux sky overhead resembling that of noon time; slowly it fades away as the day truly changes and the stars outside fade from few.  A deep crack in the wall and a smooth ebony archway are here.

Upon entering this pitch black painted circular room it is difficult to find your bearings at first. Much darker in hue than the rest of the areas, the decor has been styled to represent a midnight sky.  An ebony archway barely visible rests on the far wall, magick surrounding it, preventing visibility into the area on the other side. Astonishing platinum stars inlaid into the ceiling flicker in the low pillar candle light.  Magickal platinum flamed candles made of deep black beeswax rest upon small round ebony tables.  Light fluffy pillows shaped to resemble clouds are stacked in three corners, dark blue and indigo in shade.  A few warm fleece blankets are stacked upon a black marble shelf carved into the wall, allowing visitors to keep warm even on the coldest of nights.  A winding wrought iron railed staircase, a closed smooth black marble box dotted with stars, and a smooth ebony archway are here.

A smooth gray marble floor flecked with white spreads out beneath you. A constant, calming sound of trickling water can be heard from a small matching marble fountain in the center. The fresh water trickles down from the three-tiered fountain spreading over little black and white pebbles in the basin. Pillows of bright colors, large and small, line the corner of the room, providing an inviting place for conversations and relaxation. A winding staircase with a thick wrought iron railing wraps its way upwards, only to grow hazy with wisps of mist as it reaches the ceiling. A few carved marble benches line the fountain for those that wish to sit next to it, the feet of the seating resembling that of a clawed Dragon. Affixed to one of the walls is a small plaque made of a blackened silvery-gray metal.  A blackened silver-trimmed plaque, a tall flowing marble fountain, and a mist covered cobblestone pathway are here.

Roughly carved wooden logs surround the blaze, allowing one to bask in the warmth of the flames. Shadows dance along the walls, forming the perfect backdrop of mystery. Charred-ended sticks are scattered about, some with the blackened remains of marshmallows and other roasted foods.  Some glowing mystical red swirled amber flames and a golden fire pit are here.

You can still make out what was once a glorious mosaic, depicting a fluffy white cloud puffing a breath of swirled white and sapphire wind. A warm breeze flows through the area, and whispers through the four supportive blue sapphire pillars holding aloft a highly polished dome roof. A few cracks in the silver dome allow rays of warm sunlight to enter, creating chaotic patterns on the floor as the sun moves throughout the day. Suddenly a myriad of bubbles surround you, dancing through the air entering from cracks within the wall. The bubbles pop as they touch any furniture or person and vanish from sight. Soft feather stuffed white and blue silk pillows lay in groups around the room, surprisingly untouched from the elements and popping bubbles.  A pile of blue and white feathered pillows is here.

A few fan-tailed fish swim through the underground pool and fade away from sight to some unknown area. A gentle breeze blows through the room at sporadic times, refreshing and soothing.

Overhead, the canopy of deep green leaves allows for only a little bit of sun to shine through, dappling the area in patches light. The dark brown trees seem ancient and impossibly huge. Vines climb across their branches, connecting each to the next. Lush vegetation grows around their bases; broad leafed ferns, and tropical flowers. A few rare copper tinted flowers sprout near the tallest of the dark trees. Bright jewel colored hummingbirds dart around cheerfully, not seeming to mind any noise or visitors. The roots of the largest tree in the center of the grove form a small depression, filled with the blue green waters accumulated during rainfall. Small stone benches rest in the nooks of the roots around the pool. Copper basins next to them are filled with refreshments.  A majestic willow tree and an ancient tarnished copper basin are here.

Cheerful laughter can be heard echoing through this open air garden as wisps of bright colors flash past. Secians run and play a game of mid-flight tag, merrily flying past one another as their rainbow wings become a blur. Gray flecked white marble benches line a small, deep blue pool filled with cool, tranquil waters with the exception of a stray duck making a crash-landing. Various sorts of flowers from every imaginable part of Aradath sprout in full bloom in all areas, nearly overtaking the pathway. A red rosebush stands out in particular, well kept, the flowers bloom brilliantly opening to the sun. The scent of delicate floral mixed with fresh grass and tall, green leafed trees makes for an intoxicatingly fresh aroma.  A red rosebush and a mist covered cobblestone pathway are here.

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool.
