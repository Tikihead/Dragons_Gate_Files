>[Bard's Guild.]

Bard instructors give lessons to those new to the trade in the arts of performance, poetry, music, writing, singing, borrowing a bit of coin from your audience, and more! The world famous Hithual singer, Golga Greybeard, leads the instruction for a number of aspiring would-be performers. Judging by the interesting noises filling the air, this must be one of their first lessons. On the stage toward the far end of the room, the more experienced bards perform for a small gathering.  A large polished oak stage and an open large carved oak instrument bin are here.

This room is illuminated.
Obvious exits: south*.
