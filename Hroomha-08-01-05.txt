An unusually large home, even for this part of town, lies off to the west. It seems as if one ambitious owner is slowly buying up the lots next to his and adding them to his own. Groundskeepers are at work in the surrounding gardens, trimming and raking, so intent on their work they do not bother to acknowledge the passing traffic on the road.  A street lantern is here.

Many grand, even ostentatious, homes line this stretch of Noble Way. Most of the residents here were fortunate enough to be born into the right families. Few that live in this area have ever actually had to work for a living. Glancing at the nameplates reveals many of the recognizable names of the Spur. Some of these names could almost be considered famous.  A street lantern is here.

Noble Way continues to wind its way among the rather modestly sized, but elegant, homes of the Spur's successful. Many a peasant farmer may live in homes larger than these, but none can match the quality found here. A peaceful, luxurious feeling pervades this part of town; perhaps it is the drifting floral scents wafting from the well-tended gardens.  A closed elegant black iron gate and a street lantern are here.

Gazing down each of the nearby private drives reveals a glimpse of a luxurious home, each a miniature estate in its own right. Short, stout walls and manicured hedges serve to keep out the riffraff and to protect the small, expensive gardens. Every detail has been attended to display the exotic plants, in all their pampered perfection.  A street lantern and a closed rosewood door are here.

Leaving the exceptionally wealthy estates of the Spurian nobility, Noble Way heads toward the Town Square to the northwest. Along the roadside can be seen the in-city homes of successful merchants and other wealthy citizens of the Spur. The homes display a slightly different style, perhaps they are not quite so restrained; a touch more exuberance and freedom with materials is displayed.  A street lantern is here.

The occasional locked gate marks the entrance to some of the more hidden estates of Spurs nobility. From this broad avenue, little can be seen of their splendor. Behind the imposing gate recedes a proud drive, disappearing mysteriously into the trees. If not for the large imposing tower rising above the hedges it would be hard to discern anything was beyond the gate. It is apparent the residents do not wish to be disturbed.

Through the gate lies the city of Spur, the major center of trade and civilization on the plains. The dusty road leading through the gates is well traveled, and walls of the city are in good repair. A small shack sits to the west of the road, during most times of the day a dusty coach can be seen waiting in front, its horses stomping with impatience to be gone. To the right of the door is a small window, its opening covered with metal bars. An old man, missing most of his teeth, waits patiently for the travelers to pay their fare, and then directs them into the waiting area. On the east side of the road a billowing multicolored tent has been erected, the hustle and bustle of merchants and customers can be seen coming and going at all times of the day.  An open iron gate and a rainbow silk tent are here.

A hedge of spiky brambles forms a natural division from the lands and the swampy terrain to the south. Tall, limbless trees dot the horizon there, their bases lost in the misty depths of the gases hovering over the waters. Now and then a strange, growling sound echos up to the north, or an odd, high-pitched call of some unseen crow, probably feasting on a fallen creature hidden in the mists. The path curves away from the sounds, as popular choice has preferred to travel around the edges, rather than through the marshy sludge.

The open plains are becoming scattered with scraggly trees, the wood of which proving inefficient to use for building as the elements of nature have grown the trunks so twisted and hard in order to withstand the onslaughts of time. Circling around the northern base of a small hill, there lies the lapping edge of the swamp to the south. Small slimy creatures lie on the smooth stones near the water, darting into it at the speed of light as you near them with tiny splashes and echoing wakes blending into the small, gentle waves coming into the shore. Swarms of mosquitoes move along the land in unison, lending them the appearance of large, unified bodies hovering around for the next feast.

Ravens dark as pitch spread their feathers to a wing-span of nearly four feet, so large they are, as they quarrel over an abandoned mule carcass on the roadside breaks out. How final death seems, so casually nature simply encompasses the bodies of the fallen, through carrion hunters or moldy decay. Yet through death there be life again, any number of these ravens being sustained through this death, so they may live. Perhaps only to become sustenance for one of the swamp creatures, who, in turn, spends its life continuing the cycle.

You follow Rafe west...

[Sky Lake.]

The shore gently slopes towards the lake, the water becoming much shallower the closer you get. The brown, dead grass on the shore seems odd this close to water. A thick stone wall just barely breaks the surface of the water. It stretches from shore to shore, running along the bottom of the lake and immerging on either side. The water is very cold. It is clear enough to allow you to see down to the silt-covered floor of the lake.   A brown grassy shore is here.

You follow Rafe through a brown grassy shore...

[Sky Lake - Shore.]

You are standing on a large patch of dead grass. The cliff looms above you, some rather dubious handholds the only means of scaling it. A tall stone wall starts at the cliff, runs north along side of the forest for a few paces and then veers east, straight across the narrow shore into the water. From here, it seems as if it continues underneath the water as well. Through an arch in the wall, you can see the shore; a swath of green grass edged by cerulean water and verdant forest. The air between the arch seems to shimmer, as does the stone of the wall when you are not looking at it directly.  A tall stone arch and a lake are here.

[Sky Lake - Shore.]

A tall stone wall runs from the forest edge and into the water. A dead, brown patch of grass can be seen through the arch of the wall, a contrast to your vibrant surroundings. The air between the arch seems to shimmer, as does the stone of the wall when you are not looking at it directly. The forest presses close to the water leaving only a thin strip of tall grass that serves as a path around the lake. The roar of the waterfall is still very loud, even here on the shore.   A tall stone arch is here.

[Sky Lake - Shore.]

A small group of rugged buildings stands in a semi-circle around the perimeter of the small clearing facing the lake. Barely inside of the clearing, the buildings almost completely blend in with their forest background. Traveling by the shore it is easy to completely miss them in passing. At first glance, the buildings look deserted. 

This area is illuminated.
You see the 1st darkly robed sanene scout corpse, the 2nd darkly robed sanene scout, and the 3rd darkly robed sanene scout.
In the area is Rafe the Leuian.
Obvious paths: north* east* west*.

A small group of rugged buildings stands in a semi-circle around the perimeter of the small clearing facing the lake. Barely inside of the clearing, the buildings almost completely blend in with their forest background. Traveling by the shore it is easy to completely miss them in passing. At first glance, the buildings look deserted.   A closed multicolored patched cotton carry-all and a heavy old banded bark mail are here.

[Sky Lake Forester's Commune.]

Although not deserted as it appeared from afar, activity within this small commune occurs with maintaining the tranquil atmosphere of the residents and forest in mind. Purposely camouflaged, the buildings almost completely blend in with the forest. There are no animal pens or other usual evidences of normal "civilized" life. You stand beside a large fire pit at the center of the semi-circle of simply constructed buildings. A small mossy bark building to the west, a sturdy brown bungalow to the northwest, large hexagonal wooden shelter to the north, and a sturdy green bungalow to the northeast.  A moss covered cabin is here.

A small group of rugged buildings stands in a semi-circle around the perimeter of the small clearing facing the lake. Barely inside of the clearing, the buildings almost completely blend in with their forest background. Traveling by the shore it is easy to completely miss them in passing. At first glance, the buildings look deserted.   A closed multicolored patched cotton carry-all and a heavy old banded bark mail are here.

In the area is Rafe the Leuian.

Although not deserted as it appeared from afar, activity within this small commune occurs with maintaining the tranquil atmosphere of the residents and forest in mind. Purposely camouflaged, the buildings almost completely blend in with the forest. There are no animal pens or other usual evidences of normal "civilized" life. You stand beside a large fire pit at the center of the semi-circle of simply constructed buildings. A small mossy bark building to the west, a sturdy brown bungalow to the northwest, large hexagonal wooden shelter to the north, and a sturdy green bungalow to the northeast.  A moss covered cabin is here.

Although not deserted as it appeared from afar, activity within this small commune occurs with maintaining the tranquil atmosphere of the residents and forest in mind. Purposely camouflaged, the buildings almost completely blend in with the forest. There are no animal pens or other usual evidences of normal "civilized" life. You stand beside a large fire pit at the center of the semi-circle of simply constructed buildings. A small mossy bark building to the west, a sturdy brown bungalow to the northwest, large hexagonal wooden shelter to the north, and a sturdy green bungalow to the northeast.  A moss covered cabin, a closed blood-stained burlap pouch, a closed tattered calfhide bag, a closed dirty wool bag, and a closed crafted sack are here.

[Sky Lake Forester's Commune - Familiars.]

Your thoughts are interrupted by a piercing hawk call as you enter, but an old Firian man soothes the bird as he returns it to its perch. He continues administering to his animals; feeding and nurturing the smaller animals housed in tidy wooden cages, paying particular attention to a small crate of young badgers. The larger creatures inhabit spacious pens, and the elderly forester distributes the appropriate foodstuffs to each animal. From the attention and thought he pays to every animal, it is clear he cares about them a great deal. Seated in a wooden rocking chair, a smiling, venerable old Firian woman awaits any customers.  An exit is here.

The women, female children and infants of the commune lodge in this bungalow. Three rows of bunk beds fill the single room of the building, leaving little room for much else. Surprised at your intrusion, a Fir Elf mother nursing her tiny infant blushes modestly and quickly covers herself and the child with a soft blue blanket. At the center of the room is circular brick hearth that warms the large room on cold days and nights.  An exit is here.

[Sky Lake Commune - Shelter.]

This wall-less shelter functions as a gathering place for meals, meetings and celebrations. Rows of sturdy tables and benches have been secured to the smooth raised wooden floor of the shelter, enough seating for the entire commune and then some. Long woven reed mats lay folded at the corners of the shelter. The tightly woven mats fasten at the edges of the roof and floor with tiny, metal hooks to keep out the elements and keep in the heat and easily remove again to allow for open ventilation during the hot months. Due to the erratic hours many of the hunters keep, one can find a hearty meal here at almost any time.  An exit is here.

A small group of rugged buildings stands in a semi-circle around the perimeter of the small clearing facing the lake. Barely inside of the clearing, the buildings almost completely blend in with their forest background. Traveling by the shore it is easy to completely miss them in passing. At first glance, the buildings look deserted.   A closed multicolored patched cotton carry-all and a heavy old banded bark mail are here.

An ancient willow growing in the middle of the boggy path bows its feathery leafed head towards the lake; the ends of its long trailing branches just barely touching the water.

A tall stone wall runs from the forest edge and into the water. A dead, brown patch of grass can be seen through the arch of the wall, a contrast to the flourishing lake, marsh and forest that surrounds you. The air between the arch seems to shimmer, as does the stone of the wall when you are not looking at it directly. The water and forest battle for possession of the ground around the lake, leaving only a thin strip of marshy land that serves as a path around the lake. The roar of the waterfall is still very loud, even here on the shore.   A tall stone arch is here.

[Sky Lake - Shore.]

An ancient willow growing in the middle of the boggy path bows its feathery leafed head towards the lake; the ends of its long trailing branches just barely touching the water. Over the years the waters of the lake have eroded the soil and exposed some of the willow's gnarled roots providing a haven for a family of tiny croaking frogs. The ground grows drier the further north you travel.

[Sky Lake - Shore.]

The lake has encroached upon the path, turning a once dry path into a soggy mess. Muck from the marshy bog sticks to your boots. Each movement of your foot creates a large sucking sound, as you attempt to muddle your way through the mud. Tall green marsh grass grows all around you, making your footing difficult to determine. One misstep and it is certain your clothing will be ruined.

The lake has encroached upon the path, turning a once dry path into a soggy mess. Muck from the marshy bog sticks to your boots. Each movement of your foot creates a large sucking sound, as you attempt to muddle your way through the mud. Tall green marsh grass grows all around you, making your footing difficult to determine. One misstep and it is certain your clothing will be ruined.

An ancient willow growing in the middle of the boggy path bows its feathery leafed head towards the lake; the ends of its long trailing branches just barely touching the water. Over the years the waters of the lake have eroded the soil and exposed some of the willow's gnarled roots providing a haven for a family of tiny croaking frogs. The ground grows drier the further north you travel.

A tall stone wall runs from the forest edge and into the water. A dead, brown patch of grass can be seen through the arch of the wall, a contrast to the flourishing lake, marsh and forest that surrounds you. The air between the arch seems to shimmer, as does the stone of the wall when you are not looking at it directly. The water and forest battle for possession of the ground around the lake, leaving only a thin strip of marshy land that serves as a path around the lake. The roar of the waterfall is still very loud, even here on the shore.   A tall stone arch is here.

The water and forest battle for possession of the ground around the lake, leaving only a thin strip of marshy land that serves as a path around the lake. The roar of the waterfall is still very loud, even here on the shore.   A tall stone arch is here.

An ancient willow growing in the middle of the boggy path bows its feathery leafed head towards the lake; the ends of its long trailing branches just barely touching the water. Over the years the waters of the lake have eroded the soil and exposed some of the willow's gnarled roots providing a haven for a family of tiny croaking frogs. The ground grows drier the further north you travel.

The lake has encroached upon the path, turning a once dry path into a soggy mess. Muck from the marshy bog sticks to your boots. Each movement of your foot creates a large sucking sound, as you attempt to muddle your way through the mud. Tall green marsh grass grows all around you, making your footing difficult to determine. One misstep and it is certain your clothing will be ruined.

An ancient willow growing in the middle of the boggy path bows its feathery leafed head towards the lake; the ends of its long trailing branches just barely touching the water. Over the years the waters of the lake have eroded the soil and exposed some of the willow's gnarled roots providing a haven for a family of tiny croaking frogs. The ground grows drier the further north you travel.   A bloody scout head is here.

A tall stone wall starts at the cliff, runs north along side of the forest for a few paces and then veers east, straight across the narrow shore into the water. From here, it seems as if it continues underneath the water as well. Through an arch in the wall, you can see the shore; a swath of green grass edged by cerulean water and verdant forest.

The landscape abruptly ends causing the churning water of the river to spew forth into the air and thunderously pour into the lake far below. Standing at the cliff's edge, with the waterfall roaring in your ears, you view the wide expanse of Sky Lake. Surrounded by verdant forest, it gleams brilliant cerulean on even the most overcast of days. At this height, you can see smoke curling up from the far shore, a possible sign of settlement. A knotted rope of heavy hemp, tied around a massive oak several yards away from the water, dangles down the side of the cliff, offering means to descend to the lake.

Immense oak trees are anchored on the shore slopes, their strength obvious as the water tries to erode their soil foundations.

The river bed, devoid of water where you walk, spans ten feet on each side, and then slants upward steeply. Large oak trees fight for space on the slope, each receiving nutrition from the river and the sun above.

Eyes of creatures too quick to be seen monitor your progress along the road. Their footprints can be seen occasionally, leading back and forth across the path, sometimes following along the edges, bringing to mind the vision of something that might be following you, at this very moment, leaving tiny or perhaps not so tiny footprints along the edge of the road as it stalks its prey.

The dried trees encroach even up to the roadside, here, their limbs reaching down to the passage as if to snatch the unwary passer-by. A sudden shift in the wind brings forth the sullied aroma of death and decay from the swamp southern lands. Slurpish noises belie the path of some creature traveling through the muddy scape, their movements hidden behind the smoky mist that reduces visibility to a mere few feet past the swamp's edge.

The open plains are becoming scattered with scraggly trees, the wood of which proving inefficient to use for building as the elements of nature have grown the trunks so twisted and hard in order to withstand the onslaughts of time. Circling around the northern base of a small hill, there lies the lapping edge of the swamp to the south. Small slimy creatures lie on the smooth stones near the water, darting into it at the speed of light as you near them with tiny splashes and echoing wakes blending into the small, gentle waves coming into the shore. Swarms of mosquitoes move along the land in unison, lending them the appearance of large, unified bodies hovering around for the next feast.

A hedge of spiky brambles forms a natural division from the lands and the swampy terrain to the south. Tall, limbless trees dot the horizon there, their bases lost in the misty depths of the gases hovering over the waters. Now and then a strange, growling sound echos up to the north, or an odd, high-pitched call of some unseen crow, probably feasting on a fallen creature hidden in the mists. The path curves away from the sounds, as popular choice has preferred to travel around the edges, rather than through the marshy sludge.

A wooden signpost gives the directions and distances to the two closest cities. The arrow leading west is denoted as Spur, while the one directing east states Caersech. Next to the signpost rests an elderly druid amidst a cushion of moss, leaves, and flower petals. He is currently lecturing a young apprentice on the city of Spur and the negative effects it has had on nature.

A small shack sits to the west of the road, during most times of the day a dusty coach can be seen waiting in front, its horses stomping with impatience to be gone. To the right of the door is a small window, its opening covered with metal bars. An old man, missing most of his teeth, waits patiently for the travelers to pay their fare, and then directs them into the waiting area. On the east side of the road a billowing multicolored tent has been erected, the hustle and bustle of merchants and customers can be seen coming and going at all times of the day.

The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.

[Town Square Center.]

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.   A flowing white marble fountain, a marble statue of a Human, a shimmering marble statue of a Dragon, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a rosewood sign, a crisp gold lettered vellum notice, and a broken battle scarred ebony parrying shield are here.

People carrying bundles stream in from the west and rapidly lose themselves in the large crowds moving about in the vast town square. Several citizens head west with bulging coinpurses babbling excitedly about what they're going to purchase. Giggling children dart around the slower moving folks rushing on their way to spend the silvers in their pockets.  A street lantern is here.

A neatly kept park fronts this portion of Merchant Walk. Topiary and low shrubberies partition off small sections of the park.

Merchants, some in frilly finery, others dressed in homespun wools, travel back and forth along this street on their way to and from work. They seem to blend together here, if only briefly.

Several city guardsmen have just finished wrestling to the ground some young tough thieves, who thought to rob one of the returning merchants.

His pleas fall on deaf ears as the guards drag him away.  A street lantern is here.

Merchant Walk comes to an abrupt end at a massive moonsilver gate.

Just beyond the gates one can glimpse the bustling Merchant District of Spur.  A gilded oak sign and a street lantern are here.

A large gate separates the Merchant District and Town Square-the hub of Spur's activity. The partially opened gate is currently able to accommodate the simultaneous passage of several locals and visitors, but can be expanded to accept carriages, or sealed to ward against invasion.  Guards stand sentry from atop the wall as well as the ground.  A street lantern is here.

The buildings of Market Circle stand to the south. It becomes obvious that the area through the arch is a much cleaner marketplace than the bazaar. An inviting eatery stands beside the road, its door open to those weary after a long trip to Spur, as well as those preparing to venture to the great expanses beyond the west gate.

Adventurers with sacks of plundered goods leave Market Street and head west where a shrewd businessman has set up shop in this busy area of the Market District. A small shop stands slightly to the east of the arch leading into Merchant Circle, light shining through its red glass door and illuminating the store front in a cheerful, ruby glow.  A street lantern, an opaque ruby red glass door, and a gold lettered wooden sign are here.

Many people crowd the narrow Bazaar Path, either heading towards the infamous Bazaar, or forcing their way back towards Trade Way. For a small price, a farmer can rent a booth and directly market his goods. Both some of the best and some of the worst deals can be made within this collection of stalls. The tall wall of Spur looms high to the east, and many of the guards take an early peek into the carts and the goods coming to market.  A street lantern is here.

Further passage along Bazaar Path is blocked occasionally by brawling peasants.

Other than the odd customer passing en route to another shop, nobody pauses before this empty stall. Stalls such as these are rented out to the locals for their personal use. Bits of refuse from food sold to the south litter the ground.  This stall is becoming someone's personal trash dump.

At this intersection many stands display their exotic foodstuffs. Hanging from large hooks are various unidentifiable hunks of meat, and vegetables of all shapes and colors. The only thing more prevalent than the merchants and buyers are the bugs, who clamor to find the most pungent item to land on. To the northeast a small tent can barely be seen hiding behind the stalls.  A white silk tent and a street lantern are here.

The well-defined Bazaar path heads off to the west. This corner is a mix of the old and the new. On one corner an old stall is barely standing. The roof has caved in, and it quickly becomes apparent that this location has become a local dump. Pieces of wood that look suspiciously like some of the leftovers from other construction sites are piled on top of rotting offal.

A new stall has been hastily constructed on this site, in the shadow of the large Spurian Wall. Most chose to build well within the Bazaar as opposed to this outer path. Low-grade wood and bent nails make up this sorry excuse for a business establishment. A small sign on the front has a crude picture of a key on it, and the name, "Skugz."  A crooked wooden sign, a weathered dark wooden stall, and a broken street lantern are here.

Two large Oog-ra guards refuse to allow anyone to continue south. With loud gestures and over exaggerated pointing, they send wagons to the east or back north. With some slapping of backs, and happy grins, they congratulate themselves on following directions. A yell is heard from the south as Skugz screams, "Keep meee dooor clear...yes yeees...keep it clear." It is a wonder that he hasn't figured out they are turning away his customers.

A slinky dressed female San Elf preens and giggles garnering the attention of several humans leaning out the window of the guards' quarters.

Bazaar Path follows the line of the Spurian Wall. High above you can hear orders being barked and guards marching in rhythm.

Several large carts head west, full of various items the owners are sure will sell for a decent profit. Empty carts, the sign of a prosperous day, head east. An old Thugian pulls and pushes a very stubborn donkey. Neither end seems to be cooperating with his demands.

Quickly, he takes out a switch, which is enough encouragement for both the donkey to move and the children to run.  A street lantern is here.

[Town Square Center.]

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.   A flowing white marble fountain, a marble statue of a Human, a shimmering marble statue of a Dragon, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a rosewood sign, a crisp gold lettered vellum notice, a broken battle scarred ebony parrying shield, and a two-handed bloody blackened steel broadsword are here.

This area is illuminated.
You see the 1st taathian priest.
In the area are Connor the San Elf, Quark the Noble Oog-ra, Creon the Noble Monitanian, Severina the Frontacian, Roxi the San Elf, Rafe the Leuian, Marial the Novice Secian, Nicki the Noble Hithual, Ather the Anthian, Grinard the Novice Psycian, and Blade the Noble Thugian.

Grinard's head suddenly begins glowing. He places a hand upon his chest. The glow travels down an arm to his hand. The glow quickly spreads over Grinard's entire body, then fades away.

' got war?

Hroomha asks in Oog-ra, " got war?"

A fluffy kitten suddenly appears.

Fiery runes begin to circle around Severina, forming ripples of heat in the air.

Quark yawns Yeh.

The ripples of heat are absorbed into Severina's body, leaving her looking refreshed!

The air around Severina's body quickly cools.

Grinard just went south.

The taathian priest wanders southeast.

Quark murmurs something beneath his breath.

The elegant Hotel Royale towers above the street, its emerald door sparkling in the light. The patrons that stroll in and out are catered to, doors opened and closed for them, and baggage and packages carried by harried servants. The large Bank of Spur sits on the east side of the square. Its location close to the Royale is not a coincidence. A gold-trimmed door is proof of the success of this branch of the Spurian bank and those who run it.  An elegant gold-trimmed walnut door, an open emerald steel door, a street lantern, and a new rosewood sign pointing southeast are here.

A short entrance hall provides passage in and out of the exquisite Hotel Royale. A burly Thugian and a tall Monitanian carefully assess everyone as they enter. They prevent any pets from entering and keep out all but the quickest or sneakiest of the riffraff. A narrow passageway leads to the stables.  An open emerald steel door is here.
