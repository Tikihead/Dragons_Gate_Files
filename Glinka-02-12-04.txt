In this rather large study you see enough arcane reading material to keep you occupied for quite some time. It is apparent that Norius'a has spent many hours here poring over her vast collection of prose and poetry. The room is built for comfort; not only for the Imperial, but for her Secian friends as well.  An antique maple escritoire, a crystalla glass of magnification, a closed rune covered rosewood traveling trunk, and a tiny soft pallet are here.

This area is illuminated.
In the area are Miriel the Secian, Equality the Noble Secian, Domi the Secian, Voskresenieye the Drake (seated), and Linneastrylon the Noble Secian.

She can be attacked by other players.

On her wings is a soft sheen of stardust, and the edges are adorned with myriad opals and moonstones, gleaming incandescent.

She appears to be in perfect health.

The walls are hewn from the earth and stone; huge, gnarled tree roots snake their way from top to bottom, looking as if they could reach out and grab you. The floor has been packed down so thoroughly that it nearly shines; it seems some very heavy footsteps have traveled across this floor.  A Cave opening and a tall mound of soil are here.

This area is illuminated.
In the area are Darrow the Secian, Miriel the Secian, Attkayet'a the Dragon, Aelestithiel the Noble Drake, Domi the Secian, Linneastrylon the Noble Secian, and Chip the Secian.
Obvious paths: north* northeast* northwest*.

[Dragon cavern.]

Opening up before you is a huge, cavernous room. The walls are hewn from the earth and stone; huge, gnarled tree roots snake their way from top to bottom, looking as if they could reach out and grab you. The floor has been packed down so thoroughly that it nearly shines; it seems some very heavy footsteps have traveled across this floor.  A Cave opening and a tall mound of soil are here.

This area is illuminated.
In the area are Darrow the Secian, Relawen the Drake, Linneastrylon the Noble Secian, Ceresina the Noble Secian (flying 5 feet above ground), Chip the Secian, and Kalessin the Noble Drake.

smi wryly as she steps from the shadows...
Welcome to Dragon's Gate, Glinka!

Good evening! Your view of the heavens is obstructed.

[Dragon cavern.]

Opening up before you is a huge, cavernous room. The walls are hewn from the earth and stone; huge, gnarled tree roots snake their way from top to bottom, looking as if they could reach out and grab you. The floor has been packed down so thoroughly that it nearly shines; it seems some very heavy footsteps have traveled across this floor.  A Cave opening and a tall mound of soil are here.

This area is illuminated.
Obvious paths: north* northeast* northwest*.

[Dragon cavern.]

Opening up before you is a huge, cavernous room. The walls are hewn from the earth and stone; huge, gnarled tree roots snake their way from top to bottom, looking as if they could reach out and grab you. The floor has been packed down so thoroughly that it nearly shines; it seems some very heavy footsteps have traveled across this floor.  A Cave opening and a tall mound of soil are here.

This area is illuminated.
In the area are Kalessin the Noble Drake, Ceresina the Noble Secian (flying 5 feet above ground), and Linneastrylon the Noble Secian.

Opening up before you is a huge, cavernous room. The walls are hewn from the earth and stone; huge, gnarled tree roots snake their way from top to bottom, looking as if they could reach out and grab you. The floor has been packed down so thoroughly that it nearly shines; it seems some very heavy footsteps have traveled across this floor.  A Cave opening and a tall mound of soil are here.

This area is illuminated.
In the area are Ceresina the Noble Secian (flying 5 feet above ground) and Linneastrylon the Noble Secian.
Obvious paths: north* northeast* northwest*.

>[Dragon cavern.]

Opening up before you is a huge, cavernous room. The walls are hewn from the earth and stone; huge, gnarled tree roots snake their way from top to bottom, looking as if they could reach out and grab you. The floor has been packed down so thoroughly that it nearly shines; it seems some very heavy footsteps have traveled across this floor.  A Cave opening and a tall mound of soil are here.

This area is illuminated.
In the area are Kalessin the Noble Drake, Ceresina the Noble Secian (flying 5 feet above ground), and Linneastrylon the Noble Secian.

[Dragon cavern.]

Opening up before you is a huge, cavernous room. The walls are hewn from the earth and stone; huge, gnarled tree roots snake their way from top to bottom, looking as if they could reach out and grab you. The floor has been packed down so thoroughly that it nearly shines; it seems some very heavy footsteps have traveled across this floor.  A Cave opening and a tall mound of soil are here.

This area is illuminated.
In the area are Pollii the Secian (holding a glowing pure white crystal long-stemmed rose), Relawen the Drake, Kalessin the Noble Drake, Ceresina the Noble Secian (flying 5 feet above ground), Linneastrylon the Noble Secian, and Chip the Secian (holding a glowing gold-flecked crystalla shard).
Obvious paths: north* northeast* northwest*.

[Dragon cavern.]

Opening up before you is a huge, cavernous room. The walls are hewn from the earth and stone; huge, gnarled tree roots snake their way from top to bottom, looking as if they could reach out and grab you. The floor has been packed down so thoroughly that it nearly shines; it seems some very heavy footsteps have traveled across this floor.  A Cave opening and a tall mound of soil are here.

This area is illuminated.
In the area are Pollii the Secian (holding a glowing pure white crystal long-stemmed rose), Relawen the Drake, Kalessin the Noble Drake, Ceresina the Noble Secian (flying 5 feet above ground), Linneastrylon the Noble Secian, and Chip the Secian (holding a glowing gold-flecked crystalla shard).

smi wryly as she steps from the shadows...
Welcome to Dragon's Gate, Glinka!

Good evening! Your view of the heavens is obstructed.

[Dragon cavern.]

Opening up before you is a huge, cavernous room. The walls are hewn from the earth and stone; huge, gnarled tree roots snake their way from top to bottom, looking as if they could reach out and grab you. The floor has been packed down so thoroughly that it nearly shines; it seems some very heavy footsteps have traveled across this floor.  A Cave opening and a tall mound of soil are here.

This area is illuminated.
In the area is Ceresina the Noble Secian (flying 5 feet above ground).
Obvious paths: north* northeast* northwest*.

Standing before you is a huge wall of thorny roots.  They have doubled back upon themselves so many times that it is impossible to see anything behind them. A strange, slightly familiar scent wafts through here. The encroaching flora makes this spot slightly claustrophobic.  A slightly vine-covered Dragon runeward, a blackened vine-covered Dragon runeward, a blackened arcane glyph, a vine-covered semicircle of runewards, a rotting wyvern ribcage, a cracked wyvern skull, a tall mound of soil, an oddly shaped collection of rocks, a jagged mixed earthen conglomerate, a small hole, a cave opening, and a widened opening are here.

This area is illuminated.
In the area is Kalessin the Noble Drake (flying 15 feet above ground).

Here, in the center of the massive lair, is Norius'a's hoard. The number of gems here is astounding; they seem to glow in the dim torchlight. Massive tree roots have been trained into a complex, web-like network overhead. Tiny round pillows in many brilliant colors are placed in various spots all around the room, evidently for the comfort of visiting Secians.

In this rather large study you see enough arcane reading material to keep you occupied for quite some time. It is apparent that Norius'a has spent many hours here poring over her vast collection of prose and poetry. The room is built for comfort; not only for the Imperial, but for her Secian friends as well.  An antique maple escritoire, a crystalla glass of magnification, a closed rune covered rosewood traveling trunk, and a tiny soft pallet are here.

This area is illuminated.

It is in this small, round room that Norius'a spends her most private moments. It is covered from wall to wall with the thickest, most luxurious fur you've ever seen or felt. While it is inviting, it seems a breach of her privacy to be standing here.  An indigo embroidered silk pillow is here.

[Dragon cavern.]

Opening up before you is a huge, cavernous room. The walls are hewn from the earth and stone; huge, gnarled tree roots snake their way from top to bottom, looking as if they could reach out and grab you. The floor has been packed down so thoroughly that it nearly shines; it seems some very heavy footsteps have traveled across this floor.  A Cave opening and a tall mound of soil are here.

This area is illuminated.
In the area are Ceresina the Noble Secian (flying 5 feet above ground), Linneastrylon the Noble Secian, Chip the Secian (holding a glowing gold-flecked crystalla shard), Pollii the Secian (holding a glowing pure white crystal long-stemmed rose), and Relawen the Drake.

Opening up before you is a huge, cavernous room. The walls are hewn from the earth and stone; huge, gnarled tree roots snake their way from top to bottom, looking as if they could reach out and grab you. The floor has been packed down so thoroughly that it nearly shines; it seems some very heavy footsteps have traveled across this floor.  A Cave opening and a tall mound of soil are here.

This area is illuminated.
In the area are Ceresina the Noble Secian (flying 5 feet above ground) and Linneastrylon the Noble Secian.

Standing before you is a huge wall of thorny roots.  They have doubled back upon themselves so many times that it is impossible to see anything behind them. A strange, slightly familiar scent wafts through here. The encroaching flora makes this spot slightly claustrophobic.  A slightly vine-covered Dragon runeward, a blackened vine-covered Dragon runeward, a blackened arcane glyph, a vine-covered semicircle of runewards, a rotting wyvern ribcage, a cracked wyvern skull, a tall mound of soil, an oddly shaped collection of rocks, a jagged mixed earthen conglomerate, a small hole, a cave opening, and a widened opening are here.

This area is illuminated.
In the area is Kalessin the Noble Drake (flying 10 feet above ground).

Opening up before you is a huge, cavernous room. The walls are hewn from the earth and stone; huge, gnarled tree roots snake their way from top to bottom, looking as if they could reach out and grab you. The floor has been packed down so thoroughly that it nearly shines; it seems some very heavy footsteps have traveled across this floor.  A Cave opening and a tall mound of soil are here.

This area is illuminated.
In the area are Ceresina the Noble Secian (flying 5 feet above ground) and Linneastrylon the Noble Secian.

Here, in the center of the massive lair, is Norius'a's hoard. The number of gems here is astounding; they seem to glow in the dim torchlight. Massive tree roots have been trained into a complex, web-like network overhead. Tiny round pillows in many brilliant colors are placed in various spots all around the room, evidently for the comfort of visiting Secians.

This area is illuminated.

Incense fills the air in this small room, so thick it is difficult to see. On the far wall, set into a niche, sits a single, massive gem unlike any you've ever seen before. It is faceted like a diamond, yet its surface gleams with a swirling, opalescent shimmer. It almost looks alive. Flanking the niche on either side are a pair of stone dragons.  A mysterious shimmering diamond is here.

It is in this small, round room that Norius'a spends her most private moments. It is covered from wall to wall with the thickest, most luxurious fur you've ever seen or felt. While it is inviting, it seems a breach of her privacy to be standing here.  An indigo embroidered silk pillow is here.

In this rather large study you see enough arcane reading material to keep you occupied for quite some time. It is apparent that Norius'a has spent many hours here poring over her vast collection of prose and poetry. The room is built for comfort; not only for the Imperial, but for her Secian friends as well.  An antique maple escritoire, a crystalla glass of magnification, a closed rune covered rosewood traveling trunk, and a tiny soft pallet are here.

Standing before you is a huge wall of thorny roots.  They have doubled back upon themselves so many times that it is impossible to see anything behind them. A strange, slightly familiar scent wafts through here. The encroaching flora makes this spot slightly claustrophobic.  A slightly vine-covered Dragon runeward, a blackened vine-covered Dragon runeward, a blackened arcane glyph, a vine-covered semicircle of runewards, a rotting wyvern ribcage, a cracked wyvern skull, a tall mound of soil, an oddly shaped collection of rocks, a jagged mixed earthen conglomerate, a small hole, a cave opening, and a widened opening are here.

The few lone fir trees that once stood mighty in this open plain have been broken in half and thrown casually to the side. The earth has been ripped up, exposing the dark black soil underneath. Several piles of grass, moss, rocks, and soil are piled in various directions, remnants of the freshly excavated ground. The giant hole leading into the ground reveals a dense curtain of thorny roots, surrounded by a multitude of strange symbols.  A light branch, some broken fir trees, a freshly expanded hole, a towering mound of soil, a towering mound of soil, a towering mound of soil, a towering mound of freshly dug earth, a towering mound of freshly dug earth, and a newly excavated opening are here.

The small shack is set back from the road, its walls built of a whitewashed birch. A sturdy corral, filled with well-fed horses, stands to the left of the shack. A matched pair of dapple grays stand in front of the shack waiting to take their human baggage to their destination. To the left of the door, behind a small paned window, a beautiful Fir Elf female takes coin and in return, with a charming smile, directs those who have paid their fare into the waiting room.  A small shack, a freshly painted sign, a notice of non-refund, and a small winding stone pathway are here.

The intricate woodwork that decorates the steps is of the finest quality, as if in parody to the blackened destruction of the hedges and brambles around the base of the trunk. Bright green leaves of clover have begun springing up through the ashy soil in conjunction with soft moss to lend a durable cushion to this well-traveled spot.

Contrasting starkly with the ashes of the forest and brush is a freshly constructed set of stairs that wraps itself about the large tree. The intricate woodwork that decorates the steps is of the finest quality, as if in parody to the blackened destruction of the hedges and brambles around the base of the trunk. Bright green leaves of clover have begun springing up through the ashy soil in conjunction with soft moss to lend a durable cushion to this well-traveled spot.  Some steps circling the tree, a freshly painted wooden sign, a healthy green patch of clover, a flowing marble fountain, and some clover shaped stones are here.

The path of four leaf clove shaped flagstones leads past a small clean shack and into a well formed tunnel through the thorn bushes to the east and the Caersech to the west. The small shack is set back from the road, its walls built of a whitewashed birch. A sturdy corral, filled with well-fed horses, stands to the left of the shack. A matched pair of dapple grays stand in front of the shack waiting to take their human baggage to their destination. To the left of the door, behind a small paned window, a beautiful Fir Elf female takes coin and in return, with a charming smile, directs those who have paid their fare into the waiting room.  A small shack, a freshly painted sign, a notice of non-refund, and a small winding stone pathway are here.

[Dragon cavern.]

Opening up before you is a huge, cavernous room. The walls are hewn from the earth and stone; huge, gnarled tree roots snake their way from top to bottom, looking as if they could reach out and grab you. The floor has been packed down so thoroughly that it nearly shines; it seems some very heavy footsteps have traveled across this floor.  A Cave opening and a tall mound of soil are here.

This area is illuminated.
In the area are Ceresina the Noble Secian (flying 5 feet below you) and Meliya the Noble Secian.

[Dragon cavern.]

Here, in the center of the massive lair, is Norius'a's hoard. The number of gems here is astounding; they seem to glow in the dim torchlight. Massive tree roots have been trained into a complex, web-like network overhead. Tiny round pillows in many brilliant colors are placed in various spots all around the room, evidently for the comfort of visiting Secians.

This area is illuminated.
Obvious paths: north* east* south* west*.

Incense fills the air in this small room, so thick it is difficult to see. On the far wall, set into a niche, sits a single, massive gem unlike any you've ever seen before. It is faceted like a diamond, yet its surface gleams with a swirling, opalescent shimmer. It almost looks alive. Flanking the niche on either side are a pair of stone dragons.  A mysterious shimmering diamond is here.

This area is illuminated.
In the area are Domi the Secian, Attkayet'a the Dragon, Gellidus the Drake, Miriel the Secian, Aelestithiel the Noble Drake, and Lilyth the Noble Secian (flying 5 feet above you).
Obvious paths: southeast* south* southwest*.
>
Aelestithiel asks Domi in Secian, "where?"

Attkayet'a says in Secian, "And if the lair was still viable."
' my bad

Glinka says, " my bad"
>
Domi asks Glinka in Secian, "where's the wyvern?"

Attkayet'a says in Secian, "As it is not."

Domi says in Secian, "oh"

Miriel grins.

Gellidus says to Attkayet'a, "It still is"
' outside again

Glinka says, " outside again"

Aelestithiel nods.

[Open plains]

The few lone fir trees that once stood mighty in this open plain have been broken in half and thrown casually to the side. The earth has been ripped up, exposing the dark black soil underneath. Several piles of grass, moss, rocks, and soil are piled in various directions, remnants of the freshly excavated ground. The giant hole leading into the ground reveals a dense curtain of thorny roots, surrounded by a multitude of strange symbols.  A light branch, some broken fir trees, a freshly expanded hole, a towering mound of soil, a towering mound of soil, a towering mound of soil, a towering mound of freshly dug earth, a towering mound of freshly dug earth, a newly excavated opening, and an open weathered leather pouch are here.

smi wryly as she steps from the shadows...
Welcome to Dragon's Gate, Glinka!

Good evening! The stars sparkle like tiny gems in the evening sky.
The weather is currently clear and winds are calm.
The waning (2nd quarter) moon is shining brightly.

[Open plains]

The few lone fir trees that once stood mighty in this open plain have been broken in half and thrown casually to the side. The earth has been ripped up, exposing the dark black soil underneath. Several piles of grass, moss, rocks, and soil are piled in various directions, remnants of the freshly excavated ground. The giant hole leading into the ground reveals a dense curtain of thorny roots, surrounded by a multitude of strange symbols.  A light branch, some broken fir trees, a freshly expanded hole, a towering mound of soil, a towering mound of soil, a towering mound of soil, a towering mound of freshly dug earth, a towering mound of freshly dug earth, and a newly excavated opening are here.

This area is illuminated.
You see the 1st massive green wyvern, the 1st green wyvern, the 1st young green wyvern, the 2nd young green wyvern, the 3rd young green wyvern, and the 2nd massive green wyvern.

[Open plains]

The few lone fir trees that once stood mighty in this open plain have been broken in half and thrown casually to the side. The earth has been ripped up, exposing the dark black soil underneath. Several piles of grass, moss, rocks, and soil are piled in various directions, remnants of the freshly excavated ground. The giant hole leading into the ground reveals a dense curtain of thorny roots, surrounded by a multitude of strange symbols.  A light branch, some broken fir trees, a freshly expanded hole, a towering mound of soil, a towering mound of soil, a towering mound of soil, a towering mound of freshly dug earth, a towering mound of freshly dug earth, and a newly excavated opening are here.

This area is illuminated.
You see the 1st young green wyvern, the 2nd young green wyvern, the 1st white tailed doe, the 2nd white tailed doe, and the 1st massive green wyvern.
In the area are Kandil the Leuian, Lilioth the Secian (holding a glowing gold-flecked crystalla shard), Equality the Noble Secian, Romilin the Noble Psycian (hovering 15 feet above you), Attkayet'a the Dragon (flying 15 feet above you), Chip the Secian (holding a glowing gold-flecked crystalla shard), Pollii the Secian (holding a glowing pure white crystal long-stemmed rose), Miriel the Secian, Meliya the Noble Secian, Hott the Noble Leuian, Lilyth the Noble Secian (flying beside you), Jolanar the Novice Leuian, and Relawen the Drake.

The few lone fir trees that once stood mighty in this open plain have been broken in half and thrown casually to the side. The earth has been ripped up, exposing the dark black soil underneath.

The giant hole leading into the ground reveals a dense curtain of thorny roots, surrounded by a multitude of strange symbols.  A light branch, some broken fir trees, a freshly expanded hole, a towering mound of soil, a towering mound of soil, a towering mound of soil, a towering mound of freshly dug earth, a towering mound of freshly dug earth, and a newly excavated opening are here.

The plains begin to slope upward toward the north here near the western edge of the plains.  Looking up to the north you can see the tops of snowcapped peaks beyond the foothills. You occasionally must step over rusted hunks of metal.  Hmm, what are they?  Some silver and gold etched iron gauntlets, a steaming mug of mushroom brew, some light antique bronze battle-plating, a worn leather money belt, and a closed rusty brass box are here.

This area is illuminated.
You see the 1st massive green wyvern corpse, the 1st wolf (wearing a small gold collar), and the 1st black kitten (wearing a small gold collar).

[Open plains]

The few lone fir trees that once stood mighty in this open plain have been broken in half and thrown casually to the side. The earth has been ripped up, exposing the dark black soil underneath. Several piles of grass, moss, rocks, and soil are piled in various directions, remnants of the freshly excavated ground. The giant hole leading into the ground reveals a dense curtain of thorny roots, surrounded by a multitude of strange symbols.  A light branch, some broken fir trees, a freshly expanded hole, a towering mound of soil, a towering mound of soil, a towering mound of soil, a towering mound of freshly dug earth, a towering mound of freshly dug earth, a newly excavated opening, a strange glass monocle, a small obsidian figurine, a battle scarred ebony parrying shield, a slick hardened snakeskin helm, a pair of soft brown doeskin gloves, a two-handed oak quarterstaff, an ancient jade eyed jackal sigil, a shovel, and a short black talon are here.

The few lone fir trees that once stood mighty in this open plain have been broken in half and thrown casually to the side. The earth has been ripped up, exposing the dark black soil underneath. Several piles of grass, moss, rocks, and soil are piled in various directions, remnants of the freshly excavated ground. The giant hole leading into the ground reveals a dense curtain of thorny roots, surrounded by a multitude of strange symbols.  A light branch, some broken fir trees, a freshly expanded hole, a towering mound of soil, a towering mound of soil, a towering mound of soil, a towering mound of freshly dug earth, a towering mound of freshly dug earth, a newly excavated opening, a slick hardened snakeskin helm, a pair of soft brown doeskin gloves, a two-handed oak quarterstaff, a shovel, a short pointy tipped iron letter opener, and some black and gold iron gauntlets are here.

The breeze from the north brings the scent of the mountain forest to your nose. High above, a freshly painted tree house rests in the leafy canopy darkness of trees in the area. A small welcome sign and a mailbox with the name Faraway carved into it sit next to a grand maple tree.  A large maple tree, a closed mailbox, a closed dark mahogany door, a long bent reed snorkel, a smooth pommeled carbide long sword, and a strange glass monocle are here.

The few lone fir trees that once stood mighty in this open plain have been broken in half and thrown casually to the side. The earth has been ripped up, exposing the dark black soil underneath. Several piles of grass, moss, rocks, and soil are piled in various directions, remnants of the freshly excavated ground. The giant hole leading into the ground reveals a dense curtain of thorny roots, surrounded by a multitude of strange symbols.  A light branch, some broken fir trees, a freshly expanded hole, a towering mound of soil, a towering mound of soil, a towering mound of soil, a towering mound of freshly dug earth, a towering mound of freshly dug earth, a newly excavated opening, a slick hardened snakeskin helm, a pair of soft brown doeskin gloves, a two-handed oak quarterstaff, a shovel, and a short pointy tipped iron letter opener are here.

The few lone fir trees that once stood mighty in this open plain have been broken in half and thrown casually to the side. The earth has been ripped up, exposing the dark black soil underneath.

The giant hole leading into the ground reveals a dense curtain of thorny roots, surrounded by a multitude of strange symbols.

[Open plains]

You wind your way through several mounds here, as well as stepping over a few rusty hunks of metal. The sun shines brightly on the lush grass and the plains teem with life.

Immense fir, redwood and sequoia trees block your path to the north up into the foothills. The ground here is full of rusty metal and small mounds, making the footing somewhat unstable.

Ziraxtan'a looks like a 51'11" standard 4th stage, winged massive boned, very muscular bodied black Dragon.
He is lying down.
He is bald, with golden eyes, and looks spotless.
He appears to be distant right now.
He can be attacked by other players.

On his head are enormous horns that shoot forward from in front of his fringed, spiked ear flaps. The razor-sharp tipped horns do not trail back towards the neck; rather they jut towards his diamond shaped face and curve along his jawline.

On his face are dual ridges of small hornlets that run up his face from each nostril, splitting to follow each eye ridge, and reconvening at the back of the skull. The hornlets grow in size as they ascend the face.

On his back are slender spines that run down his sinuous vertebrae. The upper half of the spines are joined by a webbed frill. The frill rises majestically from the mid of his muscled back and ends standing tall on the top the head.

On his wings are many scars that mar the bat-like, lilac-tinted skin that stretches over the alar limbs and covers the fingerlets.

He has no apparent injuries, but looks tired.

Physical appearance:

The hulking, obtuse majesty of the dragon before you commands attention. His black scales, each the size of a buckler, bulge with mass and muscle beneath. Each movement reveals a lavender tinge on the edges of his otherwise ebony scales.

Bright green leaves of clover have begun springing up through the ashy soil in conjunction with soft moss to lend a durable cushion to this well-traveled spot.

A diminutive niche in the wall provides shelter to a small family of flying squirrels. Just inside sit the young, comfortably settled into the soft bedding the parents have gathered up. A breeze carries their tiny chitters to your ears, revealing that the niche is somehow connected to the outside world as well.  A niche in the wall is here.

A large tapestry lines the outside wall of the passageway, most impressive in that it is not made of fabric, but of vines as tiny as thick hairs, growing in a weave. The delicate shadings of the plants is perfectly natural, and as the eye becomes unfocused, a picture of a diminutive, beautiful maiden sits amongst a foresty background. The wall opposite of this magnificent tapestry is lined with portraits of prominent temple leaders, the colors vibrant, bringing a life-like sense to the frames. The eyes of the maiden in the tapestry seem to follow you, staring directly as you pass, boring into your soul.  A vellum portrait, a canvas portrait, a suede portrait, some unfinished portraits, and a carefully painted silk screen are here.

A few of Temple Elindale's more enterprising clerics have set up shop here. Shelves and niches of living wood display a broad selection of religious items for clerics as well as more mundane items that any follower of Elindale might find useful. Repeated attacks on both Treehaven and Temple Elindale have left the shopkeepers a bit skittish - with thin smiles, they politely turn away customers that don't bear the mark of Elindale.

Fragrant flowers bloom in every corner of this area of the tree, the plants not in planters, mind you, but growing right into the flesh of the tree itself. The branch grew openly toward the top, allowing not only the sun and moon to cast rays down inside, but also permitting entrance to variant forms of wildlife. A ruby-throated hummingbird spends its time methodically tending to each bloom, the soft hum of its wings being almost musical. The base of the branch has grown upwards in what can only be described as inverted knots, a large one forming a table-like surface and another, smaller one, perfectly suited to resting one's bottom on.  A ledger and a closed polished rosewood temple cupboard are here.

Strange, due to the fact that they don't appear carved, painted, or put there by any hand-made means. It is as if the glyphs grew into the wood itself.

[Open plains]

The few lone fir trees that once stood mighty in this open plain have been broken in half and thrown casually to the side. The earth has been ripped up, exposing the dark black soil underneath. Several piles of grass, moss, rocks, and soil are piled in various directions, remnants of the freshly excavated ground. The giant hole leading into the ground reveals a dense curtain of thorny roots, surrounded by a multitude of strange symbols.  A light branch, some broken fir trees, a freshly expanded hole, a towering mound of soil, a towering mound of soil, a towering mound of freshly dug earth, a towering mound of freshly dug earth, a newly excavated opening, and a worn leather money belt are here.

[Open plains]

The few lone fir trees that once stood mighty in this open plain have been broken in half and thrown casually to the side. The earth has been ripped up, exposing the dark black soil underneath. Several piles of grass, moss, rocks, and soil are piled in various directions, remnants of the freshly excavated ground. The giant hole leading into the ground reveals a dense curtain of thorny roots, surrounded by a multitude of strange symbols.  A light branch and some broken fir trees are here.

Green just placed an empty clay jug of strong whiskey within his open leather healer's bag.

Ziraxtan'a looks like a 51'11" standard 4th stage, winged massive boned, very muscular bodied black Dragon.
He is lying down.
He is bald, with golden eyes, and looks spotless.
He appears to be distant right now.
He can be attacked by other players.

On his head are enormous horns that shoot forward from in front of his fringed, spiked ear flaps. The razor-sharp tipped horns do not trail back towards the neck; rather they jut towards his diamond shaped face and curve along his jawline.

On his face are dual ridges of small hornlets that run up his face from each nostril, splitting to follow each eye ridge, and reconvening at the back of the skull. The hornlets grow in size as they ascend the face.

On his back are slender spines that run down his sinuous vertebrae. The upper half of the spines are joined by a webbed frill. The frill rises majestically from the mid of his muscled back and ends standing tall on the top the head.

On his wings are many scars that mar the bat-like, lilac-tinted skin that stretches over the alar limbs and covers the fingerlets.

He appears to be in perfect health.

Physical appearance:

The hulking, obtuse majesty of the dragon before you commands attention. His black scales, each the size of a buckler, bulge with mass and muscle beneath. Each movement reveals a lavender tinge on the edges of his otherwise ebony scales.

[Pollii and Chip's Tree House.]

This large square room is made of wood and blends in naturally to the tree that is supporting it some 50 feet above the plains below. A big harvest table sits in the middle of the room surrounded by many chairs, some very  large, some very small and elevated on boxes. In the corner of the room, under a picture window, are several benches and pillows. On one wall sits a pot bellied stove, the fire crackling within it keeps a kettle perpetually at the boil and fills the room with warmth. Next to the stove stands a larder with some drying moss hanging from a nail above it. In the far corner of the room, a branch of the tree protrudes through the floor and continues through an enlarged hole in the ceiling.  A small chair, a large chair, a bench, a pillow, a closed large wrought iron stove, an open dark mahogany door, a closed larder, an open small pink door, and a glass window are here.

Several piles of grass, moss, rocks, and soil are piled in various directions, remnants of the freshly excavated ground. The giant hole leading into the ground reveals a dense curtain of thorny roots, surrounded by a multitude of strange symbols.  A light branch and some broken fir trees are here.

This area is illuminated.
You see the 1st massive green wyvern.
In the area are Linneastrylon the Noble Secian, Domi the Secian, Lilioth the Secian, Mirrdae the Drake, Aelestithiel the Noble Drake, Ceresina the Noble Secian, Chip the Secian (holding a glowing gold-flecked crystalla shard), Pollii the Secian, Miriel the Secian (holding a flaming rose petal filled moonsilver censer), Viator the Draco, Losmir the Draco, Relawen the Drake, Forsythia the Drake, Sebbien the Drake, and Gwen the Secian (flying beside you).

The few lone fir trees that once stood mighty in this open plain have been broken in half and thrown casually to the side. The earth has been ripped up, exposing the dark black soil underneath. Several piles of grass, moss, rocks, and soil are piled in various directions, remnants of the freshly excavated ground. The giant hole leading into the ground reveals a dense curtain of thorny roots, surrounded by a multitude of strange symbols.  A light branch and some broken fir trees are here.

The narrow muddy path ends at the edge of a deep blue pool. Overhead, the waters of the forest stream gush out into the frothing river. A gentler cascade trickles down the rock face of the chasm, creating a double waterfall. The hardened mud to one side of the path holds the impressions and footsteps of a struggle that occurred here, and a few scattered scales that were dislodged during the battle are becoming petrified into the surroundings by the deposits from the mist of the double waterfall. A rock shelf rests a few feet above the pool, housing an inviting combination of moss and clover.  A beautiful flowing waterfall, a deep blue pool, and a soft mossy patch of clover are here.

The narrow muddy path ends at the edge of a deep blue pool. Overhead, the waters of the forest stream gush out into the frothing river. A gentler cascade trickles down the rock face of the chasm, creating a double waterfall. The hardened mud to one side of the path holds the impressions and footsteps of a struggle that occurred here, and a few scattered scales that were dislodged during the battle are becoming petrified into the surroundings by the deposits from the mist of the double waterfall. A rock shelf rests a few feet above the pool, housing an inviting combination of moss and clover.  A beautiful flowing waterfall, a deep blue pool, a soft mossy patch of clover, and some silver coins are here.

Relawen dives out of the sky, and just as you think she will crash, she unfolds her wings and lands softly beside you.

Ziraxtan'a looks like a 51'11" standard 4th stage, winged massive boned, very muscular bodied black Dragon.
He is lying down.
He is bald, with golden eyes, and looks spotless.
He appears to be distant right now.
He can be attacked by other players.

On his head are enormous horns that shoot forward from in front of his fringed, spiked ear flaps. The razor-sharp tipped horns do not trail back towards the neck; rather they jut towards his diamond shaped face and curve along his jawline.

On his face are dual ridges of small hornlets that run up his face from each nostril, splitting to follow each eye ridge, and reconvening at the back of the skull. The hornlets grow in size as they ascend the face.

On his back are slender spines that run down his sinuous vertebrae. The upper half of the spines are joined by a webbed frill. The frill rises majestically from the mid of his muscled back and ends standing tall on the top the head.

On his wings are many scars that mar the bat-like, lilac-tinted skin that stretches over the alar limbs and covers the fingerlets.

He appears to be in perfect health.

Physical appearance:

The hulking, obtuse majesty of the dragon before you commands attention. His black scales, each the size of a buckler, bulge with mass and muscle beneath. Each movement reveals a lavender tinge on the edges of his otherwise ebony scales.

Swirls of deep blue mist begin to gather before Ceresina's fingertips.

Mirrdae's stomach growls.

The blue mist sprays forth and soothingly envelops you!

The blue mist about you slowly fades away.

Caylith dives out of the sky, and just as you think she will crash, she unfolds her wings and lands softly beside you.

Swollen beyond its banks, the once small creek is now a rushing overflowing river. What used to be the charred footbridge is now a safe haven for fish well down river, nothing left of its structure. Set well into the bank of the river is a long steel pole. Lashed to the pole is a heavy rope. The voice of the riverboat captain can be heard echoing across the water, taking command and moving his cargo.  A flowing river, a freshly painted sign, some carved oak benches, a snow angel, a pile of snow, a spent ruby tipped elm stave, and a riverboat are here.

You hear voices chattering around you but you can't see the source.  After a few moments of listening, you look up into a tree next to the path and see three Fir Elves sitting in the tree talking to each other.  They smile down at you and give you a friendly greeting.

The marsh is becoming less and less apparent, and larger trees are becoming more common. To the east you see a large forest blotting out a great deal of the sky. One tree in particular towers over all the others.

A small orb of light hovers in the center of the path before you, only to disappear as you near it, reappearing further away into the swamp. Stepping near the orb to investigate closer only causes it to again blink out of existence, forming once more, deeper into the mists. It soon becomes apparent that the mysterious lights are attempting to slyly lead you into the swamp. To or for what purpose, is the question.

Ravens dark as pitch spread their feathers to a wing-span of nearly four feet, so large they are, as they quarrel over an abandoned mule carcass on the roadside breaks out. How final death seems, so casually nature simply encompasses the bodies of the fallen, through carrion hunters or moldy decay. Yet through death there be life again, any number of these ravens being sustained through this death, so they may live. Perhaps only to become sustenance for one of the swamp creatures, who, in turn, spends its life continuing the cycle.

Eyes of creatures too quick to be seen monitor your progress along the road. Their footprints can be seen occasionally, leading back and forth across the path, sometimes following along the edges, bringing to mind the vision of something that might be following you, at this very moment, leaving tiny or perhaps not so tiny footprints along the edge of the road as it stalks its prey.

The dried trees encroach even up to the roadside, here, their limbs reaching down to the passage as if to snatch the unwary passer-by. A sudden shift in the wind brings forth the sullied aroma of death and decay from the swamp southern lands. Slurpish noises belie the path of some creature traveling through the muddy scape, their movements hidden behind the smoky mist that reduces visibility to a mere few feet past the swamp's edge.

The open plains are becoming scattered with scraggly trees, the wood of which proving inefficient to use for building as the elements of nature have grown the trunks so twisted and hard in order to withstand the onslaughts of time. Circling around the northern base of a small hill, there lies the lapping edge of the swamp to the south. Small slimy creatures lie on the smooth stones near the water, darting into it at the speed of light as you near them with tiny splashes and echoing wakes blending into the small, gentle waves coming into the shore. Swarms of mosquitoes move along the land in unison, lending them the appearance of large, unified bodies hovering around for the next feast.

A hedge of spiky brambles forms a natural division from the lands and the swampy terrain to the south. Tall, limbless trees dot the horizon there, their bases lost in the misty depths of the gases hovering over the waters. Now and then a strange, growling sound echos up to the north, or an odd, high-pitched call of some unseen crow, probably feasting on a fallen creature hidden in the mists. The path curves away from the sounds, as popular choice has preferred to travel around the edges, rather than through the marshy sludge.

[Southern Tradeway.]

Only the well-built, stone tradeway gives any hint of civilization ever having had any presence here. The tall grasses limit visibility nearby, hiding any wildlife that may be waiting for prey to stumble too close. A few blades of grass sway slightly in the breeze, some of them broken by the passing of something heavy over them. One of the larger stones in the road, broken loose from its mortar, waits patiently to be repaired.

The grass rises taller and taller in every direction further limiting view just off the roadside. A second glance reveals that this is the lowest point in a large, shallow depression. The tradeway sinks a little lower as it gets closer to the river off to the west. A ditch runs alongside the river's side of the road, small puddles of water filling the bottom. Trickles filter into the puddles from the grass beyond as mosquitoes dart across the muddy surfaces.

Rising up out of the plains, a large walled fort receives the end of the stone road. The river flows from either side, running through the fort from this angle of view. The vegetation surrounding the tradeway at this point has been burned out recently, allowing a clear field of vision from the tops of the walls ahead. The stones show little wear from the heavy traffic of feet and wheels alike; it has certainly been well constructed.

Two guards patrol above the gate, looking you over carefully before giving leave to pass through the heavy wood gate. Thick and long wooden ladders serve up to the guard's posts high in the sky so that they may have some relief from their duties overlooking the land and city. Through the slates of the wooden walkways, you can make out four archers playing a game of cards, weapons at the ready. A whip cracks loudly as a caravan heads out the gate towards Spur.  A glowing wrought iron lantern is here.

[Meetpoint Square.]

Within the heart of this proud fort one can see all around that the reconstruction of its buildings has begun. Large stones and logs have been stacked and piled, while some workers tirelessly attempt to repair the damage that occurred here during the Lords of Chaos wars. The buildings and homes of the people that resided here are slowly taking shape, though, far from completed. The smell of dyes, used to paint the town, permeate the area.  A breathtaking shimmering bouquet of moonflowers, an open light blue door, and a glowing wrought iron street lantern are here.

Here a gate leads out of the fort and into the Southern regions. Several children run and play just inside the gate, under the watchful eyes of the guards. What was once a very well used trade route has slowed to some caravans bringing supplies for the townsmen and the occasional merchants traveling from the far southern reaches of the land. Many guards protect this section of the fort as it is home to some wild beasts that live outside these walls. In the distance, you can make out two more guards hunting the frogmen that often try to attack the city and caravans.  An open large sturdy wooden gate and a glowing wrought iron lantern are here.

A few guards do a roving patrol of the area and down to the bridge. They check the caravans before they enter and anyone that looks suspicious they throw into the river. They seem quite wary of anyone coming or going to and from the city. From their appearance it would seem best to stay on their good sides and hope that they are in good moods.  An open large sturdy wooden gate and a stone bridge are here.

With Meetpoint at your heels this rugged old cobblestone bridge leads to the Southern Plains and the main trade routes from spur and Meetpoint to the Southernmost reaches of the lands. Signs that this road was once well traveled by the hustle and bustle of laden carts are plain to view. Though, with the hardened clay-like mud and the fact that it has not rained here in some time it is obvious that these tracks are very old.

In the area are Caylith the Drake and Mirrdae the Drake.
Obvious paths: north southeast southwest*.

The path seems to be disappearing before your very eyes. Travel any way but back to the northwest is blocked by foliage so dense as to prevent any further passage into the forest. An ancient oak tree festooned with bright colorful silk ribbons stands to the side of the disappearing path. Sparkling trinkets and gems hang from every available branch, a  cheerful tinkling noise filling the air with the slightest breeze.  A giant ancient oak tree, a fragrant bluish Secian rose, a tiny oak knothole, some swirling multicolored paper hanging lanterns, some flowing colorful paper streamers, an elegant crystal platter of treats, an elegant silver platter, and a huge soft cotton picnic blanket are here.

Colorful woven silk rugs cover the sparkling polished oak floor of this large cavernous room in the center of the ancient tree. Large soft silk-covered feather pillows lay scattered about the floor, and a shimmering crystal fountain sits in the center of the chamber. A beautiful mural has been painted on one wall and adds even more color to the room.  A blue and white silken rope leading up, a tiny oak knothole, a soft blue and white velvet sofa, a soft green silk pillow, a soft red silk pillow, a soft yellow silk pillow, and a soft blue silk pillow are here.

A gentle feeling of peace and serenity drifts through this cozy room, and the light-hearted sound of birds singing in the forest around the great tree adds a wondrous music that could never be imitated.  Soft feather-filled pallets just the right sizes for Secians to sleep on rest in different spots around the room.  A blue and white silken rope leading down, a small opening in the branches, a soft pallet, a soft pallet, a soft pallet, a soft pallet, and some shimmering mirrors are here.
