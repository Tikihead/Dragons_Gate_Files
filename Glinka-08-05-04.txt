By torchlight or daylight, the windows of this shop sparkle from the many faceted stones inside. The sight almost makes one forget the presence of two Thugian guards and their war dogs guarding the entrance. The etched window glass indicates this is Fredriquede Tiffany's place of business, widely regarded as the finest jeweler in the land.  An engraved marble plaque and an open banded steelwood door are here.

[Market Circle.]

An arch between two large buildings connects Market Circle and Market Street. The more reputable shopkeepers do business within the circle, but pay higher taxes for the privilege. The buildings have been built to last, as these merchants are no traveling tinkers. Interlocking stone walkways and colorful plantings span this central area. Despite the number of animals waiting outside the bank for their owners, the area is spotless. Loud chatter in many languages can be heard from the southwest.  A marble archway, an open elegant gold-trimmed walnut door, and a wooden sign are here.

Situated between the well-traveled Trade Way to the north and the fine shops of Market Circle to the south, this small stretch of road is busy at all times of day. Adventurers with sacks of plundered goods leave Market Street and head west. A shrewd businessman has set up shop in this busy area of the Market District.  A street lantern is here.

The buildings of Market Circle stand to the south. It becomes obvious that the area through the arch is a much cleaner marketplace than the bazaar. An inviting eatery stands beside the road, its door open to those weary after a long trip to Spur, as well as those preparing to venture to the great expanses beyond the west gate. A human couple exit the building, arm in arm. A small sign stands beside the intersection.  A sign, an open glossy lacquered oak door, and a street lantern are here.

Many townsfolk pass along this busy thoroughfare. Rich and poor alike mix freely on this street, much to the dismay of a passing nobleman.

Merchant Walk comes to an abrupt end at a massive moonsilver gate. The towering walls of Spur on either side of the gates force all to pass by the guards who are constantly on the watch for thieves and bandits.

Several city guardsmen have just finished wrestling to the ground some young tough thieves, who thought to rob one of the returning merchants.

[Town Square Center.]

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.   A flowing white marble fountain, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a marble statue of a Human, a carved marble statue of a Dragon, and a rosewood sign are here.

[Town Square South.]

The outward appearance of the people here seems a bit classier. Rich clothing and large coin purses are prevalent amongst the travelers. In fact, many of the folk heading into Town Square from the south are accompanied by large bodyguards to assure their safety. The well maintained road is lined with small brass lanterns, each swinging off an individual pole. No expense has been spared to keep those who travel this road safe from the hoodlums that relish the darkness.  A street lantern and some charred foliage are here.

Vast estates tower over the huge Spurian wall towards the south. The well-to-do who live in these homes idle away their days, enjoying the luxury of time. Standing next to a very empty lantern pole, a small Flerian child insists in a plaintive wail, that he had nothing to do with the missing lantern. The well-dressed guard that interrogates him keeps pointing at a small sack on the ground and its obvious contents.  An open small burlap sack and a street lantern are here.

The boughs of a large apple tree hang over the well tended avenue. Below the beautiful tree stands a small fountain. Atop the fountain is an intricately carved Secian who appears to be dancing with the water as it splashes around her. Set in the marble base is a small plaque that reads, "For those who have gone before us." Many stand for a moment as they pass this way, giving thanks for the gift of life that is given by both the apple tree and the Secians of long ago. Large piles of dirt and broken stone lay on either side of the street as workmen ready the east and west alleys for expansion.  A street lantern, a Secian etched moonsilver door, a pair of open silver forged swinging doors, and a sign above the doors are here.

Standing next to the large iron gate that separates the center of town from those of the elite class are several of the Spurian Guard. They are here to assist all who pass with the simple kindness of opening a gate, or the more important task of escorting those in need to the bank or market. A young looking cadet rubs wax into the stones of the city wall, his task is daunting, but one that will teach him discipline.  An open iron gate and a street lantern are here.

An unusually large home, even for this part of town, lies off to the west. It seems as if one ambitious owner is slowly buying up the lots next to his and adding them to his own.

The occasional locked gate marks the entrance to some of the more hidden estates of Spurs nobility. From this broad avenue, little can be seen of their splendor. Behind the imposing gate recedes a proud drive, disappearing mysteriously into the trees. If not for the large imposing tower rising above the hedges it would be hard to discern anything was beyond the gate. It is apparent the residents do not wish to be disturbed.

Through the gate lies the city of Spur, the major center of trade and civilization on the plains. The dusty road leading through the gates is well traveled, and walls of the city are in good repair. A small shack sits to the west of the road, during most times of the day a dusty coach can be seen waiting in front, its horses stomping with impatience to be gone. To the right of the door is a small window, its opening covered with metal bars.

Through the gate lies the city of Spur, the major center of trade and civilization on the plains. The dusty road leading through the gates is well traveled, and walls of the city are in good repair. A small shack sits to the west of the road, during most times of the day a dusty coach can be seen waiting in front, its horses stomping with impatience to be gone. To the right of the door is a small window, its opening covered with metal bars.

Tall, limbless trees dot the horizon there, their bases lost in the misty depths of the gases hovering over the waters. Now and then a strange, growling sound echos up to the north, or an odd, high-pitched call of some unseen crow, probably feasting on a fallen creature hidden in the mists. The path curves away from the sounds, as popular choice has preferred to travel around the edges, rather than through the marshy sludge.

Small slimy creatures lie on the smooth stones near the water, darting into it at the speed of light as you near them with tiny splashes and echoing wakes blending into the small, gentle waves coming into the shore. Swarms of mosquitoes move along the land in unison, lending them the appearance of large, unified bodies hovering around for the next feast.

How final death seems, so casually nature simply encompasses the bodies of the fallen, through carrion hunters or moldy decay. Yet through death there be life again, any number of these ravens being sustained through this death, so they may live. Perhaps only to become sustenance for one of the swamp creatures, who, in turn, spends its life continuing the cycle.

A small orb of light hovers in the center of the path before you, only to disappear as you near it, reappearing further away into the swamp. Stepping near the orb to investigate closer only causes it to again blink out of existence, forming once more, deeper into the mists. It soon becomes apparent that the mysterious lights are attempting to slyly lead you into the swamp. To or for what purpose, is the question.

The footbridge that once connected this path to its match on the other side of the overflowing rushing river is now nothing more then a few charred pilings. Tiny insects buzz around their remains, finding a comfortable new home. Lashed to the remains of one of the more sturdy pilings is a tall steel pole. Wrapped around the pole, and tied securely is a taut rope. Bobbing ever so lightly due to the strain of the riverboat, the rope holds tight.  A flowing river, a freshly painted sign, and some carved oak benches are here.

A small winding path of stones placed in the shape of four leaf clovers winds itself through the forest.  A small winding stone pathway and a charred flowering steelwood tree are here.

The small shack is set back from the road, its walls built of a whitewashed birch. A sturdy corral, filled with well-fed horses, stands to the left of the shack. A matched pair of dapple grays stand in front of the shack waiting to take their human baggage to their destination. To the left of the door, behind a small paned window, a beautiful Fir Elf female takes coin and in return, with a charming smile, directs those who have paid their fare into the waiting room.  A small shack, a freshly painted sign, a notice of non-refund, and a small winding stone pathway are here.

Carefully winding its way up the base of the tree, and wrapping itself around the stairs, a flowering jasmine vine grows tall and lush. Dark scars from a past fire are almost hidden under tufts of fresh growth and moss. A large gap, nearly sixteen feet in distance, rests between the base of a set of stairs and the forest floor. A long moonsilver cord hangs down the side of the tree. If one pulls it, the long Elven rope will descend from above, allowing them to enter the great city of Treehaven. Bright green leaves of clover have begun springing up through the ashy soil in conjunction with soft moss to lend a durable cushion to this well-traveled spot.  Some vine-covered steps circling the tree, a freshly painted wooden sign, a healthy green patch of clover, a flowing marble fountain, some clover shaped stones, some sweet scented flowering jasmine vines, and a long woven moonsilver cord are here.

The latticework surrounding and covering the spiral staircase is finely crafted. The intertwining beams seem to weave a delicate pattern above you, accenting the view of the forest floor. Soft, new, growth can be seen all over the forest below. A small mound of moss has slowly begun to cover the old inn, creating a fuzzy green mound. A large pile of Elven rope sits near the silent Golem. This creature of Elindale helps defend the city by retrieving the rope that people have pushed down to the forest below.  Some steps circling the tree and a freshly carved wooden sign are here.

Four sturdy walls and a roof of woven branches enclose this small tavern. From the forest floor, winding their way around the trunk of the Mother Tree, a set of intricately railed steps serve as the entrance and exit of the town of Treehaven. Strangers arriving at the top of the steps find themselves under the watchful eye of patrons seated at tables positioned about the light, airy room. A set of oak steps lead up to the new Council chambers.  An ivory inlaid pine bar, a wooden stool, a long weathered wooden bench, a long musty wooden table, some steps circling the tree, some freshly crafted oak steps, an open door, a paper covered posting board, and a gilt framed painting on the wall are here.

[Treehaven, Main Platform]

The branches of this tree have begun to grow through the wooden platform. The limbs have begun to twist and turn, forming their own natural base. Soft leaves create a cushion and boast several small buds. The former bank is almost completely covered by vines and moss. Intricately crafted stairs lead from the platform to the new building that resides in the upper branches.  An open door and a freshly painted wooden sign are here.

New wooden planks fit side by side creating the walkway that extends proudly upon the reconstructed supports. The view of the forest to the northwest is quite panoramic, despite the burnt spikes of trees in the midst. A staircase here seems to have some enchantment, judging by the strange appearance of unicorns, bears and owls on the lower steps. Strange, due to the fact that they don't appear carved, painted, or put there by any hand-made means. It is as if the glyphs grew into the wood itself. Mysterious symbols are scattered throughout the portraits, which shimmer with a golden whisper as they are approached.

This is the main entrance of a Temple of Elindale, the inside walls perfectly smooth with glowing magickal symbols upon the surfaces.

A large tapestry lines the outside wall of the passageway, most impressive in that it is not made of fabric, but of vines as tiny as thick hairs, growing in a weave. The delicate shadings of the plants is perfectly natural, and as the eye becomes unfocused, a picture of a diminutive, beautiful maiden sits amongst a foresty background. The wall opposite of this magnificent tapestry is lined with portraits of prominent temple leaders, the colors vibrant, bringing a life-like sense to the frames. The eyes of the maiden in the tapestry seem to follow you, staring directly as you pass, boring into your soul.  A vellum portrait, a canvas portrait, a suede portrait, some unfinished portraits, and a carefully painted silk screen are here.

While the tree appears gigantic from the outside, it still is nothing compared to the impression of being on the inside. Hollow branches large enough to pass a drake branch out here, the surfaces smooth, but in a most curious way. It is apparent that no tools were used to create these passageways, yet there is no evidence to give one the impression that the passageways formed over a long period of time. The branches have grown in this manner intentionally, quite unlike any plantlife found anywhere on the land.

The hum of busy bees and hummingbirds add a tone of unity to the soft chants of the priests and murmurings of those here to offer up the sacrifices and tithes to the great Goddess, Elindale. Several monks wearing floor length robes sit in silence, with the occasional clasped hands rising up in a particularly vibrant part of prayer. The altar itself is composed of growing flowers, the tiny buds enclosing gems and gold alike. Around the base of the altar grows a ring of mushrooms, vibrantly cloaked in red with white spots dotting the umbrellas.

[Elindale's Temple.]

While the tree appears gigantic from the outside, it still is nothing compared to the impression of being on the inside. Hollow branches large enough to pass a drake branch out here, the surfaces smooth, but in a most curious way. It is apparent that no tools were used to create these passageways, yet there is no evidence to give one the impression that the passageways formed over a long period of time. The branches have grown in this manner intentionally, quite unlike any plantlife found anywhere on the land.

Ceresina asks, "But not all of these have been found here right?"

You follow Caylith west...

[Elindale's Temple, Research Library.]

The walls have grown out short, flat surfaces to serve as bookshelves. Small branches spring out of the shelves themselves to provide rests, holding up the many stacks of books collected here. The glory of Elindale can be found, scribed into these pages, as well as other points of interest. Historical novels, books of lore and tomes of knowledge are available for the temple registry to peruse. Any time spent here could prove to teach anyone something they haven't yet learned, or at the very least, one might study the tomes to learn better how to do that which they already know.  An open gilt edged leather book and a smooth oak bookshelf are here.

You follow Caylith northeast...

[Elindale's Temple.]

A large tapestry lines the outside wall of the passageway, most impressive in that it is not made of fabric, but of vines as tiny as thick hairs, growing in a weave. The delicate shadings of the plants is perfectly natural, and as the eye becomes unfocused, a picture of a diminutive, beautiful maiden sits amongst a foresty background. The wall opposite of this magnificent tapestry is lined with portraits of prominent temple leaders, the colors vibrant, bringing a life-like sense to the frames. The eyes of the maiden in the tapestry seem to follow you, staring directly as you pass, boring into your soul.  A vellum portrait, a canvas portrait, a suede portrait, some unfinished portraits, and a carefully painted silk screen are here.

[Elindale's Temple.]

A diminutive niche in the wall provides shelter to a small family of flying squirrels. Just inside sit the young, comfortably settled into the soft bedding the parents have gathered up. A breeze carries their tiny chitters to your ears, revealing that the niche is somehow connected to the outside world as well.  A niche in the wall is here.

[Elindale's Temple.]

Encircling the innards of this tree, these steps coil clock-wise to the top, the entire environment one single living thing. There are no cracks, no signs of building. Tapestries on the wall appear life-like, suspended with no visible attachments.  A breathtaking tapestry is here.

[Elindale's Temple.]

This is the main entrance of a Temple of Elindale, the inside walls perfectly smooth with glowing magickal symbols upon the surfaces. The enormity of this tree becomes apparent as one travels up the stairs to the northwest. The air holds a fresh, new ambiance, pleasantly scented with sweet sap and rich, earthly undertones.  Some glowing magickal symbols and a brown oak staircase are here.

You follow Caylith through a brown oak staircase...

[Treehaven, Main Platform]

New wooden planks fit side by side creating the walkway that extends proudly upon the reconstructed supports. The view of the forest to the northwest is quite panoramic, despite the burnt spikes of trees in the midst. A staircase here seems to have some enchantment, judging by the strange appearance of unicorns, bears and owls on the lower steps. Strange, due to the fact that they don't appear carved, painted, or put there by any hand-made means. It is as if the glyphs grew into the wood itself. Mysterious symbols are scattered throughout the portraits, which shimmer with a golden whisper as they are approached.

You follow Caylith south...

[Treehaven, Main Platform]

Leaves and small twigs spot the walkway as it hugs against the trunk of the Mother Tree. New sprouts from the branches above hang softly over the wooden planks, shading it slightly. A large building rests gently against the trunk in the limbs above, nestled as though it grew from within the tree itself.  An oak ladder is here.

[Treehaven, Main Platform]

The branches of this tree have begun to grow through the wooden platform. The limbs have begun to twist and turn, forming their own natural base. Soft leaves create a cushion and boast several small buds. The former bank is almost completely covered by vines and moss. Intricately crafted stairs lead from the platform to the new building that resides in the upper branches.  An open door and a freshly painted wooden sign are here.

[Gaspar's Grog and Grub.]

Four sturdy walls and a roof of woven branches enclose this small tavern. From the forest floor, winding their way around the trunk of the Mother Tree, a set of intricately railed steps serve as the entrance and exit of the town of Treehaven. Strangers arriving at the top of the steps find themselves under the watchful eye of patrons seated at tables positioned about the light, airy room. A set of oak steps lead up to the new Council chambers.  An ivory inlaid pine bar, a wooden stool, a long weathered wooden bench, a long musty wooden table, some steps circling the tree, some freshly crafted oak steps, an open door, a paper covered posting board, and a gilt framed painting on the wall are here.

[New Treehaven Bank]

The smell of freshly cut lumber fills the large lobby of the newly finished bank.  The roof is a collage of intertwined branches and their leaves from above, with a delicately crafted wooden lattice frame set with glass panels just beneath.  The trunk of the Mother tree serves as the back wall of the bank, with the tellers sitting at booths just in front of it.  Some freshly crafted wooden stairs are here.

The roof is a collage of intertwined branches and their leaves from above, with a delicately crafted wooden lattice frame set with glass panels just beneath.  The trunk of the Mother tree serves as the back wall of the bank, with the tellers sitting at booths just in front of it.  Some freshly crafted wooden stairs are here.

This room is illuminated.
In the room are Caylith the Drake, Binx the Secian (holding a glowing hand-painted glass shadow box), Ceresina the Noble Secian, Romilin the Noble Psycian, Aceris the Leuian, and Aradeia the Leuian.

[Treehaven, Main Platform]

The branches of this tree have begun to grow through the wooden platform. The limbs have begun to twist and turn, forming their own natural base. Soft leaves create a cushion and boast several small buds. The former bank is almost completely covered by vines and moss. Intricately crafted stairs lead from the platform to the new building that resides in the upper branches.  An open door and a freshly painted wooden sign are here.

This area is illuminated.
You see the 1st mottled green and brown monitor lizard (wearing a small gold collar) and the 1st orange and black spotted, winged faecat (wearing a small gold collar).
Obvious paths: northeast* west*.

Leaves and small twigs spot the walkway as it hugs against the trunk of the Mother Tree. New sprouts from the branches above hang softly over the wooden planks, shading it slightly. A large building rests gently against the trunk in the limbs above, nestled as though it grew from within the tree itself.  An oak ladder is here.

This area is illuminated.

>[Treehaven, Main Platform]

New wooden planks fit side by side creating the walkway that extends proudly upon the reconstructed supports. The view of the forest to the northwest is quite panoramic, despite the burnt spikes of trees in the midst. A staircase here seems to have some enchantment, judging by the strange appearance of unicorns, bears and owls on the lower steps. Strange, due to the fact that they don't appear carved, painted, or put there by any hand-made means. It is as if the glyphs grew into the wood itself. Mysterious symbols are scattered throughout the portraits, which shimmer with a golden whisper as they are approached.

You see the 1st shadowless firian citizen.

This is the main entrance of a Temple of Elindale, the inside walls perfectly smooth with glowing magickal symbols upon the surfaces. The enormity of this tree becomes apparent as one travels up the stairs to the northwest. The air holds a fresh, new ambiance, pleasantly scented with sweet sap and rich, earthly undertones.  Some glowing magickal symbols and a brown oak staircase are here.

Encircling the innards of this tree, these steps coil clock-wise to the top, the entire environment one single living thing. There are no cracks, no signs of building. Tapestries on the wall appear life-like, suspended with no visible attachments.  A breathtaking tapestry is here.

This room is illuminated.
Obvious exits: northeast* southeast*.

A diminutive niche in the wall provides shelter to a small family of flying squirrels. Just inside sit the young, comfortably settled into the soft bedding the parents have gathered up. A breeze carries their tiny chitters to your ears, revealing that the niche is somehow connected to the outside world as well.  A niche in the wall is here.

A large tapestry lines the outside wall of the passageway, most impressive in that it is not made of fabric, but of vines as tiny as thick hairs, growing in a weave. The delicate shadings of the plants is perfectly natural, and as the eye becomes unfocused, a picture of a diminutive, beautiful maiden sits amongst a foresty background. The wall opposite of this magnificent tapestry is lined with portraits of prominent temple leaders, the colors vibrant, bringing a life-like sense to the frames. The eyes of the maiden in the tapestry seem to follow you, staring directly as you pass, boring into your soul.  A vellum portrait, a canvas portrait, a suede portrait, some unfinished portraits, and a carefully painted silk screen are here.

While the tree appears gigantic from the outside, it still is nothing compared to the impression of being on the inside. Hollow branches large enough to pass a drake branch out here, the surfaces smooth, but in a most curious way. It is apparent that no tools were used to create these passageways, yet there is no evidence to give one the impression that the passageways formed over a long period of time. The branches have grown in this manner intentionally, quite unlike any plantlife found anywhere on the land.

The hum of busy bees and hummingbirds add a tone of unity to the soft chants of the priests and murmurings of those here to offer up the sacrifices and tithes to the great Goddess, Elindale. Several monks wearing floor length robes sit in silence, with the occasional clasped hands rising up in a particularly vibrant part of prayer. The altar itself is composed of growing flowers, the tiny buds enclosing gems and gold alike. Around the base of the altar grows a ring of mushrooms, vibrantly cloaked in red with white spots dotting the umbrellas.  A blooming altar of flowers and a red and white ring of mushrooms are here.
