A lone carrion bird seems to stare from the branches of a gnarled old tree. The road surface alternates between the usual hard-packed dirt covered in gravel, and solid rock. The terrain creates even more difficult travel for those heading north or south. A large pile of broken wagons, barrels, and boxes lie quite some distance below. Many skeletons of pack animals, picked clean by carrion birds, are also discernible. It is highly likely some of the bones are Humanoid as well.

Just to the south is the juncture where old merchant road connected to this new road. Just beyond that is the deep gorge that has swallowed up the old road. The road surface is a stable solid rock, but is barely large enough for a single wagon to pass through. Unlike the new merchant road to the southwest, this road follows a more natural flow up the eastern cliffside carefully traversing the steep mountain. A single yellow wildflower grows defiantly out of the rocky cliff, giving a stark contrast to the solid grey that surrounds it.  A small yellow wildflower is here.

The cliffs to the south fall away just for a brief instant at this point on the trail. Two picturesque snow-capped mountain peaks come together in the distance for a lower pass through their forested bases. The white glint of a distant waterfall glistens amongst the green backdrop. The granite road below you continues its precarious trek eastward up the cliffside.

Despite the fact the cliffs to the north are nearly vertical, various plants still cling to life against them. Many are common weeds or merely grasses, but some are delicate wildflowers, leaving little or no explanation as to their presence on the cliff. One small tree is also attempting to take root along the cliffside, its branches jutting out at odd angles.  An oddly shaped rosewood tree is here.

The cliff face to the north is slightly more sloped than others, allowing far more vegetation to grow on it. Small shapes are visible scurrying about among the grasses and shrubs, most of them reacting to any movement on the road. A few are visible up the road ahead, but quickly vanish at the distant screech of a raptor. It is a few moments before they curiously return.  Some small cute striped chipmunks are here.

The poor construction of this road becomes quickly evident. Water is flowing down over the sides of the cliff above and across the road surface. Due to the slight slope of the road toward the deep chasm to the south, this section of road is quite hazardous. Many broken pieces of rope and metal spikes are strewn all over the pathway; evidently failed attempts to keep wagons from sliding over the side. Large piles of heavy looking stones have now been stacked along the edge of the gorge in hopes it will prevent trade carts from careening off the edge. Several of these stones seem to be missing. Evidently the idea is not working as well as was hoped.  A large pile of stones and a large pile of stones are here.

A large pile of unexplained wooden crates and barrels have been tossed unceremoniously in an alcove off the side of the main road. They have all been scavenged long ago and simply lie abandoned by their owners. For hundreds of feet in either direction, the road surface is covered in deep grooves, making wagon travel quite hazardous. Even at a slow pace the vibrations are intense enough to damage cargo. This is made evident as a heavily laden wagon shudders down the slope. Swearing loudly, the merchant tosses what sounds like a crate full of broken glass into the alcove before continuing onward.  A pile of wooden crates and barrels is here.

A large gap in the roadway is now spanned by a rickety looking wood and rope bridge. The slats seem to be spaced just close enough so that a wagon wheel does not get lodged between them. The remnants of the foundations of an old stone bridge are evident on both sides of this gap. A few hundred feet below the present bridge, the former one is visible in several pieces. Considering the state of the old bridge, this unstable replacement does not exactly inspire feelings of safety.  A decrepit looking wood and rope bridge is here.

Several large cracks split the roads surface at odd angles, threatening to swallow unwary travelers. Large and very unsteady wooden boards have been placed across the gaps, creating makeshift bridges. Many of the boards have a significant curve to them, suggesting that they may have been the victim of a rather large traveler.

A large pile of animal carcasses in various stages of decay is situated on a precarious ledge halfway up the cliff face. Bloody footprints from some sort of predatory animal are plainly visible along the edge of the path, providing a bit of insight into the decaying animal remains. The road reaches the top of the cliff up the gentle slope to the east.  Some greying oak planks are here.

There is an extremely large crevasse in the roadway that would normally prevent any further travel along this road. Astoundingly, someone has constructed a very sturdy looking bridge using two perfectly chiseled granite blocks. The blocks make up the support for the bridge structure, which is also constructed of chiseled granite slabs. There is seemingly no explanation for the excellent condition of this stretch of the road.  A sturdy granite bridge is here.

The cliff face to the north is wet, but there is no apparent source of the moisture. A slight overhang also creates a near permanent shadow in the area, providing a perfect atmosphere for the dense lichen that covers the rocks. Sporadic tufts of grass futilely attempt to assert themselves against the multi-colored lichen, but the spongy fungus prevails. Strange looking spiders scurry about amongst the lichen-covered rocks, before disappearing over the top of the cliff.

A large number of horses, carts, and merchants are congregated off the side of the road. They are either preparing for the journey down the cliff to the southwest, or are resting from the trip in the opposite direction. A dangerously high cliff is visible to the south, while to the east a flat plateau leads the roadway between two large mountains. The green hue of a forest is just visible between them.

The road is almost non-existent. The many large granite boulders that cover the path evidence the instability of the mountains to the north and south. The merchants who travel this road have erected a series of shoddy road signs to direct travelers safely around the boulders. Several of these signs point away from a shadowy area just off the side of the road. The rocks of the area seem to hang over the road slightly, blocking out the light. Light colored stringy material is barely visible along the side of the path.  A flimsy wooden sign, a flimsy wooden sign, and a craggy overhang are here.

The merchant road ascends slightly to the east as it travels between two mountain peaks. Up the slopes to the north and south is a dense forest with massive red barked trees. Closer to the path, the forest begins to thin out and only a few trees have established themselves close to the road. The merchants who made this road did not bother to go around one of the largest, which is situated directly in the middle of the path.  An ancient towering rosewood tree is here.

The tranquil terrain has been torn asunder to the northwest. One of the forces of nature has caused a great fissure to open in the earth. Although the fissure slopes downward at a severe angle, the terrain is surprisingly smooth and could be navigated even by a goods-loaded wagon. To the east a great deal of grass is growing on the road itself. It almost seems as if no one has used that road in a while.

The vicious rend that created this pathway reaches its lowest point here, drastically sloping upward in both directions. Massive walls of constantly shifting rock and earth stand a few hundred feet in the air to the southwest and the northeast.

Large conifers, capable of withstanding the dry climate, sparsely populate the hill to the south. Visible among the tops of the trees are several majestic red-tailed Rathanian hawks. The screech of the hawks fills the air, as they hunt their small furry prey from above.

A large gap between two large hills to the north and west offers safe passage through this hilly terrain. A cold wind out of the northwest blows stiffly, whipping up the dust. The ground is so dry that most of the topsoil is easily pulled off by the strong winds. Large angry clouds of dust move back and forth throughout the area, wreaking havoc on the eyes and lungs of any that dare to pass through them.  A large thick cloud of dust is here.

There is quite a bit of debris on the road in that direction. A family of prairie dogs has dug a series of holes a few meters from the road. One is constantly on watch, attempting to keep the family safe from harm. At the slightest noise, it scurries back into its hole and out of sight.  An animal made hole is here.

Various small streamlets are visible running down a few of the surrounding snow-capped peaks, ensuring that the icy lake will remain filled.

Rough granite walls rise above you to the east and west. The area here is a bit rougher and seems to have been recently mined. Large veins of silver can be seen. Up overhead, on the western face of the gorge wall a large crack has appeared. Though large enough to fit a Thugian, the only thing exiting the crack is a steady stream of dripping water.

Lush green bushes, and small trees dot the landscape, mingling with large boulders and smaller rocks.  A large pile of rocks is here.

A strong breeze blows off the mountains of the Great Divide. It both slows your climb and encourages your decent into the valley.

The trail winds around the large fallen tree. Smaller saplings, and fungus grows in the soil that is being enriched by the decaying tree. Several rocks dot the newly carved trail around the tree, making travel difficult. It is fairly certain many have cursed the falling of this great tree, and subsequent detour.

A makeshift path has been created to circumvent the large tree that has fallen down and blocked the regular path. Lying on its side, the log stands two heads higher then the tallest Thugian.

A carpet of needles covers the path. Pine cones, larger then a Thugian fist, dot the ground. Enormous trees collide with large boulders blocking you from venturing too deep into the overgrown wood.

Only the hardiest of life forms hold their own on the rocky steppes. Small cascades of icy water stream down the boulders and darken their surfaces. Tough lichen and scrub pines absorb nutrients from the mineral laden run-off. The sun shines brightly on the southern exposure of the trail, sheltered from the wind and freezing cold. Bright green oases of life sprout from rocky niches and the path is slippery where the green slimy growths cross it.

Huge boulders have created a bowl shaped depression in this sheltered hillock. A stand of scruffy trees continues to eke out a tenuous existence above the rocky outpost; their long tortured roots clinging desperately to what little soil is caught between the boulders. Prevailing winds from the mountaintop have caused the trunks to lean westward, the upper branches creating a canopy over the area.

Beneath the trees, many a caravan has stopped to water their draft animals and rest for the night. The area is strewn with animal refuse, bits of feed, and the resulting lingering aroma. The discarded feed and rubbish left by the travelers is picked over constantly by the hillock's inhabitants. In such a harsh environment, very little waste is left by the local scavengers.

The flow of the spring must be constantly replenishing the pool, for no algae or slime clouds its depths.  A small crystal clear pool is here.

A lean-to built from odds and ends serves as a way station for exhausted travelers. Gathered firewood lines the lean-to's walls, and a small darkened pit smolders outside the opening. Inside the small, cramped lean-to, light filters in through the makeshift construction.

A sheltered hillock covered by scraggly trees is visible to the northeast. The trees shade a large pool, and a makeshift lean-to is visible in the clearing.

A lean-to built from odds and ends serves as a way station for exhausted travelers. Gathered firewood lines the lean-to's walls, and a small darkened pit smolders outside the opening. Inside the small, cramped lean-to, light filters in through the makeshift construction. The possibility of being snowed in and sheltering for a long period in this little hovel is not a welcome proposition.

The boulders bear scars from deeply driven pinions and screws used to hold cables and reins, or perhaps impromptu corrals for the portage animals. The paths that enter and exit the haven are narrow and strewn with small but heavy rocks. Any wagons drawn this far would have to be manhandled over them using cables, levers, or wedges.

A small spring fed stream meanders around the bowl, filling a pool on the western side of the path. A series of miniature waterfalls gurgle delightfully along the edges of the camp. The resulting pool is quite deep and crystal clear, even with the constant watering of pack animals. The flow of the spring must be constantly replenishing the pool, for no algae or slime clouds its depths.  A small crystal clear pool is here.

Beneath the trees, many a caravan has stopped to water their draft animals and rest for the night. The area is strewn with animal refuse, bits of feed, and the resulting lingering aroma. The discarded feed and rubbish left by the travelers is picked over constantly by the hillock's inhabitants. In such a harsh environment, very little waste is left by the local scavengers.

Huge boulders have created a bowl shaped depression in this sheltered hillock. A stand of scruffy trees continues to eke out a tenuous existence above the rocky outpost; their long tortured roots clinging desperately to what little soil is caught between the boulders. Prevailing winds from the mountaintop have caused the trunks to lean westward, the upper branches creating a canopy over the area.

The stark terrain is impressive in its scope and austerity. One cannot help but feel insignificant and temporary amid the expanse of granite and limestone formed through the millennia. Washed by rain, scorched by the sun and frozen by storms, the rocks endure, a testament to the strength of the Great Divide.

Only the hardiest of life forms hold their own on the rocky steppes. Small cascades of icy water stream down the boulders and darken their surfaces. Tough lichen and scrub pines absorb nutrients from the mineral laden run-off. The sun shines brightly on the southern exposure of the trail, sheltered from the wind and freezing cold. Bright green oases of life sprout from rocky niches and the path is slippery where the green slimy growths cross it.

A lone tree stump is situated along the side of the path, providing a good rest stop for the weary traveler.  A rare red dragon-lily is here.

Several tall rosewood trees litter the area. Just to the south is a small cliff no more than ten feet high, off of which flows a tiny picturesque waterfall. The multiple footprints in the area suggest this is a popular stopping point for travelers. After hitting the ground, the crystal clear water vanishes among the rocks.

The merchant road ascends slightly to the east as it travels between two mountain peaks. Up the slopes to the north and south is a dense forest with massive red barked trees. Closer to the path, the forest begins to thin out and only a few trees have established themselves close to the road. The merchants who made this road did not bother to go around one of the largest, which is situated directly in the middle of the path.  An ancient towering rosewood tree is here.

The road is almost non-existent. The many large granite boulders that cover the path evidence the instability of the mountains to the north and south. The merchants who travel this road have erected a series of shoddy road signs to direct travelers safely around the boulders. Several of these signs point away from a shadowy area just off the side of the road. The rocks of the area seem to hang over the road slightly, blocking out the light. Light colored stringy material is barely visible along the side of the path.  A flimsy wooden sign, a flimsy wooden sign, and a craggy overhang are here.

A large number of horses, carts, and merchants are congregated off the side of the road. They are either preparing for the journey down the cliff to the southwest, or are resting from the trip in the opposite direction. A dangerously high cliff is visible to the south, while to the east a flat plateau leads the roadway between two large mountains. The green hue of a forest is just visible between them.

Small low-lying bushes with bright red berries dominate this stretch of the road. Many birds of various sizes and colors hop from bush to bush, chirping pleasantly as they feast upon the berries. Just to the northeast, the road ascends over the top of the cliff and out of sight. To the west, most of the merchant road is discernible following along the precarious cliff face.

The cliff face to the north is wet, but there is no apparent source of the moisture. A slight overhang also creates a near permanent shadow in the area, providing a perfect atmosphere for the dense lichen that covers the rocks. Sporadic tufts of grass futilely attempt to assert themselves against the multi-colored lichen, but the spongy fungus prevails. Strange looking spiders scurry about amongst the lichen-covered rocks, before disappearing over the top of the cliff.

There is an extremely large crevasse in the roadway that would normally prevent any further travel along this road. Astoundingly, someone has constructed a very sturdy looking bridge using two perfectly chiseled granite blocks. The blocks make up the support for the bridge structure, which is also constructed of chiseled granite slabs. There is seemingly no explanation for the excellent condition of this stretch of the road.  A sturdy granite bridge is here.

A large pile of animal carcasses in various stages of decay is situated on a precarious ledge halfway up the cliff face. Bloody footprints from some sort of predatory animal are plainly visible along the edge of the path, providing a bit of insight into the decaying animal remains. The road reaches the top of the cliff up the gentle slope to the east.  Some greying oak planks are here.

Several large cracks split the roads surface at odd angles, threatening to swallow unwary travelers. Large and very unsteady wooden boards have been placed across the gaps, creating makeshift bridges. Many of the boards have a significant curve to them, suggesting that they may have been the victim of a rather large traveler.

A large gap in the roadway is now spanned by a rickety looking wood and rope bridge. The slats seem to be spaced just close enough so that a wagon wheel does not get lodged between them. The remnants of the foundations of an old stone bridge are evident on both sides of this gap. A few hundred feet below the present bridge, the former one is visible in several pieces. Considering the state of the old bridge, this unstable replacement does not exactly inspire feelings of safety.  A decrepit looking wood and rope bridge is here.

A large pile of unexplained wooden crates and barrels have been tossed unceremoniously in an alcove off the side of the main road. They have all been scavenged long ago and simply lie abandoned by their owners. For hundreds of feet in either direction, the road surface is covered in deep grooves, making wagon travel quite hazardous. Even at a slow pace the vibrations are intense enough to damage cargo. This is made evident as a heavily laden wagon shudders down the slope. Swearing loudly, the merchant tosses what sounds like a crate full of broken glass into the alcove before continuing onward.  A pile of wooden crates and barrels is here.

The poor construction of this road becomes quickly evident. Water is flowing down over the sides of the cliff above and across the road surface. Due to the slight slope of the road toward the deep chasm to the south, this section of road is quite hazardous. Many broken pieces of rope and metal spikes are strewn all over the pathway; evidently failed attempts to keep wagons from sliding over the side. Large piles of heavy looking stones have now been stacked along the edge of the gorge in hopes it will prevent trade carts from careening off the edge. Several of these stones seem to be missing. Evidently the idea is not working as well as was hoped.  A large pile of stones and a large pile of stones are here.

The cliff face to the north is slightly more sloped than others, allowing far more vegetation to grow on it. Small shapes are visible scurrying about among the grasses and shrubs, most of them reacting to any movement on the road. A few are visible up the road ahead, but quickly vanish at the distant screech of a raptor. It is a few moments before they curiously return.  Some small cute striped chipmunks are here.

Despite the fact the cliffs to the north are nearly vertical, various plants still cling to life against them. Many are common weeds or merely grasses, but some are delicate wildflowers, leaving little or no explanation as to their presence on the cliff. One small tree is also attempting to take root along the cliffside, its branches jutting out at odd angles.  An oddly shaped rosewood tree is here.

The cliffs to the south fall away just for a brief instant at this point on the trail. Two picturesque snow-capped mountain peaks come together in the distance for a lower pass through their forested bases. The white glint of a distant waterfall glistens amongst the green backdrop.

Just to the south is the juncture where old merchant road connected to this new road. Just beyond that is the deep gorge that has swallowed up the old road. The road surface is a stable solid rock, but is barely large enough for a single wagon to pass through. Unlike the new merchant road to the southwest, this road follows a more natural flow up the eastern cliffside carefully traversing the steep mountain. A single yellow wildflower grows defiantly out of the rocky cliff, giving a stark contrast to the solid grey that surrounds it.  A small yellow wildflower is here.

A lone carrion bird seems to stare from the branches of a gnarled old tree. The road surface alternates between the usual hard-packed dirt covered in gravel, and solid rock. The terrain creates even more difficult travel for those heading north or south. A large pile of broken wagons, barrels, and boxes lie quite some distance below. Many skeletons of pack animals, picked clean by carrion birds, are also discernible. It is highly likely some of the bones are Humanoid as well.

A swiftly flowing river is visible several hundred feet below, and it can only be assumed that it was the cause of the collapse of old merchant road. The audible roar of the river is evident, even this far above.

The old merchant road lies in pieces at the bottom of a deep gorge far below. An artificial pathway has been constructed in the wake of the recent collapse, allowing continued passage through the mountains. This new merchant road has been constructed in great haste and is still quite unstable. Gravel that has been spread on the road to make it safer, is actually making it far more precarious. Pebbles roll continuously off of the roads surface and down into the chasm below.

A treacherous dusty trail leads west along the shaky fault line from a fork in the main road. The original roadbed has fallen into the chasm years ago, leaving the merchants to their own wiles to ply the slippery slopes past the fault zone. Many attempts have failed at conquering the shifting dirt and rocks. Currently a bumpy trail skirts the bigger rocks and loose gravel.

As the merchant road approaches the western end of the valley, the valley wall abruptly falls away to a sheer drop. Crumbling rock and dirt spill constantly into the deep abyss. Sections of the mountain have slid away into the valley and the merchant road has been rebuilt higher along the steeper sides of the mountain. The fault line of broken rocks continues its path of destruction to the west, skirted by the land-slide prone softer dirt.   A freshly uncovered crevice is here.

The trembling fault line reveals the cataclysmic trauma of the solid bedrock beneath the mountains. Striations of tortured, twisted rock bent almost in half under the strain stand out dramatically against darker, older layers of bedrock.

A short tremor suddenly rocks the cracked merchant road! A dusty pall sifts into the air from cracks in the ground and the shifting of gravel around the valley.  The tremor rolls through the canyon walls like a ripple, as if it were a linen sheet that was lifted and settled again. Pack animals and travelers alike stop momentarily and then hasten their pace as if to leave the quake behind them.

As the merchant road approaches the western end of the valley, the valley wall abruptly falls away to a sheer drop. Crumbling rock and dirt spill constantly into the deep abyss. Sections of the mountain have slid away into the valley and the merchant road has been rebuilt higher along the steeper sides of the mountain. The fault line of broken rocks continues its path of destruction to the west, skirted by the land-slide prone softer dirt.   A freshly uncovered crevice is here.

A treacherous dusty trail leads west along the shaky fault line from a fork in the main road. The original roadbed has fallen into the chasm years ago, leaving the merchants to their own wiles to ply the slippery slopes past the fault zone. Many attempts have failed at conquering the shifting dirt and rocks. Currently a bumpy trail skirts the bigger rocks and loose gravel.

You stand before a gate about 3 feet high, yellowing and rusty from years of use. It doesn't look like anyone takes care of it regularly. A sign is sticking out of the ground off the side of the path, slightly crooked. The writing on the board is crudely scrawled into the wood, reading "Wolf Trap". You can only assume that is the name given to the quiet town seen past the gate.  An open rusting gate is here.

The area around you seems lifeless and empty. Dominating the otherwise bare Town Square is a large fountain. The fountain's base is circular, with the statue of a wolf howling at the moon in the middle. The structure is devoid of water, and the stone has grown faded and bleached from the sun. Faded marks, where the fountain water used to flow, run down the wolf's chin.  A faded dry stone fountain is here.

The desolation of the house grows more oppressive as you trudge across its creaky floorboards. This must have been a small parlor, with a small settee lying in splinters on the floor. Immovable golden portrait frames are bolted to the walls, though their pictures have been ripped out by vandals.  An open door and a torn portrait are here.

[Residence, Kitchen]

You are standing in a room that was once the kitchen.  A small hearth, long cold, sits in one corner.  The woodbox is empty.  Scattered pots and a teakettle squashed nearly flat lie on the filthy floor.  Someone has had a fine time making the place uninhabitable.

Obviously there used to be a door to the east, but the hinges that used to hold it are rusty and practically pulled off. Tiny shapes skitter away from you as you enter. It doesn't appear there have been any other visitors in quite some time.  The room beyond is equally dark and dusty.

The air here is thick with dust and darkness. The ruins of a large bed are scattered throughout the room, and a hole is in the floorboards where it used to reside.  An open trapdoor is here.

[Secret Tunnel]

The ever-narrowing tunnel seems to hit a dead end here, you are practically lying flat to fit in it. Dust sifts down from above, filling your eyes with grit.  An open trapdoor and an old wooden rickety shack are here.

[Cavern]

An underground cavern has been concealed from the town above, and seems to be much more lively than any other place you've encountered. Some townsfolk are sleeping in shabby tents, while others sit in small groups and eye you warily, growing silent as you draw near.  An open trapdoor is here.

[Wolf Trap-Town Square.]

The area around you seems lifeless and empty. Dominating the otherwise bare Town Square is a large fountain. The fountain's base is circular, with the statue of a wolf howling at the moon in the middle. The structure is devoid of water, and the stone has grown faded and bleached from the sun. Faded marks, where the fountain water used to flow, run down the wolf's chin.  A faded dry stone fountain is here.

[Dusty Road.]

You stand before a gate about 3 feet high, yellowing and rusty from years of use. It doesn't look like anyone takes care of it regularly. A sign is sticking out of the ground off the side of the path, slightly crooked. The writing on the board is crudely scrawled into the wood, reading "Wolf Trap". You can only assume that is the name given to the quiet town seen past the gate.  An open rusting gate is here.

Many attempts have failed at conquering the shifting dirt and rocks. Currently a bumpy trail skirts the bigger rocks and loose gravel.

The old merchant road lies in pieces at the bottom of a deep gorge far below. An artificial pathway has been constructed in the wake of the recent collapse, allowing continued passage through the mountains. This new merchant road has been constructed in great haste and is still quite unstable. Gravel that has been spread on the road to make it safer, is actually making it far more precarious. Pebbles roll continuously off of the roads surface and down into the chasm below.

The road ascends upward at a rather severe angle towards the northwest combined with the shifting road surface, it makes this particular passage very difficult for any merchants traveling with a large quantity of goods. A swiftly flowing river is visible several hundred feet below, and it can only be assumed that it was the cause of the collapse of old merchant road. The audible roar of the river is evident, even this far above.

A lone carrion bird seems to stare from the branches of a gnarled old tree. The road surface alternates between the usual hard-packed dirt covered in gravel, and solid rock. The terrain creates even more difficult travel for those heading north or south. A large pile of broken wagons, barrels, and boxes lie quite some distance below. Many skeletons of pack animals, picked clean by carrion birds, are also discernible. It is highly likely some of the bones are Humanoid as well.

Just to the south is the juncture where old merchant road connected to this new road. Just beyond that is the deep gorge that has swallowed up the old road. The road surface is a stable solid rock, but is barely large enough for a single wagon to pass through. Unlike the new merchant road to the southwest, this road follows a more natural flow up the eastern cliffside carefully traversing the steep mountain. A single yellow wildflower grows defiantly out of the rocky cliff, giving a stark contrast to the solid grey that surrounds it.  A small yellow wildflower is here.

The cliffs to the south fall away just for a brief instant at this point on the trail. Two picturesque snow-capped mountain peaks come together in the distance for a lower pass through their forested bases. The white glint of a distant waterfall glistens amongst the green backdrop. The granite road below you continues its precarious trek eastward up the cliffside.

Despite the fact the cliffs to the north are nearly vertical, various plants still cling to life against them. Many are common weeds or merely grasses, but some are delicate wildflowers, leaving little or no explanation as to their presence on the cliff. One small tree is also attempting to take root along the cliffside, its branches jutting out at odd angles.  An oddly shaped rosewood tree is here.

The cliff face to the north is slightly more sloped than others, allowing far more vegetation to grow on it. Small shapes are visible scurrying about among the grasses and shrubs, most of them reacting to any movement on the road. A few are visible up the road ahead, but quickly vanish at the distant screech of a raptor. It is a few moments before they curiously return.  Some small cute striped chipmunks are here.

The poor construction of this road becomes quickly evident. Water is flowing down over the sides of the cliff above and across the road surface. Due to the slight slope of the road toward the deep chasm to the south, this section of road is quite hazardous. Many broken pieces of rope and metal spikes are strewn all over the pathway; evidently failed attempts to keep wagons from sliding over the side. Large piles of heavy looking stones have now been stacked along the edge of the gorge in hopes it will prevent trade carts from careening off the edge. Several of these stones seem to be missing. Evidently the idea is not working as well as was hoped.  A large pile of stones and a large pile of stones are here.

A large pile of unexplained wooden crates and barrels have been tossed unceremoniously in an alcove off the side of the main road. They have all been scavenged long ago and simply lie abandoned by their owners. For hundreds of feet in either direction, the road surface is covered in deep grooves, making wagon travel quite hazardous. Even at a slow pace the vibrations are intense enough to damage cargo. This is made evident as a heavily laden wagon shudders down the slope. Swearing loudly, the merchant tosses what sounds like a crate full of broken glass into the alcove before continuing onward.  A pile of wooden crates and barrels is here.

A large pile of unexplained wooden crates and barrels have been tossed unceremoniously in an alcove off the side of the main road. They have all been scavenged long ago and simply lie abandoned by their owners. For hundreds of feet in either direction, the road surface is covered in deep grooves, making wagon travel quite hazardous. Even at a slow pace the vibrations are intense enough to damage cargo. This is made evident as a heavily laden wagon shudders down the slope. Swearing loudly, the merchant tosses what sounds like a crate full of broken glass into the alcove before continuing onward.  A pile of wooden crates and barrels and a closed corroded platinum chest are here.

The poor construction of this road becomes quickly evident. Water is flowing down over the sides of the cliff above and across the road surface. Due to the slight slope of the road toward the deep chasm to the south, this section of road is quite hazardous. Many broken pieces of rope and metal spikes are strewn all over the pathway; evidently failed attempts to keep wagons from sliding over the side. Large piles of heavy looking stones have now been stacked along the edge of the gorge in hopes it will prevent trade carts from careening off the edge. Several of these stones seem to be missing. Evidently the idea is not working as well as was hoped.  A large pile of stones and a large pile of stones are here.

A large gap in the roadway is now spanned by a rickety looking wood and rope bridge. The slats seem to be spaced just close enough so that a wagon wheel does not get lodged between them. The remnants of the foundations of an old stone bridge are evident on both sides of this gap. A few hundred feet below the present bridge, the former one is visible in several pieces. Considering the state of the old bridge, this unstable replacement does not exactly inspire feelings of safety.  A decrepit looking wood and rope bridge is here.

The poor construction of this road becomes quickly evident. Water is flowing down over the sides of the cliff above and across the road surface. Due to the slight slope of the road toward the deep chasm to the south, this section of road is quite hazardous. Many broken pieces of rope and metal spikes are strewn all over the pathway; evidently failed attempts to keep wagons from sliding over the side. Large piles of heavy looking stones have now been stacked along the edge of the gorge in hopes it will prevent trade carts from careening off the edge. Several of these stones seem to be missing. Evidently the idea is not working as well as was hoped.  A large pile of stones and a large pile of stones are here.

A large pile of unexplained wooden crates and barrels have been tossed unceremoniously in an alcove off the side of the main road. They have all been scavenged long ago and simply lie abandoned by their owners. For hundreds of feet in either direction, the road surface is covered in deep grooves, making wagon travel quite hazardous. Even at a slow pace the vibrations are intense enough to damage cargo. This is made evident as a heavily laden wagon shudders down the slope. Swearing loudly, the merchant tosses what sounds like a crate full of broken glass into the alcove before continuing onward.  A pile of wooden crates and barrels and an open corroded platinum chest are here.

A large gap in the roadway is now spanned by a rickety looking wood and rope bridge. The slats seem to be spaced just close enough so that a wagon wheel does not get lodged between them. The remnants of the foundations of an old stone bridge are evident on both sides of this gap. A few hundred feet below the present bridge, the former one is visible in several pieces. Considering the state of the old bridge, this unstable replacement does not exactly inspire feelings of safety.  A decrepit looking wood and rope bridge is here.

Several large cracks split the roads surface at odd angles, threatening to swallow unwary travelers. Large and very unsteady wooden boards have been placed across the gaps, creating makeshift bridges. Many of the boards have a significant curve to them, suggesting that they may have been the victim of a rather large traveler.

A large pile of animal carcasses in various stages of decay is situated on a precarious ledge halfway up the cliff face. Bloody footprints from some sort of predatory animal are plainly visible along the edge of the path, providing a bit of insight into the decaying animal remains. The road reaches the top of the cliff up the gentle slope to the east.  Some greying oak planks are here.

There is an extremely large crevasse in the roadway that would normally prevent any further travel along this road. Astoundingly, someone has constructed a very sturdy looking bridge using two perfectly chiseled granite blocks. The blocks make up the support for the bridge structure, which is also constructed of chiseled granite slabs. There is seemingly no explanation for the excellent condition of this stretch of the road.  A sturdy granite bridge is here.

The cliff face to the north is wet, but there is no apparent source of the moisture. A slight overhang also creates a near permanent shadow in the area, providing a perfect atmosphere for the dense lichen that covers the rocks. Sporadic tufts of grass futilely attempt to assert themselves against the multi-colored lichen, but the spongy fungus prevails. Strange looking spiders scurry about amongst the lichen-covered rocks, before disappearing over the top of the cliff.

Small low-lying bushes with bright red berries dominate this stretch of the road. Many birds of various sizes and colors hop from bush to bush, chirping pleasantly as they feast upon the berries. Just to the northeast, the road ascends over the top of the cliff and out of sight. To the west, most of the merchant road is discernible following along the precarious cliff face.

A large number of horses, carts, and merchants are congregated off the side of the road. They are either preparing for the journey down the cliff to the southwest, or are resting from the trip in the opposite direction. A dangerously high cliff is visible to the south, while to the east a flat plateau leads the roadway between two large mountains. The green hue of a forest is just visible between them.

A large number of horses, carts, and merchants are congregated off the side of the road. They are either preparing for the journey down the cliff to the southwest, or are resting from the trip in the opposite direction. A dangerously high cliff is visible to the south, while to the east a flat plateau leads the roadway between two large mountains. The green hue of a forest is just visible between them.  A closed crude bag, some gold coins, some silver coins, a floppy canvas hat, some silver coins, and a pair of warm fuzzy mittens are here.

The road is almost non-existent. The many large granite boulders that cover the path evidence the instability of the mountains to the north and south. The merchants who travel this road have erected a series of shoddy road signs to direct travelers safely around the boulders. Several of these signs point away from a shadowy area just off the side of the road. The rocks of the area seem to hang over the road slightly, blocking out the light. Light colored stringy material is barely visible along the side of the path.  A flimsy wooden sign, a flimsy wooden sign, and a craggy overhang are here.

The merchant road ascends slightly to the east as it travels between two mountain peaks. Up the slopes to the north and south is a dense forest with massive red barked trees. Closer to the path, the forest begins to thin out and only a few trees have established themselves close to the road. The merchants who made this road did not bother to go around one of the largest, which is situated directly in the middle of the path.  An ancient towering rosewood tree is here.

The area around the road is lush and green, and many rare plants are visible among the rocks. A lone tree stump is situated along the side of the path, providing a good rest stop for the weary traveler.  A rare red dragon-lily is here.

The tranquil terrain has been torn asunder to the northwest. One of the forces of nature has caused a great fissure to open in the earth. Although the fissure slopes downward at a severe angle, the terrain is surprisingly smooth and could be navigated even by a goods-loaded wagon. To the east a great deal of grass is growing on the road itself. It almost seems as if no one has used that road in a while.

Small low-lying bushes with bright red berries dominate this stretch of the road. Many birds of various sizes and colors hop from bush to bush, chirping pleasantly as they feast upon the berries. Just to the northeast, the road ascends over the top of the cliff and out of sight. To the west, most of the merchant road is discernible following along the precarious cliff face.

The cliff face to the north is wet, but there is no apparent source of the moisture. A slight overhang also creates a near permanent shadow in the area, providing a perfect atmosphere for the dense lichen that covers the rocks. Sporadic tufts of grass futilely attempt to assert themselves against the multi-colored lichen, but the spongy fungus prevails. Strange looking spiders scurry about amongst the lichen-covered rocks, before disappearing over the top of the cliff.

There is an extremely large crevasse in the roadway that would normally prevent any further travel along this road. Astoundingly, someone has constructed a very sturdy looking bridge using two perfectly chiseled granite blocks. The blocks make up the support for the bridge structure, which is also constructed of chiseled granite slabs. There is seemingly no explanation for the excellent condition of this stretch of the road.  A sturdy granite bridge is here.

Bloody footprints from some sort of predatory animal are plainly visible along the edge of the path, providing a bit of insight into the decaying animal remains. The road reaches the top of the cliff up the gentle slope to the east.  Some greying oak planks are here.

Several large cracks split the roads surface at odd angles, threatening to swallow unwary travelers. Large and very unsteady wooden boards have been placed across the gaps, creating makeshift bridges. Many of the boards have a significant curve to them, suggesting that they may have been the victim of a rather large traveler.

A large gap in the roadway is now spanned by a rickety looking wood and rope bridge. The slats seem to be spaced just close enough so that a wagon wheel does not get lodged between them. The remnants of the foundations of an old stone bridge are evident on both sides of this gap. A few hundred feet below the present bridge, the former one is visible in several pieces. Considering the state of the old bridge, this unstable replacement does not exactly inspire feelings of safety.  A decrepit looking wood and rope bridge is here.

A large pile of unexplained wooden crates and barrels have been tossed unceremoniously in an alcove off the side of the main road. They have all been scavenged long ago and simply lie abandoned by their owners. For hundreds of feet in either direction, the road surface is covered in deep grooves, making wagon travel quite hazardous. Even at a slow pace the vibrations are intense enough to damage cargo. This is made evident as a heavily laden wagon shudders down the slope. Swearing loudly, the merchant tosses what sounds like a crate full of broken glass into the alcove before continuing onward.  A pile of wooden crates and barrels and an open corroded platinum chest are here.

The poor construction of this road becomes quickly evident. Water is flowing down over the sides of the cliff above and across the road surface. Due to the slight slope of the road toward the deep chasm to the south, this section of road is quite hazardous. Many broken pieces of rope and metal spikes are strewn all over the pathway; evidently failed attempts to keep wagons from sliding over the side. Large piles of heavy looking stones have now been stacked along the edge of the gorge in hopes it will prevent trade carts from careening off the edge. Several of these stones seem to be missing. Evidently the idea is not working as well as was hoped.  A large pile of stones and a large pile of stones are here.

The cliff face to the north is slightly more sloped than others, allowing far more vegetation to grow on it. Small shapes are visible scurrying about among the grasses and shrubs, most of them reacting to any movement on the road. A few are visible up the road ahead, but quickly vanish at the distant screech of a raptor. It is a few moments before they curiously return.  Some small cute striped chipmunks are here.

Despite the fact the cliffs to the north are nearly vertical, various plants still cling to life against them. Many are common weeds or merely grasses, but some are delicate wildflowers, leaving little or no explanation as to their presence on the cliff. One small tree is also attempting to take root along the cliffside, its branches jutting out at odd angles.  An oddly shaped rosewood tree is here.

The cliffs to the south fall away just for a brief instant at this point on the trail. Two picturesque snow-capped mountain peaks come together in the distance for a lower pass through their forested bases. The white glint of a distant waterfall glistens amongst the green backdrop. The granite road below you continues its precarious trek eastward up the cliffside.

Just to the south is the juncture where old merchant road connected to this new road. Just beyond that is the deep gorge that has swallowed up the old road. The road surface is a stable solid rock, but is barely large enough for a single wagon to pass through. Unlike the new merchant road to the southwest, this road follows a more natural flow up the eastern cliffside carefully traversing the steep mountain. A single yellow wildflower grows defiantly out of the rocky cliff, giving a stark contrast to the solid grey that surrounds it.  A small yellow wildflower is here.

A lone carrion bird seems to stare from the branches of a gnarled old tree. The road surface alternates between the usual hard-packed dirt covered in gravel, and solid rock. The terrain creates even more difficult travel for those heading north or south. A large pile of broken wagons, barrels, and boxes lie quite some distance below. Many skeletons of pack animals, picked clean by carrion birds, are also discernible. It is highly likely some of the bones are Humanoid as well.

The road ascends upward at a rather severe angle towards the northwest combined with the shifting road surface, it makes this particular passage very difficult for any merchants traveling with a large quantity of goods. A swiftly flowing river is visible several hundred feet below, and it can only be assumed that it was the cause of the collapse of old merchant road. The audible roar of the river is evident, even this far above.

The old merchant road lies in pieces at the bottom of a deep gorge far below. An artificial pathway has been constructed in the wake of the recent collapse, allowing continued passage through the mountains. This new merchant road has been constructed in great haste and is still quite unstable. Gravel that has been spread on the road to make it safer, is actually making it far more precarious. Pebbles roll continuously off of the roads surface and down into the chasm below.

A treacherous dusty trail leads west along the shaky fault line from a fork in the main road. The original roadbed has fallen into the chasm years ago, leaving the merchants to their own wiles to ply the slippery slopes past the fault zone. Many attempts have failed at conquering the shifting dirt and rocks. Currently a bumpy trail skirts the bigger rocks and loose gravel.

A treacherous dusty trail leads west along the shaky fault line from a fork in the main road. The original roadbed has fallen into the chasm years ago, leaving the merchants to their own wiles to ply the slippery slopes past the fault zone. Many attempts have failed at conquering the shifting dirt and rocks. Currently a bumpy trail skirts the bigger rocks and loose gravel.   An open simple bearskin bag, a short leaf bladed bronze cuchillo, and a two-handed bronze pike are here.

As the merchant road approaches the western end of the valley, the valley wall abruptly falls away to a sheer drop. Crumbling rock and dirt spill constantly into the deep abyss. Sections of the mountain have slid away into the valley and the merchant road has been rebuilt higher along the steeper sides of the mountain. The fault line of broken rocks continues its path of destruction to the west, skirted by the land-slide prone softer dirt.   A freshly uncovered crevice is here.

A short tremor suddenly rocks the cracked merchant road! A dusty pall sifts into the air from cracks in the ground and the shifting of gravel around the valley.  The tremor rolls through the canyon walls like a ripple, as if it were a linen sheet that was lifted and settled again. Pack animals and travelers alike stop momentarily and then hasten their pace as if to leave the quake behind them.

The rocky valley walls widen to the accommodate the splitting of the Tarath fault line. The Great Divide towers to the north beyond the fractured, broken badlands. Sheer, monolithic cliffs dropping for thousands of feet front the western edge of the mountains; their sharp, snow-capped peaks vaulting nearly vertically from the floor of the fault line valley. The merchant road bed is cracked and broken as it negotiates the larger twists and turns.

The rocky valley walls widen to the accommodate the splitting of the Tarath fault line. The Great Divide towers to the north beyond the fractured, broken badlands. Sheer, monolithic cliffs dropping for thousands of feet front the western edge of the mountains; their sharp, snow-capped peaks vaulting nearly vertically from the floor of the fault line valley. The merchant road bed is cracked and broken as it negotiates the larger twists and turns.

Pack animals and travelers alike stop momentarily and then hasten their pace as if to leave the quake behind them.

As the merchant road approaches the western end of the valley, the valley wall abruptly falls away to a sheer drop. Crumbling rock and dirt spill constantly into the deep abyss. Sections of the mountain have slid away into the valley and the merchant road has been rebuilt higher along the steeper sides of the mountain. The fault line of broken rocks continues its path of destruction to the west, skirted by the land-slide prone softer dirt.   A freshly uncovered crevice is here.

As the merchant road approaches the western end of the valley, the valley wall abruptly falls away to a sheer drop. Crumbling rock and dirt spill constantly into the deep abyss. Sections of the mountain have slid away into the valley and the merchant road has been rebuilt higher along the steeper sides of the mountain. The fault line of broken rocks continues its path of destruction to the west, skirted by the land-slide prone softer dirt.   A freshly uncovered crevice, a closed handmade brass chest, and a closed muddy tigerskin pouch are here.

You see the 1st lizardman corpse and the 1st ogre.

As the merchant road approaches the western end of the valley, the valley wall abruptly falls away to a sheer drop. Crumbling rock and dirt spill constantly into the deep abyss. Sections of the mountain have slid away into the valley and the merchant road has been rebuilt higher along the steeper sides of the mountain. The fault line of broken rocks continues its path of destruction to the west, skirted by the land-slide prone softer dirt.   A freshly uncovered crevice is here.

A treacherous dusty trail leads west along the shaky fault line from a fork in the main road. The original roadbed has fallen into the chasm years ago, leaving the merchants to their own wiles to ply the slippery slopes past the fault zone. Many attempts have failed at conquering the shifting dirt and rocks. Currently a bumpy trail skirts the bigger rocks and loose gravel.

A sign is sticking out of the ground off the side of the path, slightly crooked. The writing on the board is crudely scrawled into the wood, reading "Wolf Trap". You can only assume that is the name given to the quiet town seen past the gate.  An open rusting gate is here.

The area around you seems lifeless and empty. Dominating the otherwise bare Town Square is a large fountain. The fountain's base is circular, with the statue of a wolf howling at the moon in the middle. The structure is devoid of water, and the stone has grown faded and bleached from the sun. Faded marks, where the fountain water used to flow, run down the wolf's chin.  A faded dry stone fountain is here.

Faded marks, where the fountain water used to flow, run down the wolf's chin.  A faded dry stone fountain is here.

The area around you seems lifeless and empty. Dominating the otherwise bare Town Square is a large fountain. The fountain's base is circular, with the statue of a wolf howling at the moon in the middle. The structure is devoid of water, and the stone has grown faded and bleached from the sun. Faded marks, where the fountain water used to flow, run down the wolf's chin.  A faded dry stone fountain is here.

[Wolf Trap-Town Square.]

The area around you seems lifeless and empty. Dominating the otherwise bare Town Square is a large fountain. The fountain's base is circular, with the statue of a wolf howling at the moon in the middle. The structure is devoid of water, and the stone has grown faded and bleached from the sun. Faded marks, where the fountain water used to flow, run down the wolf's chin.  A faded dry stone fountain is here.

The area around you seems lifeless and empty. Dominating the otherwise bare Town Square is a large fountain. The fountain's base is circular, with the statue of a wolf howling at the moon in the middle. The structure is devoid of water, and the stone has grown faded and bleached from the sun. Faded marks, where the fountain water used to flow, run down the wolf's chin.  A faded dry stone fountain is here.

The fountain perched in the center of the lawn dominates the landscape. Standing much taller than a Human, it is adorned with an elegant statue of a mature Dragon. Its finely carved wings are grandly unfurled, as if ready to take flight. Although water no longer fills the fountain, it is still impressive in this forlorn spot.  A crested Dragon fountain is here.

[Front Lawn]

The front lawn is designed to circle a fountain in the middle of the lot, the shape of which is hard to make out from here. It sits to the east, silent and dried up, as if waiting to be revived.  Some silver coins, a short rusting bronze gutting knife, and a closed scuffed buckskin case are here.

The fountain perched in the center of the lawn dominates the landscape. Standing much taller than a Human, it is adorned with an elegant statue of a mature Dragon. Its finely carved wings are grandly unfurled, as if ready to take flight. Although water no longer fills the fountain, it is still impressive in this forlorn spot.  A crested Dragon fountain is here.

The desolation of the house grows more oppressive as you trudge across its creaky floorboards. This must have been a small parlor, with a small settee lying in splinters on the floor. Immovable golden portrait frames are bolted to the walls, though their pictures have been ripped out by vandals.  An open door and a torn portrait are here.

The area around you seems lifeless and empty. Dominating the otherwise bare Town Square is a large fountain. The fountain's base is circular, with the statue of a wolf howling at the moon in the middle. The structure is devoid of water, and the stone has grown faded and bleached from the sun. Faded marks, where the fountain water used to flow, run down the wolf's chin.  A faded dry stone fountain is here.

The fountain's base is circular, with the statue of a wolf howling at the moon in the middle. The structure is devoid of water, and the stone has grown faded and bleached from the sun. Faded marks, where the fountain water used to flow, run down the wolf's chin.  A faded dry stone fountain is here.

The area around you seems lifeless and empty. Dominating the otherwise bare Town Square is a large fountain. The fountain's base is circular, with the statue of a wolf howling at the moon in the middle. The structure is devoid of water, and the stone has grown faded and bleached from the sun. Faded marks, where the fountain water used to flow, run down the wolf's chin.  A faded dry stone fountain is here.

As the merchant road approaches the western end of the valley, the valley wall abruptly falls away to a sheer drop. Crumbling rock and dirt spill constantly into the deep abyss.

The fault line of broken rocks continues its path of destruction to the west, skirted by the land-slide prone softer dirt.   A freshly uncovered crevice is here.

A short tremor suddenly rocks the cracked merchant road! A dusty pall sifts into the air from cracks in the ground and the shifting of gravel around the valley.  The tremor rolls through the canyon walls like a ripple, as if it were a linen sheet that was lifted and settled again. Pack animals and travelers alike stop momentarily and then hasten their pace as if to leave the quake behind them.

The rocky valley walls widen to the accommodate the splitting of the Tarath fault line. The Great Divide towers to the north beyond the fractured, broken badlands. Sheer, monolithic cliffs dropping for thousands of feet front the western edge of the mountains; their sharp, snow-capped peaks vaulting nearly vertically from the floor of the fault line valley. The merchant road bed is cracked and broken as it negotiates the larger twists and turns.

A short vibration shudders the roadbed, causing dust and gravel to shimmy down the canyon walls. A few larger rocks ping and ricochet off boulders, until all is deadly silent.  The merchant road is dusted with bits of broken rock, covering any recent tracks.

A short tremor suddenly rocks the cracked merchant road! A dusty pall sifts into the air from cracks in the ground and the shifting of gravel around the valley.  The tremor rolls through the canyon walls like a ripple, as if it were a linen sheet that was lifted and settled again. Pack animals and travelers alike stop momentarily and then hasten their pace as if to leave the quake behind them.

As the merchant road approaches the western end of the valley, the valley wall abruptly falls away to a sheer drop. Crumbling rock and dirt spill constantly into the deep abyss. Sections of the mountain have slid away into the valley and the merchant road has been rebuilt higher along the steeper sides of the mountain. The fault line of broken rocks continues its path of destruction to the west, skirted by the land-slide prone softer dirt.   A freshly uncovered crevice, a cold cherry tart, a gleaming tiger's eye quartz marble, a frilly black lace barmaid's frock, and a small mottled marble mortar are here.

A treacherous dusty trail leads west along the shaky fault line from a fork in the main road. The original roadbed has fallen into the chasm years ago, leaving the merchants to their own wiles to ply the slippery slopes past the fault zone. Many attempts have failed at conquering the shifting dirt and rocks. Currently a bumpy trail skirts the bigger rocks and loose gravel.

The old merchant road lies in pieces at the bottom of a deep gorge far below. An artificial pathway has been constructed in the wake of the recent collapse, allowing continued passage through the mountains. This new merchant road has been constructed in great haste and is still quite unstable. Gravel that has been spread on the road to make it safer, is actually making it far more precarious. Pebbles roll continuously off of the roads surface and down into the chasm below.

The road ascends upward at a rather severe angle towards the northwest combined with the shifting road surface, it makes this particular passage very difficult for any merchants traveling with a large quantity of goods. A swiftly flowing river is visible several hundred feet below, and it can only be assumed that it was the cause of the collapse of old merchant road. The audible roar of the river is evident, even this far above.

A lone carrion bird seems to stare from the branches of a gnarled old tree. The road surface alternates between the usual hard-packed dirt covered in gravel, and solid rock. The terrain creates even more difficult travel for those heading north or south. A large pile of broken wagons, barrels, and boxes lie quite some distance below. Many skeletons of pack animals, picked clean by carrion birds, are also discernible. It is highly likely some of the bones are Humanoid as well.

Just to the south is the juncture where old merchant road connected to this new road. Just beyond that is the deep gorge that has swallowed up the old road. The road surface is a stable solid rock, but is barely large enough for a single wagon to pass through. Unlike the new merchant road to the southwest, this road follows a more natural flow up the eastern cliffside carefully traversing the steep mountain. A single yellow wildflower grows defiantly out of the rocky cliff, giving a stark contrast to the solid grey that surrounds it.  A small yellow wildflower is here.

The cliffs to the south fall away just for a brief instant at this point on the trail. Two picturesque snow-capped mountain peaks come together in the distance for a lower pass through their forested bases. The white glint of a distant waterfall glistens amongst the green backdrop. The granite road below you continues its precarious trek eastward up the cliffside.

Despite the fact the cliffs to the north are nearly vertical, various plants still cling to life against them. Many are common weeds or merely grasses, but some are delicate wildflowers, leaving little or no explanation as to their presence on the cliff. One small tree is also attempting to take root along the cliffside, its branches jutting out at odd angles.  An oddly shaped rosewood tree is here.

The cliff face to the north is slightly more sloped than others, allowing far more vegetation to grow on it. Small shapes are visible scurrying about among the grasses and shrubs, most of them reacting to any movement on the road. A few are visible up the road ahead, but quickly vanish at the distant screech of a raptor. It is a few moments before they curiously return.  Some small cute striped chipmunks are here.

The poor construction of this road becomes quickly evident. Water is flowing down over the sides of the cliff above and across the road surface. Due to the slight slope of the road toward the deep chasm to the south, this section of road is quite hazardous. Many broken pieces of rope and metal spikes are strewn all over the pathway; evidently failed attempts to keep wagons from sliding over the side. Large piles of heavy looking stones have now been stacked along the edge of the gorge in hopes it will prevent trade carts from careening off the edge. Several of these stones seem to be missing. Evidently the idea is not working as well as was hoped.  A large pile of stones and a large pile of stones are here.

A large pile of unexplained wooden crates and barrels have been tossed unceremoniously in an alcove off the side of the main road. They have all been scavenged long ago and simply lie abandoned by their owners. For hundreds of feet in either direction, the road surface is covered in deep grooves, making wagon travel quite hazardous. Even at a slow pace the vibrations are intense enough to damage cargo. This is made evident as a heavily laden wagon shudders down the slope. Swearing loudly, the merchant tosses what sounds like a crate full of broken glass into the alcove before continuing onward.  A pile of wooden crates and barrels is here.

A large gap in the roadway is now spanned by a rickety looking wood and rope bridge. The slats seem to be spaced just close enough so that a wagon wheel does not get lodged between them. The remnants of the foundations of an old stone bridge are evident on both sides of this gap. A few hundred feet below the present bridge, the former one is visible in several pieces. Considering the state of the old bridge, this unstable replacement does not exactly inspire feelings of safety.  A decrepit looking wood and rope bridge is here.

Several large cracks split the roads surface at odd angles, threatening to swallow unwary travelers. Large and very unsteady wooden boards have been placed across the gaps, creating makeshift bridges. Many of the boards have a significant curve to them, suggesting that they may have been the victim of a rather large traveler.

A large pile of animal carcasses in various stages of decay is situated on a precarious ledge halfway up the cliff face. Bloody footprints from some sort of predatory animal are plainly visible along the edge of the path, providing a bit of insight into the decaying animal remains. The road reaches the top of the cliff up the gentle slope to the east.  Some greying oak planks are here.

There is an extremely large crevasse in the roadway that would normally prevent any further travel along this road. Astoundingly, someone has constructed a very sturdy looking bridge using two perfectly chiseled granite blocks. The blocks make up the support for the bridge structure, which is also constructed of chiseled granite slabs. There is seemingly no explanation for the excellent condition of this stretch of the road.  A sturdy granite bridge is here.

The cliff face to the north is wet, but there is no apparent source of the moisture. A slight overhang also creates a near permanent shadow in the area, providing a perfect atmosphere for the dense lichen that covers the rocks. Sporadic tufts of grass futilely attempt to assert themselves against the multi-colored lichen, but the spongy fungus prevails. Strange looking spiders scurry about amongst the lichen-covered rocks, before disappearing over the top of the cliff.

Small low-lying bushes with bright red berries dominate this stretch of the road. Many birds of various sizes and colors hop from bush to bush, chirping pleasantly as they feast upon the berries.

A large number of horses, carts, and merchants are congregated off the side of the road. They are either preparing for the journey down the cliff to the southwest, or are resting from the trip in the opposite direction. A dangerously high cliff is visible to the south, while to the east a flat plateau leads the roadway between two large mountains. The green hue of a forest is just visible between them.

The road is almost non-existent. The many large granite boulders that cover the path evidence the instability of the mountains to the north and south. The merchants who travel this road have erected a series of shoddy road signs to direct travelers safely around the boulders. Several of these signs point away from a shadowy area just off the side of the road. The rocks of the area seem to hang over the road slightly, blocking out the light. Light colored stringy material is barely visible along the side of the path.  A flimsy wooden sign, a flimsy wooden sign, and a craggy overhang are here.

The merchant road ascends slightly to the east as it travels between two mountain peaks. Up the slopes to the north and south is a dense forest with massive red barked trees. Closer to the path, the forest begins to thin out and only a few trees have established themselves close to the road. The merchants who made this road did not bother to go around one of the largest, which is situated directly in the middle of the path.  An ancient towering rosewood tree is here.

The tranquil terrain has been torn asunder to the northwest. One of the forces of nature has caused a great fissure to open in the earth. Although the fissure slopes downward at a severe angle, the terrain is surprisingly smooth and could be navigated even by a goods-loaded wagon. To the east a great deal of grass is growing on the road itself. It almost seems as if no one has used that road in a while.

Large conifers, capable of withstanding the dry climate, sparsely populate the hill to the south. Visible among the tops of the trees are several majestic red-tailed Rathanian hawks. The screech of the hawks fills the air, as they hunt their small furry prey from above.

A large gap between two large hills to the north and west offers safe passage through this hilly terrain. A cold wind out of the northwest blows stiffly, whipping up the dust. The ground is so dry that most of the topsoil is easily pulled off by the strong winds. Large angry clouds of dust move back and forth throughout the area, wreaking havoc on the eyes and lungs of any that dare to pass through them.  A large thick cloud of dust is here.

A slight wind blows through the area, picking up speed as it continues southeast between two hills. The road drops down to the west through a deep gully before turning out of sight. There is quite a bit of debris on the road in that direction. A family of prairie dogs has dug a series of holes a few meters from the road. One is constantly on watch, attempting to keep the family safe from harm. At the slightest noise, it scurries back into its hole and out of sight.  An animal made hole is here.

One of the walls in this gully has collapsed inward, covering the road surface. The landslide is surely recent, as it is not yet packed down and is still rolling fresh dirt from above.

This narrow valley is enclosed on all sides by mountains. Just to the south of the path is a small lake full of what is surely ice cold water. Various small streamlets are visible running down a few of the surrounding snow-capped peaks, ensuring that the icy lake will remain filled.

Old trees lay side by side with the massive boulders of the mountain, intermingling in a terrible landslide. The mountain top has broken off and slid across the eastern road stopping all forms of transportation. It would take years for mortal hands to remove the tons of stone from the original roadway to make it passable once again. Thankfully, nature has changed the landscape for the better, and has opened a gap through the mountain to the north.

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.  A flowing white marble fountain, a marble statue of a Human, a shimmering marble statue of a Dragon, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a rosewood sign, and a crisp gold lettered vellum notice are here.

Piles of rubble flank the road on both sides. Some new and some old, this rubble is a mixture of two guard towers and this side of the mountain. High above, the jagged peak of the small mountain thrusts itself out over the road, ready to collapse under the right circumstances. A new rent has been cut into the southeastern side of the mountain, allowing passage to the southern road.

The air is filled with small flecks of falling snow, but none of it looks to be hitting the ground. Small leafless shrubs dominate the landscape, leaving no explanation as to why they all appear to be dead. The main road leads down the mountainside to the east, and up over a crest to the northwest. This spot is approximately halfway up the slope of this cold mountain peak. The merchant road is visible to the east, making its way slowly out of the Tarath Bends.

Small rocks and pebbles tumble over the edge of a sharp drop off to the south. In the distance over the edge of the cliff, through two rather large hills, a city with octagonal walls surrounding it is just visible.

The road bends to the southwest around a large boulder as it slopes up the side of this mountain. From this vantage point, large imposing jagged peaks of the mountains above Rathan are visible. Each peak is heavily laden with snow, with only small sections of rock visible. A trail, presumably this one, is also visible traveling northward toward the peaks in the distance.

The path rises steeply to both the northeast and the west, traveling up the base of two opposing mountain peaks. The smaller peak to the west is far less pronounced than the peak to the northeast. This narrow valley is enclosed on all sides by mountains. Just to the south of the path is a small lake full of what is surely ice cold water. Various small streamlets are visible running down a few of the surrounding snow-capped peaks, ensuring that the icy lake will remain filled.

This section of the road is all that remains of the former mountain trail. The old pathway is visible to the north, however a large pile of moist earth, dull grey rock, and broken tree trunks has buried it several feet high making further passage impossible. It would seem this area is prone to landslides. A new road has been cut into the terrain to the southwest, heading in the direction of a smaller mountain peak. The old mountain trail is visible as it climbs up the barren mountainside to the north.

Ascending gradually to the northwest, the path curves gently along the base of a very large mountain to the north. The terrain is rough, and mostly composed of rock. In fact this particular section of the path seems to be cut into the side of the mountain. Though a gentle breeze is blowing, this area is oddly silent.

The merchant road slopes upward gradually to the west. Rocks and shrubs cover much of the path in this area, making it difficult to follow the trail properly. Two parallel lines are cut deeply into the earth, suggesting that several wagons have passed through here when the ground was wet. A cool breeze blows down the mountain.

This area is surprisingly flat. Two mountains loom in the distance, the larger one to the northwest. A faint outline of a road is visible as it makes its way up the northwestern mountain. To the northeast, the road drops down into a deep gully and out of sight. The western path ascends gently at it moves toward the smaller mountain.

One of the walls in this gully has collapsed inward, covering the road surface. The landslide is surely recent, as it is not yet packed down and is still rolling fresh dirt from above. It should be fairly easy to bypass this section of the road by climbing over the shifting dirt. Although surely dangerous, it might be possible to climb up the slide itself.

A slight wind blows through the area, picking up speed as it continues southeast between two hills. The road drops down to the west through a deep gully before turning out of sight. There is quite a bit of debris on the road in that direction. A family of prairie dogs has dug a series of holes a few meters from the road. One is constantly on watch, attempting to keep the family safe from harm. At the slightest noise, it scurries back into its hole and out of sight.  An animal made hole is here.

A large gap between two large hills to the north and west offers safe passage through this hilly terrain. A cold wind out of the northwest blows stiffly, whipping up the dust. The ground is so dry that most of the topsoil is easily pulled off by the strong winds. Large angry clouds of dust move back and forth throughout the area, wreaking havoc on the eyes and lungs of any that dare to pass through them.  A large thick cloud of dust is here.

The road slopes down slightly to the east, gently following a valley between two large hills. Ground dwelling rodents move about on the arid hill to the north gathering food. Large conifers, capable of withstanding the dry climate, sparsely populate the hill to the south. Visible among the tops of the trees are several majestic red-tailed Rathanian hawks. The screech of the hawks fills the air, as they hunt their small furry prey from above.

This area of the path is fairly nondescript. A sparsely forested hill rises steeply to the south while a rocky grass covered hill rises to the north. Neither is particularly spectacular, save a lone male deer which grazes at a higher elevation on the southern hill. A few spare patches of grass grow alongside the path. The environment becomes more arid to the west.

Where there was once a craggy rock-studded earthen cliff, a massive rent has formed. Through the cleft to the southwest, travel seems possible. The main road continues west between two large rocky hills, and northeast over a field of green grasses and gently rolling foothills. The air feels cool, and dry.

Tufts of dried grass intermixed with broken rock cover the ground of this makeshift merchant road. The vicious rend that created this pathway reaches its lowest point here, drastically sloping upward in both directions. Massive walls of constantly shifting rock and earth stand a few hundred feet in the air to the southwest and the northeast. Every now and then a few rocks tumble down the sides on top the heads of unwary travelers.

The tranquil terrain has been torn asunder to the northwest. One of the forces of nature has caused a great fissure to open in the earth. Although the fissure slopes downward at a severe angle, the terrain is surprisingly smooth and could be navigated even by a goods-loaded wagon. To the east a great deal of grass is growing on the road itself. It almost seems as if no one has used that road in a while.

The merchant road ascends slightly to the east as it travels between two mountain peaks. Up the slopes to the north and south is a dense forest with massive red barked trees. Closer to the path, the forest begins to thin out and only a few trees have established themselves close to the road. The merchants who made this road did not bother to go around one of the largest, which is situated directly in the middle of the path.  An ancient towering rosewood tree is here.

The road is almost non-existent. The many large granite boulders that cover the path evidence the instability of the mountains to the north and south. The merchants who travel this road have erected a series of shoddy road signs to direct travelers safely around the boulders. Several of these signs point away from a shadowy area just off the side of the road. The rocks of the area seem to hang over the road slightly, blocking out the light. Light colored stringy material is barely visible along the side of the path.  A flimsy wooden sign, a flimsy wooden sign, and a craggy overhang are here.

A large number of horses, carts, and merchants are congregated off the side of the road. They are either preparing for the journey down the cliff to the southwest, or are resting from the trip in the opposite direction.

Small low-lying bushes with bright red berries dominate this stretch of the road. Many birds of various sizes and colors hop from bush to bush, chirping pleasantly as they feast upon the berries.

The cliff face to the north is wet, but there is no apparent source of the moisture. A slight overhang also creates a near permanent shadow in the area, providing a perfect atmosphere for the dense lichen that covers the rocks. Sporadic tufts of grass futilely attempt to assert themselves against the multi-colored lichen, but the spongy fungus prevails. Strange looking spiders scurry about amongst the lichen-covered rocks, before disappearing over the top of the cliff.

There is an extremely large crevasse in the roadway that would normally prevent any further travel along this road. Astoundingly, someone has constructed a very sturdy looking bridge using two perfectly chiseled granite blocks. The blocks make up the support for the bridge structure, which is also constructed of chiseled granite slabs. There is seemingly no explanation for the excellent condition of this stretch of the road.  A sturdy granite bridge is here.

A large gap in the roadway is now spanned by a rickety looking wood and rope bridge. The slats seem to be spaced just close enough so that a wagon wheel does not get lodged between them. The remnants of the foundations of an old stone bridge are evident on both sides of this gap. A few hundred feet below the present bridge, the former one is visible in several pieces. Considering the state of the old bridge, this unstable replacement does not exactly inspire feelings of safety.  A decrepit looking wood and rope bridge is here.

A large pile of unexplained wooden crates and barrels have been tossed unceremoniously in an alcove off the side of the main road. They have all been scavenged long ago and simply lie abandoned by their owners. For hundreds of feet in either direction, the road surface is covered in deep grooves, making wagon travel quite hazardous. Even at a slow pace the vibrations are intense enough to damage cargo. This is made evident as a heavily laden wagon shudders down the slope. Swearing loudly, the merchant tosses what sounds like a crate full of broken glass into the alcove before continuing onward.  A pile of wooden crates and barrels is here.

The poor construction of this road becomes quickly evident. Water is flowing down over the sides of the cliff above and across the road surface. Due to the slight slope of the road toward the deep chasm to the south, this section of road is quite hazardous. Many broken pieces of rope and metal spikes are strewn all over the pathway; evidently failed attempts to keep wagons from sliding over the side. Large piles of heavy looking stones have now been stacked along the edge of the gorge in hopes it will prevent trade carts from careening off the edge. Several of these stones seem to be missing. Evidently the idea is not working as well as was hoped.  A large pile of stones and a large pile of stones are here.

Large and very unsteady wooden boards have been placed across the gaps, creating makeshift bridges. Many of the boards have a significant curve to them, suggesting that they may have been the victim of a rather large traveler.

A large gap in the roadway is now spanned by a rickety looking wood and rope bridge. The slats seem to be spaced just close enough so that a wagon wheel does not get lodged between them. The remnants of the foundations of an old stone bridge are evident on both sides of this gap. A few hundred feet below the present bridge, the former one is visible in several pieces. Considering the state of the old bridge, this unstable replacement does not exactly inspire feelings of safety.  A decrepit looking wood and rope bridge is here.

A large pile of unexplained wooden crates and barrels have been tossed unceremoniously in an alcove off the side of the main road. They have all been scavenged long ago and simply lie abandoned by their owners. For hundreds of feet in either direction, the road surface is covered in deep grooves, making wagon travel quite hazardous. Even at a slow pace the vibrations are intense enough to damage cargo. This is made evident as a heavily laden wagon shudders down the slope. Swearing loudly, the merchant tosses what sounds like a crate full of broken glass into the alcove before continuing onward.  A pile of wooden crates and barrels is here.

The poor construction of this road becomes quickly evident. Water is flowing down over the sides of the cliff above and across the road surface. Due to the slight slope of the road toward the deep chasm to the south, this section of road is quite hazardous. Many broken pieces of rope and metal spikes are strewn all over the pathway; evidently failed attempts to keep wagons from sliding over the side. Large piles of heavy looking stones have now been stacked along the edge of the gorge in hopes it will prevent trade carts from careening off the edge. Several of these stones seem to be missing. Evidently the idea is not working as well as was hoped.  A large pile of stones and a large pile of stones are here.

The cliff face to the north is slightly more sloped than others, allowing far more vegetation to grow on it. Small shapes are visible scurrying about among the grasses and shrubs, most of them reacting to any movement on the road. A few are visible up the road ahead, but quickly vanish at the distant screech of a raptor. It is a few moments before they curiously return.  Some small cute striped chipmunks are here.

Despite the fact the cliffs to the north are nearly vertical, various plants still cling to life against them. Many are common weeds or merely grasses, but some are delicate wildflowers, leaving little or no explanation as to their presence on the cliff. One small tree is also attempting to take root along the cliffside, its branches jutting out at odd angles.  An oddly shaped rosewood tree is here.

Two picturesque snow-capped mountain peaks come together in the distance for a lower pass through their forested bases. The white glint of a distant waterfall glistens amongst the green backdrop. The granite road below you continues its precarious trek eastward up the cliffside.

Just to the south is the juncture where old merchant road connected to this new road. Just beyond that is the deep gorge that has swallowed up the old road. The road surface is a stable solid rock, but is barely large enough for a single wagon to pass through. Unlike the new merchant road to the southwest, this road follows a more natural flow up the eastern cliffside carefully traversing the steep mountain. A single yellow wildflower grows defiantly out of the rocky cliff, giving a stark contrast to the solid grey that surrounds it.  A small yellow wildflower is here.

A lone carrion bird seems to stare from the branches of a gnarled old tree. The road surface alternates between the usual hard-packed dirt covered in gravel, and solid rock. The terrain creates even more difficult travel for those heading north or south. A large pile of broken wagons, barrels, and boxes lie quite some distance below. Many skeletons of pack animals, picked clean by carrion birds, are also discernible. It is highly likely some of the bones are Humanoid as well.

The road ascends upward at a rather severe angle towards the northwest combined with the shifting road surface, it makes this particular passage very difficult for any merchants traveling with a large quantity of goods. A swiftly flowing river is visible several hundred feet below, and it can only be assumed that it was the cause of the collapse of old merchant road. The audible roar of the river is evident, even this far above.

The old merchant road lies in pieces at the bottom of a deep gorge far below. An artificial pathway has been constructed in the wake of the recent collapse, allowing continued passage through the mountains. This new merchant road has been constructed in great haste and is still quite unstable. Gravel that has been spread on the road to make it safer, is actually making it far more precarious. Pebbles roll continuously off of the roads surface and down into the chasm below.

A treacherous dusty trail leads west along the shaky fault line from a fork in the main road. The original roadbed has fallen into the chasm years ago, leaving the merchants to their own wiles to ply the slippery slopes past the fault zone. Many attempts have failed at conquering the shifting dirt and rocks. Currently a bumpy trail skirts the bigger rocks and loose gravel.

As the merchant road approaches the western end of the valley, the valley wall abruptly falls away to a sheer drop. Crumbling rock and dirt spill constantly into the deep abyss. Sections of the mountain have slid away into the valley and the merchant road has been rebuilt higher along the steeper sides of the mountain. The fault line of broken rocks continues its path of destruction to the west, skirted by the land-slide prone softer dirt.   A freshly uncovered crevice is here.

A short tremor suddenly rocks the cracked merchant road! A dusty pall sifts into the air from cracks in the ground and the shifting of gravel around the valley.  The tremor rolls through the canyon walls like a ripple, as if it were a linen sheet that was lifted and settled again. Pack animals and travelers alike stop momentarily and then hasten their pace as if to leave the quake behind them.

Sheer, monolithic cliffs dropping for thousands of feet front the western edge of the mountains; their sharp, snow-capped peaks vaulting nearly vertically from the floor of the fault line valley. The merchant road bed is cracked and broken as it negotiates the larger twists and turns.

The momentous forces that have wrought this valley still press upon the land and have done so for eons.  The walls of the valley are sheer and steep, and untouched by the raging waters of river or stream.  As if in testimony to the power of the forces that move the land, a huge dark boulder sits off to the side of the road. It is hewn in half like a sliced melon.  One part sits 20 feet north along the break in the rocks from the other part.

Soft sandstone has been stripped away to form an arch in the valley wall ... a concave indention that goes for hundreds of feet in both directions.  Within the hardened sediment left ages ago upon the land are treasures beyond value: fossilized shells by the thousands, in all sizes, shapes and colors.

The merchant road threads through bottom of the small, narrow valley. Sheer granite walls block the view from the well traveled road to either side and above, only a narrow ray of sky testifies to the time of day. The engineers set a route as far as possible from the broken stones in the center of the valley and, by luck or design, this foresight has saved the road-bed from constant reconstruction. Small cracks run parallel to the road, but none have broken through the thick layers of sand and stone.

The sandy soil of the steppe has been ripped away to reveal its intimate underpinnings.  The matted roots of the prairie grasses desperately hold into what little dirt they can while below in wide layers, the rocks and dirt tell the story of the plateau and the surrounding foothills. Each striation varies in texture, composition and color. They are an open book for those with the specific knowledge to read it.

The merchant road dips down into a small valley with steep walls, cutting across the incline like a switch-back to reduce the grade.  This long but narrow canyon is tree-less and full of gravel and broken rocks. As if to emphasize the strangeness of the sheered rocks, a line of split stone expands across the very center of the valley.

The choice to remove hundreds of feet of hillside was more prudent to the road engineers then a long series of switch-backs that would have to climb the steep hillside for hundreds of feet. Tube shaped holes drilled into the bedrock still remain from when the roadbed was blasted eons ago.

This flat part of the road that follows the valley floor would be prone to turn into a muddy bog and therefore a hazard to most caravans and their pack animals. Anticipating this event, the road's engineers built drains into the lower side of the road that carry the runoff into the culvert, which carries it harmlessly down to the low end of the valley.

The metal grey river deposits a sandbar on its western bank near the merchant road, causing a snag of dead logs, branches and floating debris. A cat sized rodent, with long teeth, flat tail and webbed toes peaks briefly over the jumbled tangle of branches before dipping back into the frigid water without a splash.

The raging silver-cast river cuts through the grassland and heads southeast. Fishing boats, bearing the crest of the city of Spur, dart around several barges laden with exotic wares to trade in the merchant city. Most bear the purple livery of the city of Rathan, but every so often a ship flying unfamiliar colors can be sighted.

Just to the north, the roadway curves gently around a bend in a large river that flows towards the southeast. An enormous smooth round rock splits off a small eddy from the main current resulting a deep, clear pool by the eastern side of the road. The cool calm water catches the reflection of the white snowcapped mountain range further up the valley while the river rushes past towards Spur. Five fishermen recline on folding chairs or against rocks, tethered by the silvery lines of their poles to the fishing hole. Each fisherman is spread evenly around the pool as if held apart by some invisible barrier as they eye the large shadowy fish shapes finning effortlessly against the mild current in the eddy.

Empty wooden crates, broken harnesses, damaged pottery, and the usual byproducts of food preparation fill an impromptu refuse pile adjacent to two campsites. Both two and four legged scavengers ply through the pile, scattering it further and enlarging the boundary. The result is a landmark of incongruous shapes, colors and shadows along the otherwise bland sweep of grasslands through which the roadway travels.

Broadening to fill the lee of a wide valley, the roadway passes by several temporary campsites where caravans have bolstered the existing comforts for their temporary encampments. Neat stacks of foraged sticks and axe-hewn firewood sit adjacent to the blackened rocks of two impromptu fire rings. Freshly dug midden pits waft clues to the camp's frequent use into the clean mountain air.

The worn merchants road travels the southern side of a low hill in one wide arc. The broad path is slightly banked to accomodate for the turn and incline. On the exposed side of the road, the sturdy road-bed is exposed to the elements and yet has remained solid. A neatly kept plank house with a stone well and fenced paddock overlooks grain fields to the southeast.

The road charges across a flat valley through waving stalks of grain with coppery tinted seeds. Around the northern edge grows a row of huge cypress trees with trunks that measure eight feet across. Debris from the trees' self-trimming mats the taller grasses into an impenetrable wall. The cypresses produce the necessary windbreak for the field to bear the heavy headed grain.

As the road bends around a curve, ruts left by merchant's wagons cut so deeply into the mud that all wheeled vehicles are forced to follow the set path. Four loaded wagons of a merchants caravan stand idle as one larger than standard wagon skitters along the path. The buckboard's frame groans and strains to keep it inline while the driver attempts to negotiate the turn. Four dark maned, matched mules balk at the noise behind them, and stomp nervously over the deep ruts. The liveried caravan guards attempt to haul the mules forward, further adding to the mules stubborn refusal to move.

Aged and splintered into the vague circular shape, a decaying wagon wheel is left to rot in the grass by the roadside. Their roots protectively sheltered from the weather, idiosyntric sprouts of taller grasses thrive haphazardly inside the wheel. Several tiny holes top small pyramids of sandy debris, where a few red fire ants scout their wagon-wheel domain for fodder.

The travel-worn road dips and curves around the low lying foothills. Each pass over the top of hillsides presents a new view of the mountain range. Each dip into small valleys reveal minute eco-systems that exist in each wagon wheel rut where water collects. Splayed avion tracks dot the dried mud in random order permanently recording the hunters conquest of lesser things from the mud and moss.

The road diverts around a small pool of murky water that lies to the north. A confusion of hoof prints muddies the shoreline where the placid bovines have come to water themselves. The pool is damned by a small hillock which allows no drainage so the pool remains stagnant. The mountains to the north reflect in perfectly upside-down symmetry on the still pond's surface, only wavering slightly in concentric circles to the deft touch of small insects.

A rickety criss-crossed rough beam fence pens the grazing of black and white cows whose ponderous forms are barely visible through the tall grass on either side of the road. To the north, the soft, undulating grassland floor of the wide valley succumbs to the rolling foothills, which in turn delineates the imposing outline of a vista-spanning mountain range. Many a traveler has witnessed this idyllic vantage point and has been drawn on to follow the road that travels into the heart of the mountains.

The tall, shaded forest breaks like a green tinged wave upon the tranquil calm of the grasslands. The huge trees within are ancient, reaching hundreds of feet into the air. As if steaming from a great cauldron, a heavy ground fog seeps from deep within the forest carrying with it the fresh smell of decomposing green matter.

Travelers from Rathan to the northwest, and the Trade Route to the south, converge at Spur's west gate. Guards posted on the ground give those seeking to enter the city a cursory once-over. Their lack of interest shows that anyone approaching has already been observed from above for some time. A grate in the ground loosens mud from wagon wheels and hooves before they pass through the gate, helping to keep the streets of Spur fairly clean.

Behind a tall counter a well-dressed female with a short beard takes new orders and scurries to retrieve items for pickup. Behind her, industrious Hithuals work at several forges, filling the stout building with noise and smoke. Specializing in the repairing of old damaged equipment for adventurers, their services are in high demand. Their quality and quick turn over has earned them enough coin to garner one of the prime locations in the Spur.  A giant iron anvil, a wooden sign, and a heavy mahogany door are here.

The buildings of Market Circle stand to the south. It becomes obvious that the area through the arch is a much cleaner marketplace than the bazaar. An inviting eatery stands beside the road, its door open to those weary after a long trip to Spur, as well as those preparing to venture to the great expanses beyond the west gate. A human couple exit the building, arm in arm. A small sign stands beside the intersection.  A sign, an open glossy lacquered oak door, and a street lantern are here.

Adventurers with sacks of plundered goods leave Market Street and head west where a shrewd businessman has set up shop in this busy area of the Market District. A small shop stands slightly to the east of the arch leading into Merchant Circle, light shining through its red glass door and illuminating the store front in a cheerful, ruby glow.  A street lantern, an opaque ruby red glass door, and a gold lettered wooden sign are here.

An arch between two large buildings connects Market Circle and Market Street. The more reputable shopkeepers do business within the circle, but pay higher taxes for the privilege. The buildings have been built to last, as these merchants are no traveling tinkers. Interlocking stone walkways and colorful plantings span this central area. Despite the number of animals waiting outside the bank for their owners, the area is spotless. Loud chatter in many languages can be heard from the southwest.  A marble archway, an open elegant gold-trimmed walnut door, and a wooden sign are here.

Many townsfolk pass along this busy thoroughfare. Rich and poor alike mix freely on this street, much to the dismay of a passing nobleman. A young human struggles with an armful of packages and two young children in tow.

A large gate separates the Merchant District and Town Square-the hub of Spur's activity. The partially opened gate is currently able to accommodate the simultaneous passage of several locals and visitors, but can be expanded to accept carriages, or sealed to ward against invasion.  Guards stand sentry from atop the wall as well as the ground.  A street lantern is here.

Merchant Walk comes to an abrupt end at a massive moonsilver gate. The towering walls of Spur on either side of the gates force all to pass by the guards who are constantly on the watch for thieves and bandits.

Several city guardsmen have just finished wrestling to the ground some young tough thieves, who thought to rob one of the returning merchants. To one side a relieved-looking Fir Elf gentleman holds on tightly to his gold-tipped walking stick, as the human boy yells his innocence to any who might listen. His pleas fall on deaf ears as the guards drag him away.  A street lantern is here.

People carrying bundles stream in from the west and rapidly lose themselves in the large crowds moving about in the vast town square.

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.  A flowing white marble fountain, a marble statue of a Human, a shimmering marble statue of a Dragon, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a rosewood sign, and a crisp gold lettered vellum notice are here.
