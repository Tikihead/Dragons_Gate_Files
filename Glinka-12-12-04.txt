Softly twinkling cutout snowflakes cast a thousand flickering lights on the smooth surface of the ice castle. Silver stars hang from the ceiling, shimmering as they twirl with the swirling wind. A crescent shaped moon hangs from the center of the cathedral ceiling as couples, clad in deep, rich velvets and furs, spiral and dance as they glide across the ice.  A glowing snow covered evergreen tree, a snowflake filigree ice bridge of love, and a bubbling dove-etched fountian are here.

Elegant twists of violet and silk form an airy canopy, as pure white roses entwine delicately around the intricately carved walls of the ice castle, creating a beautiful scene against the backdrop of winter. Twinkling garlands of stars drape the silks, allowing the icy ceiling to be open to the starlit heavens. Fragrant candles flicker, casting a soft halo on the smooth floor of ice.  A glowing snow covered evergreen tree is here.

Decorated with fragrant candles and garlands of dried leaves and berries, this small wagon exudes a truly festive feeling. Plush crimson red velvet floor cushions surround a small wooden table, which has intricate autumn scenes carved into its surface. A small stage rests in the northern corner for merchants to show off their wares.  Some deep crimson velvet pillows, an ornate wooden table, a deep red velvet curtain, an open round mahogany door, a sparkling hair prices sign, a rosewood length list, a carved maple styles list, an inky textures for hair list, a Book of Specialties, a cheerful red eye prices list, and a gold-trimmed shapes for eyes list are here.

As the snow falls softly on the trees, the heavens' lights give the white blanket a glistening luster like tiny gems are embroidered into the chilling cover. The light crunching of snow sounds as small animals scurry quickly through the forest. A golden glow radiates from the windows of a small stone cottage as a fire blazes inside. Shimmering swirled icicles hang over the doorway, which leads into the warm abode, and stacks of firewood rest on either side of the entryway.  An open round mahogany cottage door, a decorated colorful fir tree, and a glowing crystal street lantern are here.

Fragrant, ribbon tied, bunches of holly and mistletoe are carefully placed along a long pine fence, which lines the frozen pond. Several sitting benches are placed all about and under the snowcapped trees. Crackling, magickal fires roar all around and send sparks of light up into the air. A tall arch, carved with delicate images of snowflakes, snow Secians, and lined with living snowbells, leads the way to the pond beyond.  A tall carved archway, a glowing crystal street lantern, and a fluffy white snowball are here.

They combine with the distinctive smell of hot metal that comes from the forge.

Softly twinkling cutout snowflakes cast a thousand flickering lights on the smooth surface of the ice castle. Silver stars hang from the ceiling, shimmering as they twirl with the swirling wind. A crescent shaped moon hangs from the center of the cathedral ceiling as couples, clad in deep, rich velvets and furs, spiral and dance as they glide across the ice.  A glowing snow covered evergreen tree, a snowflake filigree ice bridge of love, a bubbling dove-etched fountian, and some vomit are here.

Rainbows of tiny morsels overflow from crystal jars, as steam billows from the mugs of hot rum cocoa and spiced apple ciders. Dressed in a blue apron, a chubby amethyst Drag-al stands behind the wooden counter that is decorated festively with garlands as he mixes up a new cake. Baskets of freshly baked pastries and breads tantalize the senses as delicious temptations, while a few cheerfully dressed Secians bustle around the green cloth covered tables, filling mugs and delivering treats to their hungry patrons.

[Crystal Snowflake Village, Candy Cottage.]

A gnarled willow tree stands like a towering sentinel over a small candy striped cottage. The tree's long, languid branches shimmer festively as the wind blows furiously, carrying on it the dulcet scent of peppermint, cinnamon, spices, and chocolate. A misty trail of white smoke billows steadily in ruffled rings from a stone chimney. As the sweet smell intoxicates the air, a small circle of children giggles and dances around a small pine tree, decorated with paper streamers and ornaments.  A twinkling ice wreath of Rathene roses, an open pink heart-shaped wooden door, a pair of dancing snow people, a glowing crystal street lantern, and a fluffy white snowball are here.

A soft glow warms the earth as the heavens' celestial orb casts a halo of light upon the snowy village. The chiming of bells mingles with the merry song of carolers as the wind twists and curls through the chilled air.  A cheerful snowman, a glowing crystal street lantern, a dove emblazoned banner on a silver pole, some flowing violet silk streamers, a fluffy white snow drift, a dove shaped sign, and a dove etched pearl arch are here.

Festive laughter flies through the air on the wings of the wind.  A warm crackling magickal fire, a blackened stone tower door, and a fluffy white snowball are here.

To the right of the door is a small window, its opening covered with metal bars. An old man, missing most of his teeth, waits patiently for the travelers to pay their fare, and then directs them into the waiting area. On the east side of the road a billowing multicolored tent has been erected, the hustle and bustle of merchants and customers can be seen coming and going at all times of the day.

[Rinannimas Festival, Crystal Snowflake Village.]

Glistening pathways of snow-covered cobblestone swirl and spin through an enchanted landscape of winter. Lace patterned snowflakes fall from the silver gray sky, blanketing the naked branches of trees which are ornamented with tiny twinkling lights. A soft glow warms the earth as the heavens' celestial orb casts a halo of light upon the snowy village. The chiming of bells mingles with the merry song of carolers as the wind twists and curls through the chilled air.  A cheerful snowman, a glowing crystal street lantern, a dove emblazoned banner on a silver pole, some flowing violet silk streamers, a fluffy white snow drift, a dove shaped sign, and a dove etched pearl arch are here.

A narrow trail, covered in a light dusting of snow, ribbons itself through a maze of decorated trees that frame the wayside of a cobblestone path which curls and winds through the forest. Nestled under the trees, a tall blackened brick tower rests to the side of the path. Shimmering garlands of stars and moons decorate the frame of the door that leads inside. Festive laughter flies through the air on the wings of the wind.  A warm crackling magickal fire and a blackened stone tower door are here.

Towering trees, baron of leaves, creak as gust of wind move their aging branches. Gleaming fresh fallen snow rest gently in their arms. Perched above, a snowy owl, calls out suddenly towards those below. A gentle wind whines a slow, lingering song as the path winds itself towards the entrance of a quaint black velvet tent.
