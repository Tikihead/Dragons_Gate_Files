[Town Square South.]

The outward appearance of the people here seems a bit classier. Rich clothing and large coin purses are prevalent amongst the travelers. In fact, many of the folk heading into Town Square from the south are accompanied by large bodyguards to assure their safety. The well maintained road is lined with small brass lanterns, each swinging off an individual pole.  A street lantern is here.

This area is illuminated.
In the area are Dalton the Noble Secian and Kelstar the Noble Draco.

[Southern Avenue.]

Smooth stones make up the street that leads from the center of Spur to the south. Each stone has been carefully fitted for the most comfortable travel by both cart and traveler alike. A well dressed Guard patrols the area in his dress uniform. Captains don't allow for slovenly appearances on this patrol.  A street lantern is here.

[Southern Avenue.]

Southern Avenue leads between the center of Spur and the homes of the prosperous and wealthy. Several of the Ladies of the city stroll along the avenue chatting about the current events and latest gossip of the Spur. Behind them, harried servants carry their reticules and all those belongings that they cannot be without.  A street lantern is here.

[Southern Avenue.]

Vast estates tower over the huge Spurian wall towards the south. The well-to-do who live in these homes idle away their days, enjoying the luxury of time. Standing next to a very empty lantern pole, a small Flerian child insists in a plaintive wail, that he had nothing to do with the missing lantern. The well-dressed guard that interrogates him keeps pointing at a small sack on the ground and its obvious contents.  An open small burlap sack, a street lantern, and a lantern are here.

[Southern Avenue & Gorey Street.]

The boughs of a large apple tree hang over the well tended avenue. Below the beautiful tree stands a small fountain. Atop the fountain is an intricately carved Secian who appears to be dancing with the water as it splashes around her. Set in the marble base is a small plaque that reads, "For those who have gone before us." Many stand for a moment as they pass this way, giving thanks for the gift of life that is given by both the apple tree and the Secians of long ago. Large piles of dirt and broken stone lay on either side of the street as workmen ready the east and west alleys for expansion.  A street lantern, a closed Secian etched moonsilver door, a pair of open silver forged swinging doors, and a sign above the doors are here.

[Southern Avenue.]

Standing next to the large iron gate that separates the center of town from those of the elite class are several of the Spurian Guard. They are here to assist all who pass with the simple kindness of opening a gate, or the more important task of escorting those in need to the bank or market. A young looking cadet rubs wax into the stones of the city wall, his task is daunting, but one that will teach him discipline.  An open iron gate and a street lantern are here.

Obvious paths: north*.

You follow Kelstar through an open iron gate...

[Gateway.]

An elegant, carved wooden sign hangs above the ornate gateway set into the massive wall that divides Spurs Noble District from the Town Square. You can make out city guardsmen peering down attentively at all that approach from their posts atop the imposing wall. They seem to take a greater interest in this part of town, though there does not seem to be anything threatening enough here to warrant such attention.  A street lantern, an open iron gate, and a gilded silver plaque are here.

[Noble Way.]

To the north, you can make out an ornately scrolled gateway set in the base of the imposing city wall. The refined roadway of Noble Way stretches out to the south. The cobblestones of the road are smooth and even. The attention to detail shown here is a dramatic change from some of the other parts of the city.  A street lantern is here.

[Noble Way.]

An unusually large home, even for this part of town, lies off to the west. It seems as if one ambitious owner is slowly buying up the lots next to his and adding them to his own. Groundskeepers are at work in the surrounding gardens, trimming and raking, so intent on their work they do not bother to acknowledge the passing traffic on the road.  A street lantern is here.

This area is illuminated.
In the area are Dalton the Noble Secian and Kelstar the Noble Draco.
Obvious paths: north* southwest*.

You follow Kelstar southwest...

[Noble Way.]

Many grand, even ostentatious, homes line this stretch of Noble Way. Most of the residents here were fortunate enough to be born into the right families. Few that live in this area have ever actually had to work for a living. Glancing at the nameplates reveals many of the recognizable names of the Spur. Some of these names could almost be considered famous.  A street lantern is here.

[Noble Way.]

Noble Way continues to wind its way among the rather modestly sized, but elegant, homes of the Spur's successful. Many a peasant farmer may live in homes larger than these, but none can match the quality found here. A peaceful, luxurious feeling pervades this part of town; perhaps it is the drifting floral scents wafting from the well-tended gardens.  A closed elegant black iron gate and a street lantern are here.

Gazing down each of the nearby private drives reveals a glimpse of a luxurious home, each a miniature estate in its own right. Short, stout walls and manicured hedges serve to keep out the riffraff and to protect the small, expensive gardens. Every detail has been attended to display the exotic plants, in all their pampered perfection.  A street lantern and a closed rosewood door are here.

[Noble Way.]

Leaving the exceptionally wealthy estates of the Spurian nobility, Noble Way heads toward the Town Square to the northwest. Along the roadside can be seen the in-city homes of successful merchants and other wealthy citizens of the Spur. The homes display a slightly different style, perhaps they are not quite so restrained; a touch more exuberance and freedom with materials is displayed.  A street lantern is here.

[Intersection.]

The avenue comes to a fork, with Noble Way curving from south to the northwest. A side-street heading off to the east leads to an extremely well kept neighborhood that easily surpasses everything around it in splendor and magnificence. Everything, even the carefully pruned trees and the manicured shrubbery displays a desire for elegant perfection.  A street lantern is here.

This area is illuminated.
You see the 1st mounted city guard, the 2nd mounted city guard, and the 1st bodyguard.

[Noble Way.]

The entire avenue is composed of fine cobblestone, each level with its neighbor, providing a smooth ride for passing carriages and horses. The stones were customized by craftsmen, cut to order, rather than simply placed wherever they might fit. A few stately oaks and elms line the sides of the road, shading travelers during the daylight hours.  A street lantern is here.

Numerous trees lining the avenue serve as the dividing border between the majestic estates of the nobility and the lightly traveled roadway. The estates themselves are noticeably closer to the avenue than those to the south. However, they are no easier to access, still protected by their own guarding walls, some covered with ivy or colorful blooming vines.  A street lantern is here.

Occasional gates and driveways lead back into the well-kept estates of the city's nobility, breaking and adding interest to the defining plane of the walls lining Noble Way. The rest of the street seems to mimic the splendor of the estates beyond the wall. Swept and trimmed, the roadway exudes a simple, yet beautiful elegance.  A street lantern is here.

[Noble Crossroads.]

A small roadway bordered by flowering hedges bisects the wide avenue of Noble Way at a right angle, heading east to west.  A thick, sturdy sign stands just off to the side of a charming path, its large friendly letters intent on luring travelers into the city's premiere roadstay, the Gilded Lion Inn. The entrance is clearly marked and welcoming, extending off to the southeast.  A wooden sign and a street lantern are here.

[Noble Way.]

Majestic elms continue to line this broad roadway, sheltering the avenue on both sides and further enhancing the grandiose atmosphere. Fronting the beautiful homes, cobbled paths edged with narrow flower beds meander through nearby private gardens. Though they appear wonderful places to spend an afternoon or take a picnic, the glances from those tending the estates makes it clear they are only for the invited.  A street lantern is here.

The occasional locked gate marks the entrance to some of the more hidden estates of Spurs nobility. From this broad avenue, little can be seen of their splendor. Behind the imposing gate recedes a proud drive, disappearing mysteriously into the trees. If not for the large imposing tower rising above the hedges it would be hard to discern anything was beyond the gate. It is apparent the residents do not wish to be disturbed.  A street lantern, a closed morbius door, and an open black iron gate are here.

Dalton asks Glinka, "are you very good at turning?"

You follow Kelstar south...

[South Gate.]

A well-guarded gateway separates the city's residential district from the farmlands just beyond. Guards carefully eye all that enter or exit the city, beckoning gruffly to random travelers for a closer inspection. The structure of the guards' barracks is visible above the road to the west. A weathered wooden sign is posted by the gate.  A closed stone gate, a wooden sign, a street lantern, and an open thick stone door are here.

[South gate.]

Through the gate lies the city of Spur, the major center of trade and civilization on the plains. The dusty road leading through the gates is well traveled, and walls of the city are in good repair. A small shack sits to the west of the road, during most times of the day a dusty coach can be seen waiting in front, its horses stomping with impatience to be gone. To the right of the door is a small window, its opening covered with metal bars. An old man, missing most of his teeth, waits patiently for the travelers to pay their fare, and then directs them into the waiting area. On the east side of the road a billowing multicolored tent has been erected, the hustle and bustle of merchants and customers can be seen coming and going at all times of the day.  A rainbow silk tent and an open iron gate are here.

[Road.]

Even though it shows heavy wear, the road is in remarkably good repair. It was built by expert craftsmen to withstand the rigors of time and use. Evidence of recent repairs indicate that any problems are dealt with quickly and competently.  Some dried crimson streaks of blood and a broken old wooden trash wagon are here.

[Field.]

A broad strip of grassland that follows the main road east of you, this meadow is often used by the local aristocracy for picnicking and partying on good days. The city guardsmen keep the field clear of riffraff all year round, just to be safe.  A hole is here.

A tall bridge spans the Darkith to the docks on the far side. The docks on this side of the river spread out to the north while the offices of the Seamen's Guild are through a door to the south. A gate also leads to Spur's fairground to the south.  A bridge, an open wooden door, and an open gleaming red and green iron gate are here.

The rickety dock gives way to soft packed soil.  A freshly made path cuts through the dense forest vegetation to the west. The smell of fresh lumber wafts through the air. A large magnificent building has been built next to the last step of the docks. Travelers pause and take a glance into the beautiful window front of the building, their pleasure at seeing such nice items is evident on their faces.  Some flapping colorful flags, a ship shaped rosewood hanging sign, and an open dazzling painted lemonwood door are here.

[Gavren Forest, Path]

Large branches hang down from above, casting dark shadows across the forest floor.  With every rustle of the breeze they seem to take on a life of their own, almost to the point of distracting you from the deep ravine that lies ahead, obscured by the gnarly undergrowth.  A mossy rotting log, a crooked crumbling stone bridge, and a dark path are here.

You find yourself at the edge of what appears to be an extremely dense forest.  The trees here have grown so tall that they permit no light to break through their expanse.  No plants can possibly grow on the ground in these inhospitable conditions, and only various fungi and lichen seem to be thriving.  Some giant spotted mushrooms and a crooked crumbling stone bridge are here.

The trees here are quite different from those that are thriving in the rest of the forest.  The long, leafy branches hang so low that they almost form a wall, blocking your view of anything nearby.

The wall of leaves to the southeast seclude this grotto from the rest of the forest, yet they are still the easiest way in and out of here, since a sturdy wall prohibits you from making any further progress to the northwest.

The darkness seems to go on and on as you find yourself more deeply immersed in this dark wood.  The deeper you go, the more claustrophobic it gets.  It's almost as if the trees are closing in on you.

Creaking and snapping sounds descend upon you from above.  The darkness makes it impossible to make out anything but the branches immediately overhead.  Perhaps it is just an owl or a bat.  Then again, maybe not.

The trees are thinner here, as the terrain becomes more rocky.  Boulders lie scattered about, some shattered, from what must have been a long fall from above.  A skeleton lies partially exposed under one of the boulders, obviously a victim of some rockslide.  Perhaps you should take care to avoid the same fate.  A giant corroded granite boulder and a decayed bleached skeleton are here.

[Dark Woods, Rocky Trail]

The trees are thinner here, as the terrain becomes more rocky.  Boulders lie scattered about, some shattered, from what must have been a long fall from above.  A skeleton lies partially exposed under one of the boulders, obviously a victim of some rockslide.  Perhaps you should take care to avoid the same fate.  A giant corroded granite boulder and a decayed bleached skeleton are here.

This area is illuminated.
You see the 1st chaos-infected oak dryad and the 1st chaos elemental.
In the area is Dalton the Noble Secian (flying 20 feet above you).

Travelers from Rathan to the northwest, and the Trade Route to the south, converge at Spur's west gate. Guards posted on the ground give those seeking to enter the city a cursory once-over. Their lack of interest shows that anyone approaching has already been observed from above for some time. A grate in the ground loosens mud from wagon wheels and hooves before they pass through the gate, helping to keep the streets of Spur fairly clean.  A closed giant black iron gate, a giant green oak tree, a small blue pool, a thick oak grate over the pool, and a polished stone marker are here.

For a small price, a farmer can rent a booth and directly market his goods. Both some of the best and some of the worst deals can be made within this collection of stalls.

An old Thugian pulls and pushes a very stubborn donkey. Neither end seems to be cooperating with his demands.

Standing on the western side of the road is a small stall filled with beakers and assorted philters. Exotic potions of both the mundane and magical variety are being offered for sale. Standing on either side of the stall door are two rather large Thugian guards, the merchant takes no chances with his special concoctions.  A sign, an open stall, and a street lantern are here.

The well-defined Bazaar path heads off to the west. This corner is a mix of the old and the new. On one corner an old stall is barely standing. The roof has caved in, and it quickly becomes apparent that this location has become a local dump. Pieces of wood that look suspiciously like some of the leftovers from other construction sites are piled on top of rotting offal. On the opposite corner a new tent is being erected, its high roof and vivid coloring pleasing to the eye.  An open stall and a street lantern are here.

An old Thugian pulls and pushes a very stubborn donkey. Neither end seems to be cooperating with his demands. Two small children dance around the Thugian and the donkey, chanting and singing a nasty song. Quickly, he takes out a switch, which is enough encouragement for both the donkey to move and the children to run.  A street lantern is here.

Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.  A flowing white marble fountain, a marble statue of a Human, a shimmering marble statue of a Dragon, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a rosewood sign, and a crisp gold lettered vellum notice are here.

Travelers from Rathan to the northwest, and the Trade Route to the south, converge at Spur's west gate. Guards posted on the ground give those seeking to enter the city a cursory once-over. Their lack of interest shows that anyone approaching has already been observed from above for some time. A grate in the ground loosens mud from wagon wheels and hooves before they pass through the gate, helping to keep the streets of Spur fairly clean.

The noise and sputum of the big city stains the south eastern horizon through the vague outline of old-growth oaks, maples and cedars.

Lush grass grows up to the borders of a thick, dense forest that cloaks the hills to the west. The grasslands thin near the grove as the huge trees completely shade the ground, and are replaced by taller bushes and juniper trees.

From the west spans a dark green forest of Sycamore and Beech trees that soak in the moister parts of the lower river valley. The tall, shaded forest breaks like a green tinged wave upon the tranquil calm of the grasslands. The huge trees within are ancient, reaching hundreds of feet into the air. As if steaming from a great cauldron, a heavy ground fog seeps from deep within the forest carrying with it the fresh smell of decomposing green matter.

To the north, the soft, undulating grassland floor of the wide valley succumbs to the rolling foothills, which in turn delineates the imposing outline of a vista-spanning mountain range. Many a traveler has witnessed this idyllic vantage point and has been drawn on to follow the road that travels into the heart of the mountains.

The road diverts around a small pool of murky water that lies to the north. A confusion of hoof prints muddies the shoreline where the placid bovines have come to water themselves. The pool is damned by a small hillock which allows no drainage so the pool remains stagnant. The mountains to the north reflect in perfectly upside-down symmetry on the still pond's surface, only wavering slightly in concentric circles to the deft touch of small insects.

Aged and splintered into the vague circular shape, a decaying wagon wheel is left to rot in the grass by the roadside. Their roots protectively sheltered from the weather, idiosyntric sprouts of taller grasses thrive haphazardly inside the wheel. Several tiny holes top small pyramids of sandy debris, where a few red fire ants scout their wagon-wheel domain for fodder.

As the road bends around a curve, ruts left by merchant's wagons cut so deeply into the mud that all wheeled vehicles are forced to follow the set path. Four loaded wagons of a merchants caravan stand idle as one larger than standard wagon skitters along the path. The buckboard's frame groans and strains to keep it inline while the driver attempts to negotiate the turn. Four dark maned, matched mules balk at the noise behind them, and stomp nervously over the deep ruts. The liveried caravan guards attempt to haul the mules forward, further adding to the mules stubborn refusal to move.

The road charges across a flat valley through waving stalks of grain with coppery tinted seeds. Around the northern edge grows a row of huge cypress trees with trunks that measure eight feet across. Debris from the trees' self-trimming mats the taller grasses into an impenetrable wall. The cypresses produce the necessary windbreak for the field to bear the heavy headed grain.

Just to the north, the roadway curves gently around a bend in a large river that flows towards the southeast. An enormous smooth round rock splits off a small eddy from the main current resulting a deep, clear pool by the eastern side of the road. The cool calm water catches the reflection of the white snowcapped mountain range further up the valley while the river rushes past towards Spur. Five fishermen recline on folding chairs or against rocks, tethered by the silvery lines of their poles to the fishing hole. Each fisherman is spread evenly around the pool as if held apart by some invisible barrier as they eye the large shadowy fish shapes finning effortlessly against the mild current in the eddy.

The decaying remains of the bridge workers camp sprawls across this flat valley. To house their draft beasts, the workers constructed small stalls and shelters from rickety boards nailed quixotically to the standing trees. Three brass ring topped posts lie sunk into the grasslands turf, to the south, which was most likely used for tethering grazing animals. Between the posts is a rough stone trough that is filled automatically with water by a rickety mechanical wind mill, whirling lazily in the breeze.

This flat part of the road that follows the valley floor would be prone to turn into a muddy bog and therefore a hazard to most caravans and their pack animals. Anticipating this event, the road's engineers built drains into the lower side of the road that carry the runoff into the culvert, which carries it harmlessly down to the low end of the valley.

Following a ravine in the cliffs of the higher foothills, the merchant road by-passes a jagged rock formation that repeats in a row from north to south for miles.  Like the decaying backbone of a huge creature buried in soil, the shattered rocks points their broken ribs to the northeast.

Following a small ridge of a hill, the merchant road cuts through the west side, protecting it from the gusty winds that barrels down the mountain sides. The tall pine trees that have begun to populate the higher foothills lean away from the mountains due to the wind's continuous blowing.

The merchant road cuts straight through a hill where men and beasts must have toiled to remove tons of blasted rock and dirt. The choice to remove hundreds of feet of hillside was more prudent to the road engineers then a long series of switch-backs that would have to climb the steep hillside for hundreds of feet. Tube shaped holes drilled into the bedrock still remain from when the roadbed was blasted eons ago.

A solid brass smelted road marker was made to fit perfectly into a cylinder carved in a large boulder. The boulder is pure white crystal quartz, fractured and broken into beautiful prisms around the edges, but remains whole and pure in the center. The road marker clearly points out the cardinal directions using four arrows.   A solid brass road marker is here.

Protected by an outcropping of the rocks that tops another high hill, an oasis of vibrant green mosses reveal a small spring that barely dampens the rocky soil. An industrious and thirsty traveler has coaxed the tricklet of water through a small trench that slowly fills a shallow stone basin. The granite basin holds only enough water to fill a few waterbags.

The jagged mountains and snow capped peaks cannot be viewed along this portion of the merchant road, due to the proximity of the range.  Deep valleys and steep hillsides further hinder any vantage points other then straight ahead and behind.  For all intents and purposes, the mountains do not exist in this passage through the rippled land.

The merchant road dips down into a small valley with steep walls, cutting across the incline like a switch-back to reduce the grade.  This long but narrow canyon is tree-less and full of gravel and broken rocks. As if to emphasize the strangeness of the sheered rocks, a line of split stone expands across the very center of the valley.

The sandy soil of the steppe has been ripped away to reveal its intimate underpinnings.  The matted roots of the prairie grasses desperately hold into what little dirt they can while below in wide layers, the rocks and dirt tell the story of the plateau and the surrounding foothills. Each striation varies in texture, composition and color. They are an open book for those with the specific knowledge to read it.

The merchant road threads through bottom of the small, narrow valley. Sheer granite walls block the view from the well traveled road to either side and above, only a narrow ray of sky testifies to the time of day. The engineers set a route as far as possible from the broken stones in the center of the valley and, by luck or design, this foresight has saved the road-bed from constant reconstruction. Small cracks run parallel to the road, but none have broken through the thick layers of sand and stone.

One layer of rock in the steep walls has eroded faster then the harder granite or bedrock above and below it. Soft sandstone has been stripped away to form an arch in the valley wall ... a concave indention that goes for hundreds of feet in both directions.  Within the hardened sediment left ages ago upon the land are treasures beyond value: fossilized shells by the thousands, in all sizes, shapes and colors.

The momentous forces that have wrought this valley still press upon the land and have done so for eons.  The walls of the valley are sheer and steep, and untouched by the raging waters of river or stream.  As if in testimony to the power of the forces that move the land, a huge dark boulder sits off to the side of the road. It is hewn in half like a sliced melon.  One part sits 20 feet north along the break in the rocks from the other part.

The merchant road follows the path of least resistance through the broken, rocky, higher foothills.  What is a well engineered road in the tamer steppe-lands becomes a minor miracle through the rougher hills and valleys. The road bed remains flat and easy to travel despite the rocky terrain. Each incline and decline in the road is fixed to an agreeable grade for most wagons and sleds.

Thin, scraggly junipers suck up what little moisture the soil does manage to hold. The merchant road placidly passes by, untouched by time in the dry environment.

The grassland plateau is embraced by a stand of dark green oak trees so thick that little light passes through the profusion of their many lobed leaves. The forest is ancient and the trunks of the trees bare witness to fires, lightning strikes and the attacks of insects. Large gout-like burls disfigure some of the wide, grey trunks which have grown quietly next to the road for hundreds of years.

The merchant roads widens as it travels another grass swept plateau. The mountain range fills the northern skyline in stark detail. Huge snow capped peaks and rough faced cliffs are close enough to see the individual boulders, waterfalls, and haphazard game trails. Much higher up the great mountainsides a line where trees stop growing gives testament to the altitude. The air is cool.

The roadway takes advantage of a cut in the hill to negotiate a tumbled cliff face. At the top of the hill is a high, flat, steppe grassland, and at the bottom is the edge of the open range. At one point, the road narrows to cross a small stream. Very little mud gathers in the shallows of the stream and the pebbles and rocks glitter like gold as the wagon wheels churn the gravel.

Running parallel to the road is a smooth rock lined trench that channels the road's run-off during rainstorms. This flat part of the road that follows the valley floor would be prone to turn into a muddy bog and therefore a hazard to most caravans and their pack animals. Anticipating this event, the road's engineers built drains into the lower side of the road that carry the runoff into the culvert, which carries it harmlessly down to the low end of the valley.

The decaying remains of the bridge workers camp sprawls across this flat valley. To house their draft beasts, the workers constructed small stalls and shelters from rickety boards nailed quixotically to the standing trees. Three brass ring topped posts lie sunk into the grasslands turf, to the south, which was most likely used for tethering grazing animals. Between the posts is a rough stone trough that is filled automatically with water by a rickety mechanical wind mill, whirling lazily in the breeze.

Smooth rectangles of tent foundations still mark their location in a semi circle around a blackened fire ring where the workers and their supervisors lived during it's rebuilding.

The newer parts of the huge bridge are obvious due to the contrast in colors of mortar and rock. Bright banners snap briskly in the wind from both ends of the bridge.

An enormous smooth round rock splits off a small eddy from the main current resulting a deep, clear pool by the eastern side of the road. The cool calm water catches the reflection of the white snowcapped mountain range further up the valley while the river rushes past towards Spur. Five fishermen recline on folding chairs or against rocks, tethered by the silvery lines of their poles to the fishing hole. Each fisherman is spread evenly around the pool as if held apart by some invisible barrier as they eye the large shadowy fish shapes finning effortlessly against the mild current in the eddy.

As the road bends around a curve, ruts left by merchant's wagons cut so deeply into the mud that all wheeled vehicles are forced to follow the set path. Four loaded wagons of a merchants caravan stand idle as one larger than standard wagon skitters along the path. The buckboard's frame groans and strains to keep it inline while the driver attempts to negotiate the turn. Four dark maned, matched mules balk at the noise behind them, and stomp nervously over the deep ruts. The liveried caravan guards attempt to haul the mules forward, further adding to the mules stubborn refusal to move.

Aged and splintered into the vague circular shape, a decaying wagon wheel is left to rot in the grass by the roadside. Their roots protectively sheltered from the weather, idiosyntric sprouts of taller grasses thrive haphazardly inside the wheel.

The travel-worn road dips and curves around the low lying foothills. Each pass over the top of hillsides presents a new view of the mountain range. Each dip into small valleys reveal minute eco-systems that exist in each wagon wheel rut where water collects. Splayed avion tracks dot the dried mud in random order permanently recording the hunters conquest of lesser things from the mud and moss.

The road diverts around a small pool of murky water that lies to the north. A confusion of hoof prints muddies the shoreline where the placid bovines have come to water themselves. The pool is damned by a small hillock which allows no drainage so the pool remains stagnant. The mountains to the north reflect in perfectly upside-down symmetry on the still pond's surface, only wavering slightly in concentric circles to the deft touch of small insects.

A rickety criss-crossed rough beam fence pens the grazing of black and white cows whose ponderous forms are barely visible through the tall grass on either side of the road. To the north, the soft, undulating grassland floor of the wide valley succumbs to the rolling foothills, which in turn delineates the imposing outline of a vista-spanning mountain range. Many a traveler has witnessed this idyllic vantage point and has been drawn on to follow the road that travels into the heart of the mountains.

From the west spans a dark green forest of Sycamore and Beech trees that soak in the moister parts of the lower river valley. The tall, shaded forest breaks like a green tinged wave upon the tranquil calm of the grasslands. The huge trees within are ancient, reaching hundreds of feet into the air. As if steaming from a great cauldron, a heavy ground fog seeps from deep within the forest carrying with it the fresh smell of decomposing green matter.

Travelers from Rathan to the northwest, and the Trade Route to the south, converge at Spur's west gate. Guards posted on the ground give those seeking to enter the city a cursory once-over. Their lack of interest shows that anyone approaching has already been observed from above for some time. A grate in the ground loosens mud from wagon wheels and hooves before they pass through the gate, helping to keep the streets of Spur fairly clean.  A closed giant black iron gate, a giant green oak tree, a small blue pool, a thick oak grate over the pool, and a polished stone marker are here.

The spiraling staircase wraps itself tightly around the crystalla column rising through the center of the tower. The smooth stone walls of the structure are solid and lack both windows and ventilation.

A pile of rope, a nest for a few large rats, sits moldy and rotten in the corner. Its frayed, gnawed end drops over the side of the platform and acts as a quick means of escape, if the rats ever get into trouble.  The center gears are easily accessible from this corner, a short distance across the wooden plank.

Grey stone dust lies thickly on everything; boxes, walls, and supplies. Dark black stains run across the floorboards in large rivulets. The dust on some of the crates has been recently disturbed.  Some dusty wooden crates and a weathered pine ladder are here.

Thick oak planks run between braces along the inside perimeter of the clocktower walls. From each corner longer and wider boards stretch to the center mechanism where large chain pulleys and thick hemp rope hang down, far below through the open air. Two massive bronze bells hang below the mechanism on giant chains the size of a thick Thugian. A small ladder passes through the ceiling above the center mechanism.  An open colored glass clockface is here.

Msanychta just picked up a gold coin.

A pale, bluish glow surrounds your fingertips.

You feel a surge of magick infuse your runeweave!

Minute coils of violet draconic runemagick circle the end of Msanychta's claws and slowly spiral up his forearms.

Msanychta's forearms are encircled several times by ringlets of fiery violet magick, each consecutive circle rotating in opposite directions.

Large stone arches permit passage onto the four open-air balconies from this center area. A steady breeze flows through from the north, bringing with it the stench of rotting meat and blood. Grey stone dust lies thickly on everything; boxes, walls, and supplies. Dark black stains run across the floorboards in large rivulets. The dust on some of the crates has been recently disturbed.  Some dusty wooden crates and a weathered pine ladder are here.

They scratch themselves in confusion, and you can hear them muttering something about leaving it on its side, so it does not fall again. There will be a resident who is unhappy with their purchase this evening.  A street lantern is here.

A neatly trimmed hedge with a small strip of grass fronts the road that travels between the Spurian Housing District and the center of town. A well dressed Frontacian woman hurries along the path as two immaculately dressed Guards lead a criminal towards the jail. She sniffs in a haughty manner, and tips her hat down so she does not have to view the filth of the city.  A street lantern is here.

A polished wooden bench sits in front of a neatly trimmed hedge. It is the perfect spot for those who wish to rest and allow their pets or children to play along the grass fronting the roadway. A small stone well complete with a dipper stands ready to slake the thirst of those who travel this way or who need a breather.  A small stone well and a street lantern are here.

The road between the center of town and the housing district is well kept and maintained. Ruts are immediately repaired and small bushes and flowers line the way. The class of people that travel this way are better dressed and obviously of a higher class. Occasionally guards can be seen taking criminals towards the jail in an efficient and orderly manner.

The elegant Hotel Royale towers above the street, its emerald door sparkling in the light. The patrons that stroll in and out are catered to, doors opened and closed for them, and baggage and packages carried by harried servants. The large Bank of Spur sits on the east side of the square. Its location close to the Royale is not a coincidence. A gold-trimmed door is proof of the success of this branch of the Spurian bank and those who run it.  An elegant gold-trimmed walnut door, an open emerald steel door, a street lantern, and a new rosewood sign pointing southeast are here.

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.  A flowing white marble fountain, a marble statue of a Human, a shimmering marble statue of a Dragon, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a rosewood sign, a crisp gold lettered vellum notice, a broken star shaped bone shield, and an open dented gold coffer are here.

Many people crowd the narrow Bazaar Path, either heading towards the infamous Bazaar, or forcing their way back towards Trade Way. For a small price, a farmer can rent a booth and directly market his goods. Both some of the best and some of the worst deals can be made within this collection of stalls. The tall wall of Spur looms high to the east, and many of the guards take an early peek into the carts and the goods coming to market.  A street lantern is here.

The well-defined Bazaar path heads off to the west. This corner is a mix of the old and the new. On one corner an old stall is barely standing. The roof has caved in, and it quickly becomes apparent that this location has become a local dump. Pieces of wood that look suspiciously like some of the leftovers from other construction sites are piled on top of rotting offal. On the opposite corner a new tent is being erected, its high roof and vivid coloring pleasing to the eye.  An open stall and a street lantern are here.

A crooked wooden sign, a weathered dark wooden stall, and a broken street lantern are here.

An old Thugian pulls and pushes a very stubborn donkey. Neither end seems to be cooperating with his demands.

[Market Street.]

Situated between the well-traveled Trade Way to the north and the fine shops of Market Circle to the south, this small stretch of road is busy at all times of day. Adventurers with sacks of plundered goods leave Market Street and head west where a shrewd businessman has set up shop in this busy area of the Market District. A small shop stands slightly to the east of the arch leading into Merchant Circle, light shining through its red glass door and illuminating the store front in a cheerful, ruby glow.  A street lantern, an opaque ruby red glass door, and a gold lettered wooden sign are here.

[Market Street.]

Situated between the well-traveled Trade Way to the north and the fine shops of Market Circle to the south, this small stretch of road is busy at all times of day. Adventurers with sacks of plundered goods leave Market Street and head west where a shrewd businessman has set up shop in this busy area of the Market District. A small shop stands slightly to the east of the arch leading into Merchant Circle, light shining through its red glass door and illuminating the store front in a cheerful, ruby glow.  A street lantern, an opaque ruby red glass door, and a gold lettered wooden sign are here.

[Market Circle.]

An arch between two large buildings connects Market Circle and Market Street. The more reputable shopkeepers do business within the circle, but pay higher taxes for the privilege. The buildings have been built to last, as these merchants are no traveling tinkers. Interlocking stone walkways and colorful plantings span this central area. Despite the number of animals waiting outside the bank for their owners, the area is spotless. Loud chatter in many languages can be heard from the southwest.  A marble archway, an open elegant gold-trimmed walnut door, and a wooden sign are here.

[Market Circle.]

An arch between two large buildings connects Market Circle and Market Street. The more reputable shopkeepers do business within the circle, but pay higher taxes for the privilege. The buildings have been built to last, as these merchants are no traveling tinkers. Interlocking stone walkways and colorful plantings span this central area. Despite the number of animals waiting outside the bank for their owners, the area is spotless. Loud chatter in many languages can be heard from the southwest.  A marble archway, an open elegant gold-trimmed walnut door, and a wooden sign are here.

Situated between the well-traveled Trade Way to the north and the fine shops of Market Circle to the south, this small stretch of road is busy at all times of day. Adventurers with sacks of plundered goods leave Market Street and head west where a shrewd businessman has set up shop in this busy area of the Market District. A small shop stands slightly to the east of the arch leading into Merchant Circle, light shining through its red glass door and illuminating the store front in a cheerful, ruby glow.  A street lantern, an opaque ruby red glass door, and a gold lettered wooden sign are here.

A human couple exit the building, arm in arm. A small sign stands beside the intersection.  A sign, an open glossy lacquered oak door, and a street lantern are here.

The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.

Atop the fountain is an intricately carved Secian who appears to be dancing with the water as it splashes around her. Set in the marble base is a small plaque that reads, "For those who have gone before us." Many stand for a moment as they pass this way, giving thanks for the gift of life that is given by both the apple tree and the Secians of long ago. Large piles of dirt and broken stone lay on either side of the street as workmen ready the east and west alleys for expansion.

A large mansion looms up before you. Immense oak double doors are carved with fine detail, depicting the rather intimidating countenances of a wolf and a lion. Two obsidian sconces reside on either side of the doors, yet they are in excellent condition, as if they have never even been lit. A rather large expanse of grass is bisected by two paths, one leading to the household, and one to the east towards a large copse of of trees.  Some closed intricately carved oak double doors and an open engraved black steel gate are here.

A small worn path leads its way through a rather dark copse of trees. Twisted branches form a barrier to bar any light that might filter down from the sky. Leaves crunch beneath your feet breaking the eerie silence. No creatures make a sound, a strange occurrence for such a verdant piece of land.

Two small stone cottages sit side by side.  The two cottages were built with high, narrow windows and thick stone walls.  Black doors have been set deep within the thick stone walls.  A closed shadowy black stone door and a closed shadowy black stone door are here.

go gate
>[Side street.]

Numerous guards, some stationary at their posts, some patrolling the endless hedgerows, display the vast wealth and power behind the few widely spaced gates along this road. It is clear from the road the guards are all heavily armed and armored with only the best equipment. It would be safe to assume they are quite experienced and highly trained as well.  A street lantern and an open engraved black steel gate are here.

>[Side street.]

The street ends abruptly at a shadowed gateway. The walls adjoining the gate have started to crumble due to the stress put on them by neglect and time. However, they do manage to conceal the looming estate within. The gate itself, though still functional, has fallen into a state of disrepair. The air is different, stale, and a certain coldness seems to linger upon the sudden wind, regardless of the weather. It must be the wind making that mournful moaning sound.  A wooden sign, an open black iron gate, and a street lantern are here.

go gate
>[Overgrown walkway.]

Tall weeds and brush almost obscure a small walkway that leads to what was once a magnificent home. In need of desperate repair this multistoried mansion has seen better days. Damaged woodwork, peeling paint, and broken windows mar what may have once been a beautiful facade. Rending the air with a shrill squeak, a rusted iron gate swings back and forth in the wind hanging precariously from its hinges.  An open rusted iron gate is here.

Creaking steps lead onto a porch that wraps around the width of the house. Magnificent oak doors, that bear the emblem of a flaming lion on it, allow entrance into this dilapidated home. On closer inspection, the initials "S.E." have been carved into the grainy oak.  An open oak door is here.

[Entryway.]

The smell of rotting wood is strong in the entryway of the house. Your movements have caused some of the dust to rise. As it settles, you notice other older looking footprints that cross over each other time and time again. Two suits of armor with crossed halberds guard an archway to the east. The arch itself has the flaming lion engraved into it.  An open oak door, an open wooden door, an open mahogany door, an archway, and a stairs are here.

This room is illuminated.

go ar
>[Long dark hallway.]

Looking to the west, you feel your feet become rooted to the floor. Is it just you or did the halberds held by those empty suits of armor move? Glancing around nervously, you look for an exit in this poorly lit hallway, and hope that it is not in the direction of the armor.

This end of the hallway is colder and darker than the western end; even lighting more torches would not improve this condition. A soft melody drifts through the second doorway. Perhaps you should see who or what is playing such a lovely tune.  An open black door and an open black door are here.

Bowing as you enter, a skeleton in a tuxedo takes your coat and waves you over to a podium where a feather quill rises in the air and scribes your name in a gold-leafed book.

Before you stands a magnificent staircase descending into a spacious ballroom which is alive with activity and sound. A short zombie in a fine suit announces your arrival and silence settles over the crowd as all heads turn towards you.

The pounding grows louder and seems to come from the top of a rickety stairway that winds around a dark tower. A sudden gust of wind tries to rip your clothes from your body. Perhaps the ballroom was not such a bad place to be after all.  Some white marble benches, a flaming torch, and some fire blackened stairs are here.

Dark liquid drips down the walls of this hallway, leaving rusty colored streaks on the torn, once elegant wallpaper. Oddly, the liquid seems to vanish before reaching the floor, as there do not appear to be any pools of it. A chilled breeze whisks through, bringing with it a fetid smell. There is a persistent scratching noise coming from somewhere ahead. There is a door in the eastern wall.

One rack of books sits against the wall, protected from the ravages of time by a faintly glowing magickal barrier. Torn pages and mangled books are scattered everywhere, the broken remains of shelves showing deep scars from powerful claws. Piles of ash mark the spots where some books were burned, the knowledge contained in them perhaps lost forever.   A short wickedly pointed brass ice pick and some silver coins are here.

As it settles, you notice other older looking footprints that cross over each other time and time again. Two suits of armor with crossed halberds guard an archway to the east. The arch itself has the flaming lion engraved into it.  An open oak door, an open wooden door, an open mahogany door, an archway, and a stairs are here.

Tall weeds and brush almost obscure a small walkway that leads to what was once a magnificent home. In need of desperate repair this multistoried mansion has seen better days. Damaged woodwork, peeling paint, and broken windows mar what may have once been a beautiful facade. Rending the air with a shrill squeak, a rusted iron gate swings back and forth in the wind hanging precariously from its hinges.  An open rusted iron gate is here.

The street ends abruptly at a shadowed gateway. The walls adjoining the gate have started to crumble due to the stress put on them by neglect and time. However, they do manage to conceal the looming estate within. The gate itself, though still functional, has fallen into a state of disrepair. The air is different, stale, and a certain coldness seems to linger upon the sudden wind, regardless of the weather. It must be the wind making that mournful moaning sound.  A wooden sign, an open black iron gate, and a street lantern are here.

Perfectly trimmed mature elms line this street, towering over your head and sheltering the meticulously kept cobble roadway. An impressively massive private estate crouches imposingly from beyond a well-guarded gateway on the north side. A few well-dressed gardeners can be glimpsed through the vine-bedecked gate. Not surprisingly, even the groundskeepers are stylish in their matching uniforms.  An open iron gate and a street lantern are here.

The avenue comes to a fork, with Noble Way curving from south to the northwest. A side-street heading off to the east leads to an extremely well kept neighborhood that easily surpasses everything around it in splendor and magnificence.

Leaving the exceptionally wealthy estates of the Spurian nobility, Noble Way heads toward the Town Square to the northwest. Along the roadside can be seen the in-city homes of successful merchants and other wealthy citizens of the Spur. The homes display a slightly different style, perhaps they are not quite so restrained; a touch more exuberance and freedom with materials is displayed.  A street lantern is here.

Gazing down each of the nearby private drives reveals a glimpse of a luxurious home, each a miniature estate in its own right. Short, stout walls and manicured hedges serve to keep out the riffraff and to protect the small, expensive gardens.

Noble Way continues to wind its way among the rather modestly sized, but elegant, homes of the Spur's successful. Many a peasant farmer may live in homes larger than these, but none can match the quality found here. A peaceful, luxurious feeling pervades this part of town; perhaps it is the drifting floral scents wafting from the well-tended gardens.

Set in the marble base is a small plaque that reads, "For those who have gone before us." Many stand for a moment as they pass this way, giving thanks for the gift of life that is given by both the apple tree and the Secians of long ago. Large piles of dirt and broken stone lay on either side of the street as workmen ready the east and west alleys for expansion.

Standing next to a very empty lantern pole, a small Flerian child insists in a plaintive wail, that he had nothing to do with the missing lantern. The well-dressed guard that interrogates him keeps pointing at a small sack on the ground and its obvious contents.  An open small burlap sack, a street lantern, and a lantern are here.

The boughs of a large apple tree hang over the well tended avenue. Below the beautiful tree stands a small fountain. Atop the fountain is an intricately carved Secian who appears to be dancing with the water as it splashes around her. Set in the marble base is a small plaque that reads, "For those who have gone before us." Many stand for a moment as they pass this way, giving thanks for the gift of life that is given by both the apple tree and the Secians of long ago. Large piles of dirt and broken stone lay on either side of the street as workmen ready the east and west alleys for expansion.

Struggling through the underbrush, you make your way down the small trail only to be brought up short by an impenetrable wall of brambles. Plump red berries hang from the small branches of the bushes, guarded by long, sharp thorns. On a low hanging branch overhead, a watchful owl stares at you with golden eyes.  A slightly hidden trail, an ethereal looking owl, some fragrant red rose petals, and a large tangleroot thicket are here.

The path disappears yet again in the tangled undergrowth. The thicket surrounding you is a hindrance in scouting out any sign of the path.

Winding through the trees, the path emerges from the dense foliage and continues northward. You begin to wonder if there is a way into the seemingly impenetrable western forest. A track, that looks to be one used by small animals, veers off to the side.  A leaf covered iron snare, some tangleroot skin, and some tangleroot skin are here.

The footbridge that once connected this path to its match on the other side of the overflowing rushing river is now nothing more then a few charred pilings. Tiny insects buzz around their remains, finding a comfortable new home. Lashed to the remains of one of the more sturdy pilings is a tall steel pole. Wrapped around the pole, and tied securely is a taut rope. Bobbing ever so lightly due to the strain of the riverboat, the rope holds tight.  A flowing river, a freshly painted sign, some carved oak benches, and some tangleroot skin are here.

The path continues to the west through a mix of moss covered Fir and Alder trees. Further to the west, taller trees designate the incline of a hill. All around the trunks of the taller trees, a large patch of glossy leafed ivy spreads over the burned remains of the old city.  Several charred planks lay in piles under the proliferous ivy as nature's cycle of renewal chews, burrows, disintegrates and mulches the wood back to the soil.  Some mossy Fir trees and some majestic ivy covered Alder trees are here.

A matched pair of dapple grays stand in front of the shack waiting to take their human baggage to their destination. To the left of the door, behind a small paned window, a beautiful Fir Elf female takes coin and in return, with a charming smile, directs those who have paid their fare into the waiting room.

Carefully winding its way up the base of the tree, and wrapping itself around the stairs, a flowering jasmine vine grows tall and lush. Dark scars from a past fire are almost hidden under tufts of fresh growth and moss. A large gap, nearly sixteen feet in distance, rests between the base of a set of stairs and the forest floor. A long moonsilver cord hangs down the side of the tree. If one pulls it, the long Elven rope will descend from above, allowing them to enter the great city of Treehaven. Bright green leaves of clover have begun springing up through the ashy soil in conjunction with soft moss to lend a durable cushion to this well-traveled spot.  Some vine-covered steps circling the tree, a freshly painted wooden sign, a healthy green patch of clover, a flowing marble fountain, some clover shaped stones, some sweet scented flowering jasmine vines, and a long woven moonsilver cord are here.

Four sturdy walls and a roof of woven branches enclose this small tavern. From the forest floor, winding their way around the trunk of the Mother Tree, a set of intricately railed steps serve as the entrance and exit of the town of Treehaven. Strangers arriving at the top of the steps find themselves under the watchful eye of patrons seated at tables positioned about the light, airy room. A set of oak steps lead up to the new Council chambers.  An ivory inlaid pine bar, a wooden stool, a long weathered wooden bench, a long musty wooden table, some steps circling the tree, some freshly crafted oak steps, an open door, a paper covered posting board, a gilt framed painting on the wall, and an open large straw basket are here.

The branches of this tree have begun to grow through the wooden platform. The limbs have begun to twist and turn, forming their own natural base. Soft leaves create a cushion and boast several small buds. The empty remains of an abandoned building is just barely visible between the branches, buried in vines and moss.

Firm wooden planks fit snuggly to create the walkway that extends proudly upon the reconstructed supports. The view of the forest to the northwest is quite panoramic. A staircase here seems to have some enchantment, judging by the strange appearance of unicorns, bears and owls on the lower steps. Strange, due to the fact that they don't appear carved, painted, or placed by any hand-made means. It is as if the glyphs grew into the wood itself. Mysterious symbols are scattered throughout the portraits, which shimmer with a golden whisper as they are approached.

A large tapestry lines the outside wall of the passageway, most impressive in that it is not made of fabric, but of vines as tiny as thick hairs, growing in a weave. The delicate shadings of the plants is perfectly natural, and as the eye becomes unfocused, a picture of a diminutive, beautiful maiden sits amongst a foresty background. The wall opposite of this magnificent tapestry is lined with portraits of prominent temple leaders, the colors vibrant, bringing a life-like sense to the frames. The eyes of the maiden in the tapestry seem to follow you, staring directly as you pass, boring into your soul.

While the tree appears gigantic from the outside, it still is nothing compared to the impression of being on the inside. Hollow branches large enough to pass a drake branch out here, the surfaces smooth, but in a most curious way. It is apparent that no tools were used to create these passageways, yet there is no evidence to give one the impression that the passageways formed over a long period of time. The branches have grown in this manner intentionally, quite unlike any plantlife found anywhere on the land.

The glory of Elindale can be found, scribed into these pages, as well as other points of interest. Historical novels, books of lore and tomes of knowledge are available for the temple registry to peruse. Any time spent here could prove to teach anyone something they haven't yet learned, or at the very least, one might study the tomes to learn better how to do that which they already know.
