[Emjedah Star, Enchanter's Crossroad.]

An exquisite crystal inlaid black marble fountain rests in the center of Emjedah's heart. Its grand structure rises upward toward the sky like a flame as streams of water swirl like moonsilver down the fountain's sinuous curves. Along the base of the fountain, crystallized inscriptions of ancient runes glow as gushes of water spiral and dance in the fountain's small pool. Black marble flower beds of crimson roses outline the beginnings of cobblestone avenues, forming a star of passageways that will lead in every direction through the city.  Some fragrant crimson roses, some filigree crafted iron benches, a glowing rune inscribed cobblestone walkway, and a rune covered marble archway are here.

This area is illuminated.
