[Hope's Path.]

The path of four leaf clove shaped flagstones leads past a small clean shack and into a well formed tunnel through the thorn bushes to the east and the Caersech to the west. The small shack is set back from the road, its walls built of a whitewashed birch. A sturdy corral, filled with well-fed horses, stands to the left of the shack. A matched pair of dapple grays stand in front of the shack waiting to take their human baggage to their destination. To the left of the door, behind a small paned window, a beautiful Fir Elf female takes coin and in return, with a charming smile, directs those who have paid their fare into the waiting room.  A small shack, a freshly painted sign, a notice of non-refund, and a small winding stone pathway are here.

A small path, its stones in the shape of four leaf clovers, winds its way through the sparse remains of a once dense undergrowth. New plants and flowers begin to rise from the blackened floor, bringing a new color and life to the area.  A small winding stone pathway and a mossy cracked steelwood tree are here.

A fine haze of dust hovers over the remains of the Silver Owl Inn. Through the fallen timbers and memories of lives lost, one can see brilliant green sprouts reaching for sunlight. A tiny songbird perches on an old stick of furniture poking through the rubble, singing sweetly to herald new life and hope. A small winding path of stones placed in the shape of four leaf clovers winds itself through the forest.  A small winding stone pathway and a charred flowering steelwood tree are here.

Once dead and blackened trees now come to life with spots of moss and growth. A patch of wild mushrooms grows at the base of one of the trees. Small, four-leaf-clover shaped stones, form a small path through the area. The soft sound of running water echoes in from the west.

A small stream runs noisily under the two bridges spanning the ravine. A number of the brunt oaks still stand about, memorials to the forest this once was. A number of small saplings dot the ground between the black trunks. Between the stream bank and oaks, a small path of four-leaf-clover shaped stones weave a windy path through the forest.  A stone bridge, a wooden bridge, a clump of wildgrass, and some flowering jasmine vines are here.

An ancient oak tree towers above the forest floor, covering the surrounding landscape beneath its branches. The natural buzz of the recovering forest is barely audible above the rush of the rapidly moving river. Small grasses and wildflowers poke through the leaf-covered ground.  An oak tree and a broken and cracked steelwood tree are here.

Emerging from the dark grove, the trail ends abruptly. The stream tumbles over a sheer cliff and into the ravine below as it sweeps through from the northeast, its waters raging against the chasm walls. Dark shadows from the forest and cave below have begun to expand and swarm the area.

A narrow strip of mud separates the cliff face from the churning waters at the bottom of the falls. A misty spray soaks this path that terminates at a deep blue pool to the south. Continuing north, the path disappears into a muddy bog.  A rotting hemp rope and a muddy path to the bog are here.

A bog spreads out to the north and east, sheltered by the high walls of a ravine. The western edge of the bog melts into a deep lake fed by a rushing waterfall. Beside the path, an ancient snapping turtle rises to the surface of a stagnant muddy pool. After a brief breath of air, he disappears into the murky depths.  A path to the waterfall is here.

Leafy tree branches hang so low that they rest on the surface of the scummy water. Brightly colored dragonflies dart between them, their glistening bodies a welcome change to the brown, murky bog.

Long tendrils of dark green moss drape from hanging branches. The curtain of ancient cypress obscures the view deeper into the bog. Brushing them aside only reveals more cypress and stringy moss.

A rotting log, home to several winged insects, spans a large pool of murky water that lies between the limestone walls of the ravine. It looks stable enough to support a significant amount of weight, and judging by the air bubbles that rise to the surface of the murky water at regular intervals, it is probably best to keep ones extremities above the water level in this boggy marsh.  A long rotting log is here.

A rotting log, home to several winged insects, spans a large pool of murky water that lies between the limestone walls of the ravine. It looks stable enough to support a significant amount of weight, and judging by the air bubbles that rise to the surface of the murky water at regular intervals, it is probably best to keep ones extremities above the water level in this boggy marsh.

As the elevation drops to the west, this muddy bog gives way to a large lake. Clear paths are visible along the walls of the ravine to both the southwest and northwest, venturing to the center of the bog will require careful foot placement to avoid the stagnant pools and deep muck. Walking through the dark waters that pools atop the sludge beneath can prove dangerous for even the most sure-footed hunter.

[Muddy Bog.]

A rocky path skirts the base of a sheer limestone cliff. Despite the unstable footing on the loose stone, this path is far quicker than slogging through the dangerous bog. Tiny pebbles click against the trail as they lose their place in the rock wall, leaving small niches in the jagged surface. To the northwest, the size of the fallen rocks is noticeably larger.

This area is illuminated.
In the area are Orianna the Noble Anthian (flying 20 feet above ground), Ariella the Anthian (flying 20 feet above ground), Kambralyn the Noble Fir Elf, Kithrael the Fir Elf, and Clive the Noble Drag-al.

[Muddy Bog.]

The rock strewn path gives way to cool, spongy earth as one heads into the bog. Tiny insects with paddle-shaped appendages dance across the surface of some standing water as tall grasses sway to and fro with the breeze. Deep in the bog, a piercing cry is quickly silenced as some unfortunate animal meets its fate by either being swallowed up in the muck or being attacked by the bog's more ferocious creatures.

Several painted arrow shafts stick up out of the path at crazy angles, suggesting some kind of crude hunter's marker.  Why anyone would want to mark a path through the edge of the bog is anyone's guess. The leafy shoot of an oak tree has a pitiful hold in the ground with its roots almost completely exposed.  A family of beetles has taken residence under its branches and made a hearty meal from the lower leaves.  Some broken blackened acorns are here.

To the west, the brilliantly clear waters of the lake glitter with schools of leaping silverback fish. The view is a startling contrast to the ominously dark waters that make up the home for the bog's denizens.

A subtle under-current pulls the standing reeds to lean slightly south with their leaves trailing down into the water. A large rock lizard flicks its tongue into the air as it scuttles up onto a large rock in pursuit of its dinner. Parts of the rock seem to move as the lizard abruptly vanishes into its depths.

The view east seems darker still as the bog waters deepen into blackness.

Thick, slimy bubbles emerge to the surface of the deep bog and burst with a sickening sound that startles the prey of a nearby snake into hopping away at the last second. Low-hanging cypress branches shade the already dark waters, making them appear much more sinister than the surrounding bog. Somehow life still must go on here,as the splashing of fish diving beneath the exposed roots of the trees can still be heard.

A rotting log, home to several winged insects, spans a large pool of murky water that lies between the limestone walls of the ravine. It looks stable enough to support a significant amount of weight, and judging by the air bubbles that rise to the surface of the murky water at regular intervals, it is probably best to keep ones extremities above the water level in this boggy marsh.  A long rotting log is here.

The murky waters of the bog deepen here, and continue to do so to the east, making any movement on foot a sluggish task. Scraggly moss dangles from low hanging cypress trees, providing as yet another obstacle to overcome within the murk. Insects chirp and trill from every angle, almost disguising the low baying of a strange animal nearby; a threat or a warning?  Some stooped cypress trees and some low hanging moss are here.

The rock strewn path gives way to cool, spongy earth as one heads into the bog. Tiny insects with paddle-shaped appendages dance across the surface of some standing water as tall grasses sway to and fro with the breeze.

[Muddy Bog.]

A furry, raccoon-like animal scrambles to free his back legs from the mud and get back into the cleaner fishing waters.  A lizard drowsing on some nearby rocks watches the animal's movements intensely, twitching its tail. The path that snakes around the the east is hard to make out, making it easy to wander toward the deeper waters if one is not careful.

[Muddy Bog.]

To the west, the brilliantly clear waters of the lake glitter with schools of leaping silverback fish. The view is a startling contrast to the ominously dark waters that make up the home for the bog's denizens. Even the bird nesting in nearby cypress trees seem depressed when they lean their heads down to clean the mud off their feet. The view east seems darker still as the bog waters deepen into blackness.

The rock strewn path gives way to cool, spongy earth as one heads into the bog. Tiny insects with paddle-shaped appendages dance across the surface of some standing water as tall grasses sway to and fro with the breeze. Deep in the bog, a piercing cry is quickly silenced as some unfortunate animal meets its fate by either being swallowed up in the muck or being attacked by the bog's more ferocious creatures.

Long tendrils of dark green moss drape from hanging branches. The curtain of ancient cypress obscures the view deeper into the bog. Brushing them aside only reveals more cypress and stringy moss. Strange birds call to each other from deep within the trees, but the most that can be seen are a few ruddy feathers.

The footing is more stable beside the walls of the chasm, though the risk of falling rock is greater. A rusting sword blade peeks out from beneath one side of a particularly large boulder, a rotting leather boot is partially visible beneath the other side. Even an Oog-ra could determine what happened to this poor soul.  A giant limestone boulder is here.

[Muddy Bog.]

Thick, slimy bubbles emerge to the surface of the deep bog and burst with a sickening sound that startles the prey of a nearby snake into hopping away at the last second. Low-hanging cypress branches shade the already dark waters, making them appear much more sinister than the surrounding bog. Somehow life still must go on here,as the splashing of fish diving beneath the exposed roots of the trees can still be heard.

[Muddy Bog.]

Muddy footprints lead from the deeper waters of the bog up toward the edge of the muck.  Oddly enough, there are no footprints coming the other way, as if some large creature crawled out of the sludge to shore. Tiny winged insects buzz all around you, creating eerie harmonies with their wings. Cypress leaves are scattered all throughout the area, with some floating lazily in the waters and others stuck comically atop mounds of mud.  A tomato stained chef's apron is here.

The rock strewn path gives way to cool, spongy earth as one heads into the bog. Tiny insects with paddle-shaped appendages dance across the surface of some standing water as tall grasses sway to and fro with the breeze.

As the sounds of the waterfall echo from the southeast, the waters of the lake glimmer in the available light, and the boggy air lightens up considerably. Across the lake to the north and west, the dense green forest rises, and the hoots and calls of various forest creatures becomes faintly apparent against the soothing background noise of the running water.

Travel through the deep-bog is rather difficult at this section as the thick, sludgy water is as high as a human's waist. Some fallen, rotting logs jut up from underneath, providing needed handholds. Glittering yellow eyes sparkle for a brief moment in a low branch of the cypress trees.  A twisted mossy oak tree stump, a small radiant agate figurine, and an open baggy leather sack are here.

To the west, the brilliantly clear waters of the lake glitter with schools of leaping silverback fish. The view is a startling contrast to the ominously dark waters that make up the home for the bog's denizens. Even the bird nesting in nearby cypress trees seem depressed when they lean their heads down to clean the mud off their feet. The view east seems darker still as the bog waters deepen into blackness.

[Muddy Bog.]

A subtle under-current pulls the standing reeds to lean slightly south with their leaves trailing down into the water. A large rock lizard flicks its tongue into the air as it scuttles up onto a large rock in pursuit of its dinner. Parts of the rock seem to move as the lizard abruptly vanishes into its depths. After a brief silence following a large gulping sound, the cacaphony of insects returns to its normal volume.

[Muddy Bog.]

The bog is less murky at this juncture, with the cleaner waters of the lake cleansing the mud beneath.  Even some silverback fishes feed near some floating logs, their backs arching grafully as they leap out as the baby dragonflies that buzz overhead. The vegetation that covers the logs are noticeably healthier than the scraggly trees that inhabit the rest of the bog.  Some rotting mossy sprout-covered logs are here.

[Muddy Bog.]

To the west, the brilliantly clear waters of the lake glitter with schools of leaping silverback fish. The view is a startling contrast to the ominously dark waters that make up the home for the bog's denizens. Even the bird nesting in nearby cypress trees seem depressed when they lean their heads down to clean the mud off their feet. The view east seems darker still as the bog waters deepen into blackness.  A pair of dark brown orkskin gloves are here.

[Muddy Bog.]

Muddy footprints lead from the deeper waters of the bog up toward the edge of the muck.  Oddly enough, there are no footprints coming the other way, as if some large creature crawled out of the sludge to shore. Tiny winged insects buzz all around you, creating eerie harmonies with their wings. Cypress leaves are scattered all throughout the area, with some floating lazily in the waters and others stuck comically atop mounds of mud.  A tomato stained chef's apron and an open stained lionskin sack are here.

Thick, slimy bubbles emerge to the surface of the deep bog and burst with a sickening sound that startles the prey of a nearby snake into hopping away at the last second. Low-hanging cypress branches shade the already dark waters, making them appear much more sinister than the surrounding bog. Somehow life still must go on here,as the splashing of fish diving beneath the exposed roots of the trees can still be heard.

A rotting log, home to several winged insects, spans a large pool of murky water that lies between the limestone walls of the ravine. It looks stable enough to support a significant amount of weight, and judging by the air bubbles that rise to the surface of the murky water at regular intervals, it is probably best to keep ones extremities above the water level in this boggy marsh.

Thick, slimy bubbles emerge to the surface of the deep bog and burst with a sickening sound that startles the prey of a nearby snake into hopping away at the last second. Low-hanging cypress branches shade the already dark waters, making them appear much more sinister than the surrounding bog. Somehow life still must go on here,as the splashing of fish diving beneath the exposed roots of the trees can still be heard.  An open gold-trimmed bearskin sack and a leather covered steelwood targe are here.

A rotting log, home to several winged insects, spans a large pool of murky water that lies between the limestone walls of the ravine.

[Muddy Bog.]

As the elevation drops to the west, this muddy bog gives way to a large lake. Clear paths are visible along the walls of the ravine to both the southwest and northwest, venturing to the center of the bog will require careful foot placement to avoid the stagnant pools and deep muck. Walking through the dark waters that pools atop the sludge beneath can prove dangerous for even the most sure-footed hunter.

[Muddy Bog.]

A rocky path skirts the base of a sheer limestone cliff. Despite the unstable footing on the loose stone, this path is far quicker than slogging through the dangerous bog. Tiny pebbles click against the trail as they lose their place in the rock wall, leaving small niches in the jagged surface. To the northwest, the size of the fallen rocks is noticeably larger.

Long tendrils of dark green moss drape from hanging branches. The curtain of ancient cypress obscures the view deeper into the bog. Brushing them aside only reveals more cypress and stringy moss. Strange birds call to each other from deep within the trees, but the most that can be seen are a few ruddy feathers.

Muddy footprints lead from the deeper waters of the bog up toward the edge of the muck.  Oddly enough, there are no footprints coming the other way, as if some large creature crawled out of the sludge to shore. Tiny winged insects buzz all around you, creating eerie harmonies with their wings. Cypress leaves are scattered all throughout the area, with some floating lazily in the waters and others stuck comically atop mounds of mud.

The rock strewn path gives way to cool, spongy earth as one heads into the bog. Tiny insects with paddle-shaped appendages dance across the surface of some standing water as tall grasses sway to and fro with the breeze. Deep in the bog, a piercing cry is quickly silenced as some unfortunate animal meets its fate by either being swallowed up in the muck or being attacked by the bog's more ferocious creatures.

A well worn path clings to the base of the ravine wall, the riot of reeds and rushes threatening to claim it. Recently laid deer tracks come to an abrupt end at a site of obvious struggle. The bent stalks of marsh grasses indicate the direction the unlucky animal was dragged, with bits of bloody fur littering its path. On the ravine wall, some jokester has written in fading chalk, "No swimming allowed."

As the elevation drops to the west, this muddy bog gives way to a large lake.

A rocky path skirts the base of a sheer limestone cliff. Despite the unstable footing on the loose stone, this path is far quicker than slogging through the dangerous bog. Tiny pebbles click against the trail as they lose their place in the rock wall, leaving small niches in the jagged surface. To the northwest, the size of the fallen rocks is noticeably larger.  Some silver coins are here.

[Muddy Bog.]

A well worn path clings to the base of the ravine wall, the riot of reeds and rushes threatening to claim it. Recently laid deer tracks come to an abrupt end at a site of obvious struggle. The bent stalks of marsh grasses indicate the direction the unlucky animal was dragged, with bits of bloody fur littering its path. On the ravine wall, some jokester has written in fading chalk, "No swimming allowed."

The footing is more stable beside the walls of the chasm, though the risk of falling rock is greater. A rusting sword blade peeks out from beneath one side of a particularly large boulder, a rotting leather boot is partially visible beneath the other side. Even an Oog-ra could determine what happened to this poor soul.  A giant limestone boulder is here.

Leafy tree branches hang so low that they rest on the surface of the scummy water. Brightly colored dragonflies dart between them, their glistening bodies a welcome change to the brown, murky bog. The clearer water of the lake drifts in from the west, keeping the bog moist all year round.

A bog spreads out to the north and east, sheltered by the high walls of a ravine. The western edge of the bog melts into a deep lake fed by a rushing waterfall. Beside the path, an ancient snapping turtle rises to the surface of a stagnant muddy pool. After a brief breath of air, he disappears into the murky depths.  A path to the waterfall is here.

The narrow muddy path ends at the edge of a deep blue pool. Overhead, the waters of the forest stream gush out into the frothing river. A gentler cascade trickles down the rock face of the chasm, creating a double waterfall. The hardened mud to one side of the path holds the impressions and footsteps of a struggle that occurred here, and a few scattered scales that were dislodged during the battle are becoming petrified into the surroundings by the deposits from the mist of the double waterfall. A rock shelf rests a few feet above the pool, housing an inviting combination of moss and clover.  A beautiful flowing waterfall, a deep blue pool, and a soft mossy patch of clover are here.

A fine haze of dust hovers over the remains of the Silver Owl Inn. Through the fallen timbers and memories of lives lost, one can see brilliant green sprouts reaching for sunlight. A tiny songbird perches on an old stick of furniture poking through the rubble, singing sweetly to herald new life and hope. A small winding path of stones placed in the shape of four leaf clovers winds itself through the forest.  A small winding stone pathway and a charred flowering steelwood tree are here.

The path of four leaf clove shaped flagstones leads past a small clean shack and into a well formed tunnel through the thorn bushes to the east and the Caersech to the west. The small shack is set back from the road, its walls built of a whitewashed birch. A sturdy corral, filled with well-fed horses, stands to the left of the shack. A matched pair of dapple grays stand in front of the shack waiting to take their human baggage to their destination. To the left of the door, behind a small paned window, a beautiful Fir Elf female takes coin and in return, with a charming smile, directs those who have paid their fare into the waiting room.  A small shack, a freshly painted sign, a notice of non-refund, and a small winding stone pathway are here.

Carefully winding its way up the base of the tree, and wrapping itself around the stairs, a flowering jasmine vine grows tall and lush. Dark scars from a past fire are almost hidden under tufts of fresh growth and moss. A large gap, nearly sixteen feet in distance, rests between the base of a set of stairs and the forest floor. A long moonsilver cord hangs down the side of the tree. If one pulls it, the long Elven rope will descend from above, allowing them to enter the great city of Treehaven. Bright green leaves of clover have begun springing up through the ashy soil in conjunction with soft moss to lend a durable cushion to this well-traveled spot.  Some vine-covered steps circling the tree, a freshly painted wooden sign, a healthy green patch of clover, a flowing marble fountain, some clover shaped stones, some sweet scented flowering jasmine vines, and a long woven moonsilver cord are here.

The latticework surrounding and covering the spiral staircase is finely crafted. The intertwining beams seem to weave a delicate pattern above you, accenting the view of the forest floor. Soft, new, growth can be seen all over the forest below. A small mound of moss has slowly begun to cover the old inn, creating a fuzzy green mound. A large pile of Elven rope sits near the silent Golem. This creature of Elindale helps defend the city by retrieving the rope that people have pushed down to the forest below.  Some steps circling the tree and a freshly carved wooden sign are here.

Four sturdy walls and a roof of woven branches enclose this small tavern. From the forest floor, winding their way around the trunk of the Mother Tree, a set of intricately railed steps serve as the entrance and exit of the town of Treehaven. Strangers arriving at the top of the steps find themselves under the watchful eye of patrons seated at tables positioned about the light, airy room. A set of oak steps lead up to the new Council chambers.  An ivory inlaid pine bar, a wooden stool, a long weathered wooden bench, a long musty wooden table, some steps circling the tree, some freshly crafted oak steps, an open door, a paper covered posting board, a gilt framed painting on the wall, and an open large straw basket are here.

Firm wooden planks fit snuggly to create the walkway that extends proudly upon the reconstructed supports. The view of the forest to the northwest is quite panoramic. A staircase here seems to have some enchantment, judging by the strange appearance of unicorns, bears and owls on the lower steps. Strange, due to the fact that they don't appear carved, painted, or placed by any hand-made means. It is as if the glyphs grew into the wood itself. Mysterious symbols are scattered throughout the portraits, which shimmer with a golden whisper as they are approached.

A large tapestry lines the outside wall of the passageway, most impressive in that it is not made of fabric, but of vines as tiny as thick hairs, growing in a weave. The delicate shadings of the plants is perfectly natural, and as the eye becomes unfocused, a picture of a diminutive, beautiful maiden sits amongst a foresty background. The wall opposite of this magnificent tapestry is lined with portraits of prominent temple leaders, the colors vibrant, bringing a life-like sense to the frames. The eyes of the maiden in the tapestry seem to follow you, staring directly as you pass, boring into your soul.

Hollow branches large enough to pass a drake branch out here, the surfaces smooth, but in a most curious way. It is apparent that no tools were used to create these passageways, yet there is no evidence to give one the impression that the passageways formed over a long period of time. The branches have grown in this manner intentionally, quite unlike any plantlife found anywhere on the land.

An elderly Fir Elf druid stands atop a simple birch platform at the heart of the chamber. Before the druid rests a mysterious crystal device etched with glowing green runes. The children of Elindale kneel before the druid as he implants or renews their holy runes.   A simple birch platform is here.

A large tapestry lines the outside wall of the passageway, most impressive in that it is not made of fabric, but of vines as tiny as thick hairs, growing in a weave. The delicate shadings of the plants is perfectly natural, and as the eye becomes unfocused, a picture of a diminutive, beautiful maiden sits amongst a foresty background. The wall opposite of this magnificent tapestry is lined with portraits of prominent temple leaders, the colors vibrant, bringing a life-like sense to the frames. The eyes of the maiden in the tapestry seem to follow you, staring directly as you pass, boring into your soul.  A vellum portrait, a canvas portrait, a suede portrait, a wooden framed oil painting, some unfinished portraits, and a carefully painted silk screen are here.

Firm wooden planks fit snuggly to create the walkway that extends proudly upon the reconstructed supports. The view of the forest to the northwest is quite panoramic. A staircase here seems to have some enchantment, judging by the strange appearance of unicorns, bears and owls on the lower steps. Strange, due to the fact that they don't appear carved, painted, or placed by any hand-made means. It is as if the glyphs grew into the wood itself. Mysterious symbols are scattered throughout the portraits, which shimmer with a golden whisper as they are approached.

Four sturdy walls and a roof of woven branches enclose this small tavern. From the forest floor, winding their way around the trunk of the Mother Tree, a set of intricately railed steps serve as the entrance and exit of the town of Treehaven. Strangers arriving at the top of the steps find themselves under the watchful eye of patrons seated at tables positioned about the light, airy room. A set of oak steps lead up to the new Council chambers.  An ivory inlaid pine bar, a wooden stool, a long weathered wooden bench, a long musty wooden table, some steps circling the tree, some freshly crafted oak steps, an open door, a paper covered posting board, a gilt framed painting on the wall, and an open large straw basket are here.

The latticework surrounding and covering the spiral staircase is finely crafted. The intertwining beams seem to weave a delicate pattern above you, accenting the view of the forest floor. Soft, new, growth can be seen all over the forest below. A small mound of moss has slowly begun to cover the old inn, creating a fuzzy green mound. A large pile of Elven rope sits near the silent Golem. This creature of Elindale helps defend the city by retrieving the rope that people have pushed down to the forest below.  Some steps circling the tree and a freshly carved wooden sign are here.

Carefully winding its way up the base of the tree, and wrapping itself around the stairs, a flowering jasmine vine grows tall and lush. Dark scars from a past fire are almost hidden under tufts of fresh growth and moss. A large gap, nearly sixteen feet in distance, rests between the base of a set of stairs and the forest floor. A long moonsilver cord hangs down the side of the tree. If one pulls it, the long Elven rope will descend from above, allowing them to enter the great city of Treehaven. Bright green leaves of clover have begun springing up through the ashy soil in conjunction with soft moss to lend a durable cushion to this well-traveled spot.  Some vine-covered steps circling the tree, a freshly painted wooden sign, a healthy green patch of clover, a flowing marble fountain, some clover shaped stones, some sweet scented flowering jasmine vines, and a long woven moonsilver cord are here.

The path of four leaf clove shaped flagstones leads past a small clean shack and into a well formed tunnel through the thorn bushes to the east and the Caersech to the west. The small shack is set back from the road, its walls built of a whitewashed birch. A sturdy corral, filled with well-fed horses, stands to the left of the shack. A matched pair of dapple grays stand in front of the shack waiting to take their human baggage to their destination. To the left of the door, behind a small paned window, a beautiful Fir Elf female takes coin and in return, with a charming smile, directs those who have paid their fare into the waiting room.  A small shack, a freshly painted sign, a notice of non-refund, and a small winding stone pathway are here.

A small winding path of stones placed in the shape of four leaf clovers winds itself through the forest.  A small winding stone pathway and a charred flowering steelwood tree are here.

Once dead and blackened trees now come to life with spots of moss and growth. A patch of wild mushrooms grows at the base of one of the trees. Small, four-leaf-clover shaped stones, form a small path through the area. The soft sound of running water echoes in from the west.

[Hope's Path.]

A small stream runs noisily under the two bridges spanning the ravine. A number of the brunt oaks still stand about, memorials to the forest this once was. A number of small saplings dot the ground between the black trunks. Between the stream bank and oaks, a small path of four-leaf-clover shaped stones weave a windy path through the forest.  A stone bridge, a wooden bridge, a clump of wildgrass, and some flowering jasmine vines are here.

The western bank is steep and rocky. In some places, it has collapsed, exposing the immense roots of the oaks nearest the stream. The stream widens and its waters become deeper. The gentle flow has become a strong current.   A stone bridge is here.

An ancient oak tree towers above the forest floor, covering the surrounding landscape beneath its branches. The natural buzz of the recovering forest is barely audible above the rush of the rapidly moving river. Small grasses and wildflowers poke through the leaf-covered ground.  An oak tree and a broken and cracked steelwood tree are here.

Emerging from the dark grove, the trail ends abruptly. The stream tumbles over a sheer cliff and into the ravine below as it sweeps through from the northeast, its waters raging against the chasm walls. Dark shadows from the forest and cave below have begun to expand and swarm the area.

A narrow strip of mud separates the cliff face from the churning waters at the bottom of the falls. A misty spray soaks this path that terminates at a deep blue pool to the south. Continuing north, the path disappears into a muddy bog.  A rotting hemp rope and a muddy path to the bog are here.

[Muddy Bog.]

A bog spreads out to the north and east, sheltered by the high walls of a ravine. The western edge of the bog melts into a deep lake fed by a rushing waterfall. Beside the path, an ancient snapping turtle rises to the surface of a stagnant muddy pool. After a brief breath of air, he disappears into the murky depths.  A path to the waterfall is here.

The footing is more stable beside the walls of the chasm, though the risk of falling rock is greater. A rusting sword blade peeks out from beneath one side of a particularly large boulder, a rotting leather boot is partially visible beneath the other side. Even an Oog-ra could determine what happened to this poor soul.  A giant limestone boulder is here.

Thick, slimy bubbles emerge to the surface of the deep bog and burst with a sickening sound that startles the prey of a nearby snake into hopping away at the last second. Low-hanging cypress branches shade the already dark waters, making them appear much more sinister than the surrounding bog. Somehow life still must go on here,as the splashing of fish diving beneath the exposed roots of the trees can still be heard.

Muddy footprints lead from the deeper waters of the bog up toward the edge of the muck.  Oddly enough, there are no footprints coming the other way, as if some large creature crawled out of the sludge to shore. Tiny winged insects buzz all around you, creating eerie harmonies with their wings. Cypress leaves are scattered all throughout the area, with some floating lazily in the waters and others stuck comically atop mounds of mud.

The rock strewn path gives way to cool, spongy earth as one heads into the bog. Tiny insects with paddle-shaped appendages dance across the surface of some standing water as tall grasses sway to and fro with the breeze. Deep in the bog, a piercing cry is quickly silenced as some unfortunate animal meets its fate by either being swallowed up in the muck or being attacked by the bog's more ferocious creatures.

A rocky path skirts the base of a sheer limestone cliff. Despite the unstable footing on the loose stone, this path is far quicker than slogging through the dangerous bog. Tiny pebbles click against the trail as they lose their place in the rock wall, leaving small niches in the jagged surface. To the northwest, the size of the fallen rocks is noticeably larger.

[Muddy Bog.]

Thick, slimy bubbles emerge to the surface of the deep bog and burst with a sickening sound that startles the prey of a nearby snake into hopping away at the last second. Low-hanging cypress branches shade the already dark waters, making them appear much more sinister than the surrounding bog. Somehow life still must go on here,as the splashing of fish diving beneath the exposed roots of the trees can still be heard.

[Muddy Bog.]

The rock strewn path gives way to cool, spongy earth as one heads into the bog. Tiny insects with paddle-shaped appendages dance across the surface of some standing water as tall grasses sway to and fro with the breeze. Deep in the bog, a piercing cry is quickly silenced as some unfortunate animal meets its fate by either being swallowed up in the muck or being attacked by the bog's more ferocious creatures.

[Muddy Bog.]

A well worn path clings to the base of the ravine wall, the riot of reeds and rushes threatening to claim it. Recently laid deer tracks come to an abrupt end at a site of obvious struggle. The bent stalks of marsh grasses indicate the direction the unlucky animal was dragged, with bits of bloody fur littering its path. On the ravine wall, some jokester has written in fading chalk, "No swimming allowed."

As the elevation drops to the west, this muddy bog gives way to a large lake. Clear paths are visible along the walls of the ravine to both the southwest and northwest, venturing to the center of the bog will require careful foot placement to avoid the stagnant pools and deep muck. Walking through the dark waters that pools atop the sludge beneath can prove dangerous for even the most sure-footed hunter.

A rocky path skirts the base of a sheer limestone cliff. Despite the unstable footing on the loose stone, this path is far quicker than slogging through the dangerous bog. Tiny pebbles click against the trail as they lose their place in the rock wall, leaving small niches in the jagged surface. To the northwest, the size of the fallen rocks is noticeably larger.

This area is illuminated.
In the area are Orianna the Noble Anthian (flying 20 feet above ground), Ariella the Anthian (flying 20 feet above ground), Kambralyn the Noble Fir Elf, and Clive the Noble Drag-al (holding a flaming rag wrapped wyvern bone).
Obvious paths: southeast south southwest west northwest.

The bog is less murky at this juncture, with the cleaner waters of the lake cleansing the mud beneath.  Even some silverback fishes feed near some floating logs, their backs arching grafully as they leap out as the baby dragonflies that buzz overhead. The vegetation that covers the logs are noticeably healthier than the scraggly trees that inhabit the rest of the bog.  Some rotting mossy sprout-covered logs are here.

To the west, the brilliantly clear waters of the lake glitter with schools of leaping silverback fish. The view is a startling contrast to the ominously dark waters that make up the home for the bog's denizens. Even the bird nesting in nearby cypress trees seem depressed when they lean their heads down to clean the mud off their feet. The view east seems darker still as the bog waters deepen into blackness.

The bog is less murky at this juncture, with the cleaner waters of the lake cleansing the mud beneath.  Even some silverback fishes feed near some floating logs, their backs arching grafully as they leap out as the baby dragonflies that buzz overhead. The vegetation that covers the logs are noticeably healthier than the scraggly trees that inhabit the rest of the bog.  Some rotting mossy sprout-covered logs and a chain linked steel helm are here.

A subtle under-current pulls the standing reeds to lean slightly south with their leaves trailing down into the water. A large rock lizard flicks its tongue into the air as it scuttles up onto a large rock in pursuit of its dinner. Parts of the rock seem to move as the lizard abruptly vanishes into its depths.

[Muddy Bog.]

To the west, the brilliantly clear waters of the lake glitter with schools of leaping silverback fish. The view is a startling contrast to the ominously dark waters that make up the home for the bog's denizens. Even the bird nesting in nearby cypress trees seem depressed when they lean their heads down to clean the mud off their feet. The view east seems darker still as the bog waters deepen into blackness.

This area is illuminated.
You see the 1st water crule.
In the area are Orianna the Noble Anthian (flying 20 feet above ground), Ariella the Anthian (flying 20 feet above ground), Kambralyn the Noble Fir Elf, Kithrael the Fir Elf, and Clive the Noble Drag-al (holding a flaming rag wrapped wyvern bone).

Muddy footprints lead from the deeper waters of the bog up toward the edge of the muck.  Oddly enough, there are no footprints coming the other way, as if some large creature crawled out of the sludge to shore. Tiny winged insects buzz all around you, creating eerie harmonies with their wings. Cypress leaves are scattered all throughout the area, with some floating lazily in the waters and others stuck comically atop mounds of mud.  A moonsilver oil lamp and an oak shafted bronze scythe are here.

Travel through the deep-bog is rather difficult at this section as the thick, sludgy water is as high as a human's waist. Some fallen, rotting logs jut up from underneath, providing needed handholds. Glittering yellow eyes sparkle for a brief moment in a low branch of the cypress trees.  A twisted mossy oak tree stump is here.

This area is illuminated.
You see the 1st molting crule corpse, the 1st black marsh alligator corpse, and the 2nd black marsh alligator.

[Muddy Bog.]

Travel through the deep-bog is rather difficult at this section as the thick, sludgy water is as high as a human's waist. Some fallen, rotting logs jut up from underneath, providing needed handholds. Glittering yellow eyes sparkle for a brief moment in a low branch of the cypress trees.  A twisted mossy oak tree stump is here.

This area is illuminated.
You see the 1st molting crule corpse, the 1st black marsh alligator corpse, and the 2nd black marsh alligator.
In the area are Orianna the Noble Anthian (flying 20 feet above ground), Ariella the Anthian (flying 20 feet above ground), Kambralyn the Noble Fir Elf, and Clive the Noble Drag-al (seated and holding a flaming rag wrapped wyvern bone).
Obvious paths: north northeast east southeast south southwest west northwest.

The 2nd black marsh alligator advances towards Kambralyn.

A large rock lizard flicks its tongue into the air as it scuttles up onto a large rock in pursuit of its dinner. Parts of the rock seem to move as the lizard abruptly vanishes into its depths. After a brief silence following a large gulping sound, the cacaphony of insects returns to its normal volume.

The murky waters of the bog deepen here, and continue to do so to the east, making any movement on foot a sluggish task. Scraggly moss dangles from low hanging cypress trees, providing as yet another obstacle to overcome within the murk. Insects chirp and trill from every angle, almost disguising the low baying of a strange animal nearby; a threat or a warning?  Some stooped cypress trees, some low hanging moss, and an open tattered pouch are here.

A rotting log, home to several winged insects, spans a large pool of murky water that lies between the limestone walls of the ravine. It looks stable enough to support a significant amount of weight, and judging by the air bubbles that rise to the surface of the murky water at regular intervals, it is probably best to keep ones extremities above the water level in this boggy marsh.

Thick, slimy bubbles emerge to the surface of the deep bog and burst with a sickening sound that startles the prey of a nearby snake into hopping away at the last second. Low-hanging cypress branches shade the already dark waters, making them appear much more sinister than the surrounding bog.

A well worn path clings to the base of the ravine wall, the riot of reeds and rushes threatening to claim it. Recently laid deer tracks come to an abrupt end at a site of obvious struggle. The bent stalks of marsh grasses indicate the direction the unlucky animal was dragged, with bits of bloody fur littering its path. On the ravine wall, some jokester has written in fading chalk, "No swimming allowed."

Even the bird nesting in nearby cypress trees seem depressed when they lean their heads down to clean the mud off their feet.

Several painted arrow shafts stick up out of the path at crazy angles, suggesting some kind of crude hunter's marker.  Why anyone would want to mark a path through the edge of the bog is anyone's guess. The leafy shoot of an oak tree has a pitiful hold in the ground with its roots almost completely exposed.  A family of beetles has taken residence under its branches and made a hearty meal from the lower leaves.  Some broken blackened acorns and a closed platinum chest are here.

A furry, raccoon-like animal scrambles to free his back legs from the mud and get back into the cleaner fishing waters.  A lizard drowsing on some nearby rocks watches the animal's movements intensely, twitching its tail. The path that snakes around the the east is hard to make out, making it easy to wander toward the deeper waters if one is not careful.

The bog is less murky at this juncture, with the cleaner waters of the lake cleansing the mud beneath.  Even some silverback fishes feed near some floating logs, their backs arching grafully as they leap out as the baby dragonflies that buzz overhead. The vegetation that covers the logs are noticeably healthier than the scraggly trees that inhabit the rest of the bog.  Some rotting mossy sprout-covered logs are here.

The rock strewn path gives way to cool, spongy earth as one heads into the bog. Tiny insects with paddle-shaped appendages dance across the surface of some standing water as tall grasses sway to and fro with the breeze. Deep in the bog, a piercing cry is quickly silenced as some unfortunate animal meets its fate by either being swallowed up in the muck or being attacked by the bog's more ferocious creatures.

Muddy footprints lead from the deeper waters of the bog up toward the edge of the muck.  Oddly enough, there are no footprints coming the other way, as if some large creature crawled out of the sludge to shore. Tiny winged insects buzz all around you, creating eerie harmonies with their wings. Cypress leaves are scattered all throughout the area, with some floating lazily in the waters and others stuck comically atop mounds of mud.

A rocky path skirts the base of a sheer limestone cliff. Despite the unstable footing on the loose stone, this path is far quicker than slogging through the dangerous bog. Tiny pebbles click against the trail as they lose their place in the rock wall, leaving small niches in the jagged surface. To the northwest, the size of the fallen rocks is noticeably larger.

Long tendrils of dark green moss drape from hanging branches. The curtain of ancient cypress obscures the view deeper into the bog. Brushing them aside only reveals more cypress and stringy moss.

[Muddy Bog.]

The bog is less murky at this juncture, with the cleaner waters of the lake cleansing the mud beneath.  Even some silverback fishes feed near some floating logs, their backs arching grafully as they leap out as the baby dragonflies that buzz overhead. The vegetation that covers the logs are noticeably healthier than the scraggly trees that inhabit the rest of the bog.  Some rotting mossy sprout-covered logs are here.

The bog is less murky at this juncture, with the cleaner waters of the lake cleansing the mud beneath.  Even some silverback fishes feed near some floating logs, their backs arching grafully as they leap out as the baby dragonflies that buzz overhead. The vegetation that covers the logs are noticeably healthier than the scraggly trees that inhabit the rest of the bog.  Some rotting mossy sprout-covered logs and an open blood-stained lionskin sack are here.

A furry, raccoon-like animal scrambles to free his back legs from the mud and get back into the cleaner fishing waters.

Several painted arrow shafts stick up out of the path at crazy angles, suggesting some kind of crude hunter's marker.  Why anyone would want to mark a path through the edge of the bog is anyone's guess. The leafy shoot of an oak tree has a pitiful hold in the ground with its roots almost completely exposed.  A family of beetles has taken residence under its branches and made a hearty meal from the lower leaves.  Some broken blackened acorns are here.

Muddy footprints lead from the deeper waters of the bog up toward the edge of the muck.  Oddly enough, there are no footprints coming the other way, as if some large creature crawled out of the sludge to shore. Tiny winged insects buzz all around you, creating eerie harmonies with their wings. Cypress leaves are scattered all throughout the area, with some floating lazily in the waters and others stuck comically atop mounds of mud.

[Muddy Bog.]

The rock strewn path gives way to cool, spongy earth as one heads into the bog. Tiny insects with paddle-shaped appendages dance across the surface of some standing water as tall grasses sway to and fro with the breeze. Deep in the bog, a piercing cry is quickly silenced as some unfortunate animal meets its fate by either being swallowed up in the muck or being attacked by the bog's more ferocious creatures.

Thick, slimy bubbles emerge to the surface of the deep bog and burst with a sickening sound that startles the prey of a nearby snake into hopping away at the last second. Low-hanging cypress branches shade the already dark waters, making them appear much more sinister than the surrounding bog. Somehow life still must go on here,as the splashing of fish diving beneath the exposed roots of the trees can still be heard.

The path of four leaf clove shaped flagstones leads past a small clean shack and into a well formed tunnel through the thorn bushes to the east and the Caersech to the west. The small shack is set back from the road, its walls built of a whitewashed birch. A sturdy corral, filled with well-fed horses, stands to the left of the shack. A matched pair of dapple grays stand in front of the shack waiting to take their human baggage to their destination. To the left of the door, behind a small paned window, a beautiful Fir Elf female takes coin and in return, with a charming smile, directs those who have paid their fare into the waiting room.  A small shack, a freshly painted sign, a notice of non-refund, and a small winding stone pathway are here.

Carefully winding its way up the base of the tree, and wrapping itself around the stairs, a flowering jasmine vine grows tall and lush. Dark scars from a past fire are almost hidden under tufts of fresh growth and moss. A large gap, nearly sixteen feet in distance, rests between the base of a set of stairs and the forest floor. A long moonsilver cord hangs down the side of the tree. If one pulls it, the long Elven rope will descend from above, allowing them to enter the great city of Treehaven. Bright green leaves of clover have begun springing up through the ashy soil in conjunction with soft moss to lend a durable cushion to this well-traveled spot.  Some vine-covered steps circling the tree, a freshly painted wooden sign, a healthy green patch of clover, a flowing marble fountain, some clover shaped stones, some sweet scented flowering jasmine vines, and a long woven moonsilver cord are here.

You follow Kambralyn through a large wooden ladder...

[Treehaven, Main Platform]

Sticking out into the walkway is a number of new sprouts, stretching to reach the sun from their shaded residence. The planks resting upon the supporting branches provide a wonderful lookout of the forest surrounding the city. The delicate railing appears to have grown from the tree itself it appears so natural.  A large wooden ladder, some hanging flower pots, and some hanging vegetable pots are here.

This area is illuminated.
In the area are Orianna the Noble Anthian, Owynn the Fir Elf, Autumn the Fir Elf, Ariella the Anthian (flying 10 feet above ground), Kambralyn the Noble Fir Elf, and Clive the Noble Drag-al (holding a flaming rag wrapped wyvern bone).
Obvious paths: east* northwest*.

You follow Kambralyn northwest...

[Treehaven, Main Platform]

Thick and strong limbs have reached out from the base of the Mother Tree. The hearty limbs have twisted and woven themselves into an intricate staircase. Other limbs have woven into a firm and solid platform. Smaller, tenderer, limbs have gracefully grown up around the railing. Bright green leaves fan out between the gaps, and create a cool and shady walkway. The railing itself, made of interwoven strips of oak and maple, creates a lovely barrier to allow one to admire the forest below, but not fall to their death.  An intricately woven leaf stairway leading up is here.

Brown and red leaves dance with the wind across the deck of the walkway, twirling and shifting in a slow, unending sway. Beyond the railing of the walkway is a breathtaking view of the surrounding forest. The few scarred trees in sight show as much growth and life as their numerous young neighbors.

You follow Kambralyn northeast...

[Treehaven, Main Platform]

Nestled in the branches above the walkway is the bottom of a rather large building. Small, young branches stretch out from the trunk of the Mother Tree, reaching for open air and sunlight. A beautifully crafted set of latticework serves as a railing along the edge of the wooden decking.  A long vine bridge and an ornately crafted oak ramp are here.

Delicately crafted latticework serves as the railing opposite the recovering Mother tree. An arching bridge, which has slowly begun to be replaced by interwoven branches from the Mother Tree and the one to the north, spans the gap between the platform and the walkway residing against the nothern tree.

[Treehaven, Oaken Bridge.]

Finely carved oak filigree lines the top edges of the oaken beams that serve as railing for the wooden bridge. Carvings of young firian maidens stand upon the ends of the handrails, decorating the walkway that spans the platforms between the Northern Tree and Mother Tree. Lush limbs have carefully wrapped around the bottom and sides of the bridge, creating a natural and firm foundation. The view of the surrounding forest is breathtaking.
