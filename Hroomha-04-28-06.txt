The road coming in from the north bends around to the southwest here as it makes its way through an open field. Used by travelers most of the year, the fields host parties and day excursions from the city in good weather.  A frozen jagged lightning bolt is here.

The platform on which you stand is made out of a thick glass, lending a distorted view of clouds and stars lazily passing beneath it. A powerful, softly humming force provides an unseen wall for safety of its passengers as the platform floats mysteriously upon the air. Within the bubble of energy, be it day or night, the air glows a combination of fiery reds and oranges against a darkened blue. Stars faintly glow and twinkle in the dusty light of both the sun and the moon.  A thick transparent glass platform, some glowing twinkling stars, a fiery sunset of varying hues, some floating glass steps, and some misty grey spiraling clouds heading down are here.

An ornate wrought iron fence, detailed with the various runes for each class, surrounds a raised platform in the center of the area; the runes glow and pulsate. The clouds beneath your feet give gently with each footstep, leaving ethereal impressions momentarily before fluffing back up. Above, the sky is alive with streaks of lightening that dance back and forth between more clouds and illuminate the orange-red sky with flashes of brilliant white. Misty letters swirl before you, shifting and melding together into sentences.  Some fluffy white clouds, some glowing dancing lightning streaks, some misty swirling words in the sky, a hovering oak door partially open, an open runesilver handled glass trapdoor, and some floating glass steps are here.

Seats of clouds circle in the air, providing a view of a plush, green forest. An invisible barrier provides steady footing high above the ground, and levitating purple discs of energy lead to each observation chair. The grayish clouds beneath the barrier swirl and form various runic shapes before breaking apart and reforming. Flashes of brilliant white light erupt from cloud to cloud before changing their shape, a few of the flashes making contact with the land below.  Some glowing rune-inscribed purple runesilver levitating discs, some fluffy white clouds, and a frozen jagged lightning bolt are here.

Passing through the door, you have entered another plane of existence. The night sky folds like dark blue runesilk against a backdrop of twinkling stars. A large moon shines its soft brilliance upon a floating glass stage, providing a natural spotlight to those performing. Tables and chairs hover a few feet from the floor, covered in a rich velvety green grass, while small levitating discs act as stairs to and from them. Tumultuous light flashes behind the door, leading back to the entrance of the Faire.  A softly illuminated moon and shining stars, some magickally suspended tables, some magickally suspended chairs, a circular glass levitating stage, and a hovering oak door partially open are here.

High above in the fiery sky - not quite night, not quite day - hang tiny flickering lights in the runic shape of protection. An occasional rune plummets to the clouds that serve as the magickally structured walkway, illuminating the touched area and sending arcs of electricity between one ionic light to another. The clouds continually shift beneath you; the shapes always in a state of flux.  Some fluffy white clouds, some flaming flickering protection runes, a smoke and fire MAGICK ITEMS sign, and an open chest are here.

Clear, thick runic-etched glass makes up the walls and floor of this room, each giving a spectacular view of the festival grounds. A large display case floats midair, displaying an array of fantastical items. Small sun and moon shaped orbs orbit around each other, casting a greenish light upon the glass. At first glance, there does not appear to exit, but a flickering of shifting of scenery against one wall indicates it is only an illusion.  A glowing hovering yellowed sunstone orb, a glowing hovering bluish moonstone orb, and an open translucent pale blue silk curtain are here.

                                    Visualization #1 is:
A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.

                                    Visualization #2 is:
A cool draft from the archway to the northwest hits you in the face. You hear voices murmuring, almost chanting, beyond the arch. A narrow stairway leads upward, providing an alternate exit from this room.

                                    Visualization #3 is:
Everything in this room has been colored green. This is where you will wait until it is your time to enter the arena. Food and drink have been placed on the tables to help you pass the time. A door leads into the arena and a portal leads back to the OOC Inn.
