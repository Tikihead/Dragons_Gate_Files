The splintered bone ladder rises up into the darkness, as the pit seems to expand on either side.  Halfway up the slippery walls, the muddy pit opens into a crudely burrowed hole.  Sloping upwards the hole is just about the right size for a large Oog-ra to transverse, if they crawl through on their knees.  Very little can be seen through hole, but given the options, up through the hole appears better than back down into the muddy pit.  A steelwood handled iron flanged mace and a crude hand-carved ebony snake figurine are here.

The splintered bone ladder rises up into the darkness, as the pit seems to expand on either side.  Halfway up the slippery walls, the muddy pit opens into a crudely burrowed hole.  Sloping upwards the hole is just about the right size for a large Oog-ra to transverse, if they crawl through on their knees.  Very little can be seen through hole, but given the options, up through the hole appears better than back down into the muddy pit.  A steelwood handled iron flanged mace and a crude hand-carved ebony snake figurine are here.

A muddy hole lies directly beneath a dense sticker strewn bush.  Pressed up against a tall wooden wall, the bush has obviously grown wild for many years and has been left to grow wild.  The dense, overgrown foliage blocks the view into the surrounding area.  A knotted rope has been tied to one of the larger branches of the bush and leads up over the top of the wall.  A gap in the bushes is here.

A thick wooden wall surrounds an encampment and protects it from the surrounding wild lands.  A well-fortified gate is set within the wall.  On each side of the gate, a guard tower stands sentinel, clearly giving the guards within a view of the surrounding area.  The clang of weapon meeting weapon, echoes from somewhere within the camp.  A door, some bushes, and a closed tall wooden gate are here.

The rickety dock gives way to soft packed soil.  A freshly made path cuts through the dense forest vegetation to the west. The smell of fresh lumber wafts through the air. A large magnificent building has been built next to the last step of the docks. Travelers pause and take a glance into the beautiful window front of the building, their pleasure at seeing such nice items is evident on their faces.  Some flapping colorful flags, a ship shaped rosewood hanging sign, and an open dazzling painted lemonwood door are here.

To the west are the market grounds, several small farms and a few settlements. To the north a moat full of vegetation and algae runs a lazy circle around a small ancient keep.  A closed tall wooden gate is here.

This area is illuminated.
You see the 1st city guardsman and the 2nd city guardsman.
Obvious paths: southeast*.

Large spikes line the bottom of this murky pit.  A dim light casts its muted glow from a single torch mounted high above.  In the filthy water covering the floor a rotting corpse bobs up and down leaving ripples along the waters surface.  Through the dim light, a makeshift ladder of cracked and splintered bones have been driven into the earth leading up the slippery walls.

The splintered bone ladder rises up into the darkness, as the pit seems to expand on either side.  Halfway up the slippery walls, the muddy pit opens into a crudely burrowed hole.  Sloping upwards the hole is just about the right size for a large Oog-ra to transverse, if they crawl through on their knees.  Very little can be seen through hole, but given the options, up through the hole appears better than back down into the muddy pit.

A muddy hole lies directly beneath a dense sticker strewn bush.  Pressed up against a tall wooden wall, the bush has obviously grown wild for many years and has been left to grow wild.  The dense, overgrown foliage blocks the view into the surrounding area.  A knotted rope has been tied to one of the larger branches of the bush and leads up over the top of the wall.  A gap in the bushes is here.

A muddy hole lies directly beneath a dense sticker strewn bush.  Pressed up against a tall wooden wall, the bush has obviously grown wild for many years and has been left to grow wild.  The dense, overgrown foliage blocks the view into the surrounding area.  A knotted rope has been tied to one of the larger branches of the bush and leads up over the top of the wall.  A gap in the bushes is here.

Through the gate lies the city of Spur, the major center of trade and civilization on the plains. The dusty road leading through the gates is well traveled, and walls of the city are in good repair. A small shack sits to the west of the road, during most times of the day a dusty coach can be seen waiting in front, its horses stomping with impatience to be gone. To the right of the door is a small window, its opening covered with metal bars. An old man, missing most of his teeth, waits patiently for the travelers to pay their fare, and then directs them into the waiting area. On the east side of the road a billowing multicolored tent has been erected, the hustle and bustle of merchants and customers can be seen coming and going at all times of the day.

The occasional locked gate marks the entrance to some of the more hidden estates of Spurs nobility. From this broad avenue, little can be seen of their splendor. Behind the imposing gate recedes a proud drive, disappearing mysteriously into the trees. If not for the large imposing tower rising above the hedges it would be hard to discern anything was beyond the gate. It is apparent the residents do not wish to be disturbed.

The tangy-sweet smell of metal and leather permeate the air of this shop. A stout Hithual wearing a leather apron barks an order to a young apprentice who lets out a yelp and rushes to the back of the shop to carry out his master's wishes. The shopkeeper mumbles about lazy youngsters and returns to oiling a fine looking leather weapon harness, leaving you to examine his wares on your own.   Some glowing quartz faced copper lanterns and a closed polished oak door are here.

The tangy-sweet smell of metal and leather permeate the air of this shop. A stout Hithual wearing a leather apron barks an order to a young apprentice who lets out a yelp and rushes to the back of the shop to carry out his master's wishes. The shopkeeper mumbles about lazy youngsters and returns to oiling a fine looking leather weapon harness, leaving you to examine his wares on your own.   Some glowing quartz faced copper lanterns and a closed polished oak door are here.

The tangy-sweet smell of metal and leather permeate the air of this shop. A stout Hithual wearing a leather apron barks an order to a young apprentice who lets out a yelp and rushes to the back of the shop to carry out his master's wishes. The shopkeeper mumbles about lazy youngsters and returns to oiling a fine looking leather weapon harness, leaving you to examine his wares on your own.   Some glowing quartz faced copper lanterns and a closed polished oak door are here.

A stout Hithual wearing a leather apron barks an order to a young apprentice who lets out a yelp and rushes to the back of the shop to carry out his master's wishes. The shopkeeper mumbles about lazy youngsters and returns to oiling a fine looking leather weapon harness, leaving you to examine his wares on your own.

The tangy-sweet smell of metal and leather permeate the air of this shop. A stout Hithual wearing a leather apron barks an order to a young apprentice who lets out a yelp and rushes to the back of the shop to carry out his master's wishes. The shopkeeper mumbles about lazy youngsters and returns to oiling a fine looking leather weapon harness, leaving you to examine his wares on your own.   Some glowing quartz faced copper lanterns and a closed polished oak door are here.

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.

The tangy-sweet smell of metal and leather permeate the air of this shop. A stout Hithual wearing a leather apron barks an order to a young apprentice who lets out a yelp and rushes to the back of the shop to carry out his master's wishes. The shopkeeper mumbles about lazy youngsters and returns to oiling a fine looking leather weapon harness, leaving you to examine his wares on your own.   Some glowing quartz faced copper lanterns and a closed polished oak door are here.

The tangy-sweet smell of metal and leather permeate the air of this shop. A stout Hithual wearing a leather apron barks an order to a young apprentice who lets out a yelp and rushes to the back of the shop to carry out his master's wishes. The shopkeeper mumbles about lazy youngsters and returns to oiling a fine looking leather weapon harness, leaving you to examine his wares on your own.   Some glowing quartz faced copper lanterns and a closed polished oak door are here.
