You follow Arkayne south...

[Road.]

Even though it shows heavy wear, the road is in remarkably good repair. It was built by expert craftsmen to withstand the rigors of time and use. Evidence of recent repairs indicate that any problems are dealt with quickly and competently.  Some dried crimson streaks of blood and an open old wooden trash wagon are here.

In the area is Arkayne the Noble Draco.
Obvious paths: north* south* southwest*.

You follow Arkayne southwest...

[Field.]

A broad strip of grassland that follows the main road east of you, this meadow is often used by the local aristocracy for picnicking and partying on good days. The city guardsmen keep the field clear of riffraff all year round, just to be safe.  A hole is here.

You follow Arkayne southwest...

[Field.]

You are in a wide strip of field that runs along the main road leading into Spur's residential district. The local constabulary sees to it that vagrants don't try to bed down here. They direct them to the field to the southeast.

You follow Arkayne south...

[Road.]

The road coming in from the northeast bends to the south here as it cuts through the open fields. A branch leads off to the west and the river in the distance. A signpost sporting direction arrows stands to one side.

Obvious paths: north* northeast* east* southeast* south* west*.

You follow Arkayne south...

[Road.]

The open field to the east is balanced by the fence surrounding the fairgrounds to the west. The road here hasn't seen much heavy traffic since the docks were completed, diverting most of the southbound traffic to the ships.

Obvious paths: north* northeast* east* south*.

You follow Arkayne south...

[Road.]

The road bends from the southwest to the north here. A gateway leads off to the southeast and a dirt-packed road there. A small farmhouse can be seen at its end, the barn nearby towering over it.

Obvious paths: north* northeast* south* southwest*.

You follow Arkayne southwest...

[Road.]

This main road leading into the Spur shows some signs of disrepair. At one time, this was the primary route in and out of the city. Since the docks were completed however, upkeep of this section of road is less important. It shows.

This area is illuminated.
In the area is Arkayne the Noble Draco.
Obvious paths: northeast* southeast* southwest*.

You follow Arkayne southwest...

[Road.]

A gateway to the west serves as one of the two main entrances to Spur's fairgrounds. To the south, you can barely make out the dark line of the hedge, a thick growth of trees and bushes that separates the true wilds from the tame city lands.  An iron gate is here.

Obvious paths: northeast* east* south*.

You follow Arkayne south...

[Road.]

Stretching as far as the eye can see to the east and west is the hedge. A thick line of trees and shrubs that serves as a natural wall between civilization and wilderness. A small outpost stands guard here, its door open to friends, barred to enemies.

This area is illuminated.
In the area is Arkayne the Noble Draco.
Obvious paths: north* northeast* south*.

You follow Arkayne south...

[Road.]

This narrow tunnel through the hedge leads up to the gateway that lets out to the wilderness beyond. Though it used to see heavy traffic from the south, the docks have made this gate largely a place of semi-banishment for the guards.  An open bronze gate is here.

This area is illuminated.
In the area is Arkayne the Noble Draco.
Obvious paths: north*.

You follow Arkayne through an open bronze gate...

[Wilderness gate.]

Set within a wide tunnel leading through the hedge to the north is the Wilderness Gate. It separates the settled lands of Spur from the open plains to the south of the city. The plains stretch as far as the eyes can see, the horizon and the walls of the fort down the road the only blemishes of the grassy landscape in the distance. The stones of the road are smoothly set together, well built to withstand heavy travel. A broken wagon wheel, discarded some time ago, covers a spot of nearby grass, weeds trying to climb through the spokes.  An open bronze gate is here.

Obvious paths: east* southeast* south* southwest* west*.

You follow Arkayne southwest...

[Southern Tradeway.]

The tradeway runs across the open grasslands northeast towards the Spur, and southwest towards distant lands and eventually, the coast. The plains to the south and east seem totally indifferent to your existence. Just ahead, a small path moves up a village of huts spread out in a semi-circle. In the center of the village a giant fire pit sits where barbarians who wander through the village can sit around to stay warm.  A worn grassy path is here.

Obvious paths: north* northeast* east* southeast* south* southwest* west* northwest*.

You follow Arkayne southwest...

[Southern Tradeway.]

The stone paved tradeway stretches across the open plains, interrupting nature's task of consuming the land. An endless sea of grass surrounds you, lapping at the road much like the tides against a beach. The faintly damp wind occasionally blowing in from the west smells of earth. Some of the stones in the road interlock together to form the crude image of a lion. There is no discerning if it was done on purpose or sheer accident.

You follow Arkayne southwest...

[Southern Tradeway.]

Only the well-built, stone tradeway gives any hint of civilization ever having had any presence here. The tall grasses limit visibility nearby, hiding any wildlife that may be waiting for prey to stumble too close. A few blades of grass sway slightly in the breeze, some of them broken by the passing of something heavy over them. One of the larger stones in the road, broken loose from its mortar, waits patiently to be repaired.

You follow Arkayne southwest...

[Southern Tradeway.]

The grass rises taller and taller in every direction further limiting view just off the roadside. A second glance reveals that this is the lowest point in a large, shallow depression. The tradeway sinks a little lower as it gets closer to the river off to the west. A ditch runs alongside the river's side of the road, small puddles of water filling the bottom. Trickles filter into the puddles from the grass beyond as mosquitoes dart across the muddy surfaces.

[Plains near river.]

There is a strong sense of vibrancy coming from the Darkith as it flows southwest. Even the grasses along its banks are thriving as they fight for dominance at the river side.

You follow Arkayne southwest...

[Plains near river.]

A narrow river from the east flows into the Darkith to the west. Though it's a strong river in its own right, its waters are barely noticed at the confluence as they are quickly consumed by the larger river's mighty currents.

[The Darkith River]

The relative calm of the Darkith's muddy riverbank is quickly shattered as you gaze upon a dark, ghastly looking ship only a few hundred yards away. A group of menacing clouds hang directly over the ship.

Obvious paths: north* east*.

You follow Arkayne north...

[The Darkith River]

As you wade further into the waters of the Darkith, you see that the dark, decrepit ship has lodged itself on a large sandbar. The waters around you remain fairly calm, though the muddy river bottom makes footing a bit treacherous.

You follow Arkayne north...

[The Darkith River]

The current grows strong as you near the midpoint between the riverbank and the sandbar, almost threatening to pull you under. You try your hardest to keep the foul, turbulent water as far from your mouth as possible. From here, you can make out the name of the dark ship stuck on the sandbar: "The Siren".

You follow Arkayne north...

[Sandbar]

The feel of sand beneath your feet feels welcome in comparison with swimming the Darkith. Bits of black and green seaweed that have washed up onto the squishy, yet solid sands. The area grows darker towards the west.

This area is illuminated.

Obvious paths: south* west*.

You follow Arkayne west...

[Sandbar]

The sandbar ends at the rotted gangplank of The Siren.  Black clouds hanging over the area blot out the sun and dark murky waves swell around the sides of the ship.  You long to return to Spur and forget about this doomed vessel altogether.  A rotting gangplank is here.

[Gangplank]

A large rotting board serves as a gangplank to the decrepit ship.  A dense fog blankets the area and the vile stench of death wafts down from the doomed ship.  The gangplank creaks and nearly gives under your weight.  A sandbar is here.

The deck of the Siren lies in ruin. Rotted and broken planks cover the deck, making it tricky to move around. A dark fog envelops the ship, and a chilling breeze sends shivers up your spine.  A broken plank is here.

You stand shivering at the center of the long forgotten ship.  The icy winds encompassing The Siren freeze you to the core. The rotted center mast rises up into the mist here, flanked by two smaller ones to the north and south of you.  A rotting mast is here.

Debris lies scattered around the deck, making the trek across the ship a treacherous one. The mast has been smashed in two, leaving jagged splinters in your path. Moans and cries of agony echo from beyond the stairway leading below deck.  A broken mast and a stairway are here.

Through the dense fog you make out the outlines of a face. At first it views you with curiosity, then its expression quickly turns to one of anger. It then fades away as quickly as it appeared.

This area is illuminated.
You see the 1st rotting corpse and the 2nd rotting corpse.
In the area is Arkayne the Noble Draco.
Obvious paths: north* south* southwest* west* northwest*.

Arkayne swings his two-handed steel shafted moonsilver lochaber axe at the rotting corpse!
The swing is a well-delivered blow to the head.

Set within a wide tunnel leading through the hedge to the north is the Wilderness Gate. It separates the settled lands of Spur from the open plains to the south of the city. The plains stretch as far as the eyes can see, the horizon and the walls of the fort down the road the only blemishes of the grassy landscape in the distance. The stones of the road are smoothly set together, well built to withstand heavy travel. A broken wagon wheel, discarded some time ago, covers a spot of nearby grass, weeds trying to climb through the spokes.  An open bronze gate is here.

To the right of the door is a small window, its opening covered with metal bars. An old man, missing most of his teeth, waits patiently for the travelers to pay their fare, and then directs them into the waiting area. On the east side of the road a billowing multicolored tent has been erected, the hustle and bustle of merchants and customers can be seen coming and going at all times of the day.

People carrying bundles stream in from the west and rapidly lose themselves in the large crowds moving about in the vast town square. Several citizens head west with bulging coinpurses babbling excitedly about what they're going to purchase. Giggling children dart around the slower moving folks rushing on their way to spend the silvers in their pockets.  A street lantern is here.

Several city guardsmen have just finished wrestling to the ground some young tough thieves, who thought to rob one of the returning merchants.

His pleas fall on deaf ears as the guards drag him away.  A street lantern is here.

Merchant Walk comes to an abrupt end at a massive moonsilver gate.

An arch between two large buildings connects Market Circle and Market Street. The more reputable shopkeepers do business within the circle, but pay higher taxes for the privilege. The buildings have been built to last, as these merchants are no traveling tinkers. Interlocking stone walkways and colorful plantings span this central area. Despite the number of animals waiting outside the bank for their owners, the area is spotless. Loud chatter in many languages can be heard from the southwest.

For a small price, a farmer can rent a booth and directly market his goods. Both some of the best and some of the worst deals can be made within this collection of stalls.

Bazaar Path follows the line of the Spurian Wall. High above you can hear orders being barked and guards marching in rhythm. The closeness of the wall to the path has essentially blocked any breeze that might waft through the area. The stagnant air holds in the smells of food, incense and lots of bodies. It is not unusual to see the cart drivers with triangles of cloth pulled up over their nose and mouths.  A street lantern is here.

Several large carts head west, full of various items the owners are sure will sell for a decent profit. Empty carts, the sign of a prosperous day, head east. An old Thugian pulls and pushes a very stubborn donkey. Neither end seems to be cooperating with his demands. Two small children dance around the Thugian and the donkey, chanting and singing a nasty song. Quickly, he takes out a switch, which is enough encouragement for both the donkey to move and the children to run.  A street lantern is here.

The foot traffic on Bazaar Path turns south down a small trail into the heart of the Bazaar. Many of the smaller carts follow the buyers and merchants to avoid the conflicts with the larger wagons that continue west. The shouting up ahead quickens the pulse of even the most experienced seller.  A street lantern is here.

Deep, muddy ruts mar the road. A trickle of water flows from an unknown source creating a horrid hazard. Drivers curse one another for holding up the flow of traffic. Merchants and buyers carefully pick their way around the hold up, attempting to carefully navigate the slippery ground.  A street lantern is here.

Bazaar Path makes a sudden left hand turn, following the direction of the large Spurian Wall. Carts and wagons creak in protest as their heavy loads shift precariously.  Waiting for that rare item to fall from one of the merchant carts, several small Flerian children play in the dust at the side of the road.  A street lantern is here.

A break in the traffic shows a small worn path that heads to the west. Many travel that way, sure of their ability to navigate the stalls and tents that create this market place. The larger carts and those not too sure of themselves continue to head north. A small shack sits on the eastern side of the road, its door hanging precariously on its hinges.  A street lantern is here.

The going slows down briefly as someone stops dead in their tracks. Every so often one feels the need to take in the sounds and smells that are uniquely the Bazaar. Any slow down in the movement of the crowd creates a loud string of curses. The sellers are eager to get to market to get rid of their goods, and the buyers anticipate their purchases.  A street lantern is here.

The muffled noises you hear drifting in from the west come out of the Bazaar itself, a veritable hive of activity day and night. An occasional exotic smell is carried by the breeze to tantalize the nose. A large etched window displays tastefully dressed mannequins of many races.  An open sturdy mahogany door and a street lantern are here.

Further passage along Bazaar Path is blocked occasionally by brawling peasants. Fights break out over who got here first, who gets to sell first, whose goods are better and who should just pack up and leave. When guards are forced to leave their posts to settle the arguments, all involved lose.  A street lantern is here.

Many people crowd the narrow Bazaar Path, either heading towards the infamous Bazaar, or forcing their way back towards Trade Way. For a small price, a farmer can rent a booth and directly market his goods. Both some of the best and some of the worst deals can be made within this collection of stalls. The tall wall of Spur looms high to the east, and many of the guards take an early peek into the carts and the goods coming to market.  A street lantern is here.

This well-worn road separates the Bazaar to the north and Market Circle to the south. Only a Thugian could appreciate the layered odors of simmering foodstuffs and shoppers from the Bazaar.

The buildings of Market Circle stand to the south. It becomes obvious that the area through the arch is a much cleaner marketplace than the bazaar. An inviting eatery stands beside the road, its door open to those weary after a long trip to Spur, as well as those preparing to venture to the great expanses beyond the west gate. A human couple exit the building, arm in arm. A small sign stands beside the intersection.  A sign, an open glossy lacquered oak door, and a street lantern are here.

Adventurers with sacks of plundered goods leave Market Street and head west where a shrewd businessman has set up shop in this busy area of the Market District. A small shop stands slightly to the east of the arch leading into Merchant Circle, light shining through its red glass door and illuminating the store front in a cheerful, ruby glow.  A street lantern, an opaque ruby red glass door, and a gold lettered wooden sign are here.

A human couple exit the building, arm in arm. A small sign stands beside the intersection.  A sign, an open glossy lacquered oak door, and a street lantern are here.

High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.

In fact, many of the folk heading into Town Square from the south are accompanied by large bodyguards to assure their safety.

No expense has been spared to keep those who travel this road safe from the hoodlums that relish the darkness.  A street lantern and a bloody thief arm are here.

Set in the marble base is a small plaque that reads, "For those who have gone before us." Many stand for a moment as they pass this way, giving thanks for the gift of life that is given by both the apple tree and the Secians of long ago.

A wooden signpost gives the directions and distances to the two closest cities. The arrow leading west is denoted as Spur, while the one directing east states Caersech. Next to the signpost rests an elderly druid amidst a cushion of moss, leaves, and flower petals. He is currently lecturing a young apprentice on the city of Spur and the negative effects it has had on nature.

A hedge of spiky brambles forms a natural division from the lands and the swampy terrain to the south. Tall, limbless trees dot the horizon there, their bases lost in the misty depths of the gases hovering over the waters. Now and then a strange, growling sound echos up to the north, or an odd, high-pitched call of some unseen crow, probably feasting on a fallen creature hidden in the mists. The path curves away from the sounds, as popular choice has preferred to travel around the edges, rather than through the marshy sludge.

The open plains are becoming scattered with scraggly trees, the wood of which proving inefficient to use for building as the elements of nature have grown the trunks so twisted and hard in order to withstand the onslaughts of time. Circling around the northern base of a small hill, there lies the lapping edge of the swamp to the south. Small slimy creatures lie on the smooth stones near the water, darting into it at the speed of light as you near them with tiny splashes and echoing wakes blending into the small, gentle waves coming into the shore. Swarms of mosquitoes move along the land in unison, lending them the appearance of large, unified bodies hovering around for the next feast.

Ravens dark as pitch spread their feathers to a wing-span of nearly four feet, so large they are, as they quarrel over an abandoned mule carcass on the roadside breaks out. How final death seems, so casually nature simply encompasses the bodies of the fallen, through carrion hunters or moldy decay. Yet through death there be life again, any number of these ravens being sustained through this death, so they may live. Perhaps only to become sustenance for one of the swamp creatures, who, in turn, spends its life continuing the cycle.

Four sturdy walls and a roof of woven branches enclose this small tavern. From the forest floor, winding their way around the trunk of the Mother Tree, a set of intricately railed steps serve as the entrance and exit of the town of Treehaven. Strangers arriving at the top of the steps find themselves under the watchful eye of patrons seated at tables positioned about the light, airy room. A set of oak steps lead up to the new Council chambers.  An ivory inlaid pine bar, a wooden stool, a long weathered wooden bench, a long musty wooden table, some steps circling the tree, some freshly crafted oak steps, an open door, a paper covered posting board, a gilt framed painting on the wall, and an open large straw basket are here.

The latticework surrounding and covering the spiral staircase is finely crafted. The intertwining beams seem to weave a delicate pattern above you, accenting the view of the forest floor. Soft, new, growth can be seen all over the forest below. A small mound of moss has slowly begun to cover the old inn, creating a fuzzy green mound. A large pile of Elven rope sits near the silent Golem. This creature of Elindale helps defend the city by retrieving the rope that people have pushed down to the forest below.  Some steps circling the tree and a freshly carved wooden sign are here.

Carefully winding its way up the base of the tree, and wrapping itself around the stairs, a flowering jasmine vine grows tall and lush. Dark scars from a past fire are almost hidden under tufts of fresh growth and moss. A large gap, nearly sixteen feet in distance, rests between the base of a set of stairs and the forest floor. A long moonsilver cord hangs down the side of the tree. If one pulls it, the long Elven rope will descend from above, allowing them to enter the great city of Treehaven. Bright green leaves of clover have begun springing up through the ashy soil in conjunction with soft moss to lend a durable cushion to this well-traveled spot.  Some vine-covered steps circling the tree, a freshly painted wooden sign, a healthy green patch of clover, a flowing marble fountain, some clover shaped stones, some sweet scented flowering jasmine vines, and a long woven moonsilver cord are here.

The path of four leaf clove shaped flagstones leads past a small clean shack and into a well formed tunnel through the thorn bushes to the east and the Caersech to the west. The small shack is set back from the road, its walls built of a whitewashed birch. A sturdy corral, filled with well-fed horses, stands to the left of the shack. A matched pair of dapple grays stand in front of the shack waiting to take their human baggage to their destination. To the left of the door, behind a small paned window, a beautiful Fir Elf female takes coin and in return, with a charming smile, directs those who have paid their fare into the waiting room.  A small shack, a freshly painted sign, a notice of non-refund, and a small winding stone pathway are here.

A small path, its stones in the shape of four leaf clovers, winds its way through the sparse remains of a once dense undergrowth.

Recently turned dirt sits against the huge total poles, which dominate the small copse. The sky can barely be seen between the branches of the trees, which define the edge of the clearing. Much of the grass has been trampled into the loose soil of the earth.  A blackened fallen steelwood tree, a blackened fallen steelwood tree, and a tall carved wolf's head totem pole are here.

The carcass of the Druid's hut glows a deep red from the fire that consumed it. The small glade is littered with bodies of lupines and orks. Smoke snakes up from the ash, flowing through the hole in the forest room. The trees stand in silence, untouched by the flames.  A large covered gravestone, a fresh bloody ork corpse, a fresh bloody ork corpse, and a fresh bloody lupine corpse are here.

The spongy, algae-covered bottom of this dank chamber houses several species of strange fungi, filling the air with an overpowering, moldy stench. Thick mosses have wound their way up the smooth rock walls, leaving very few areas where the stone remains uncovered. Upon the exposed spots of the rock walls, faded etched patterns of knotwork designs lie, signifying that while the cavern itself may be a natural work of Nature, someone has been here before and put it to use.  A mossy opening is here.

Several simple iron sconces line the moss covered walls of this narrow passageway, long since snuffed out. Portruding slightly from the smooth rock on either side of the chamber are several rows of stone slabs, each labeled in etchings that time has rendered indescernible. At the northeastern end of the chamber, a slab is missing, leaving a deep, square hole in the cavern wall. A slight chilled breeze whisps its way about the chamber and lingers near the exposed indention.  A deep square hole in the wall is here.

A cracked mosaic of colored tiles decorates the western wall of this cavern; thick moss threatening to overcome its stark, haunting beauty. The mosiac itself depicts a scene of Firian mourners gathered within a felled city, the bodies of their brethren piled amongst the scorched landscape. A tarnished bronze plaque has been set in the lower right corner of the mosaic, etched in an ancient Firian dialect. A bitter breeze blows in from the south, and it brings with it the faint sound of a child's cry.  A tarnished bronze plaque is here.

The ceiling slopes upward and the cavern opens up considerably, allowing more room to breathe and move around than in the other chambers. Resting upon the center of the algae-laden floor is a sarcophagus that has been heavily decorated and seemingly enshrined. Stone columns to either side of the huge marble coffin have been etched to depict the scene of a peaceful harvest. For some reason, it doesn't seem that the peacefulness expressed in the columns has made its way into this darkened crypt.  A closed ivy etched marble sarcophagus and a pair of spiraling sculpted stone columns are here.

Thin stone columns line the walls throughout this cavernous passage, each of them carved with different spiraling scenes of prosperous times; a full harvest, a boom of exploration, a grand feast. The individuals within the sculpted stone wear their finest clothes as well as their most enthusiastic smiles, but the crypt is still contaminated with unease. Quiet whispers snake their way throughout the chamber, incomprehensible in language, but thoroughly obvious in tone -- the people whose remains are nestled in this crypt do not rest in peace.

A pale red sarcophagus of clay lies centered upon the soft algae that is the floor of this cavern, its surface cracked with age, but otherwise untouched. Its intricate etchings have faded somewhat, but the discernable image of a unicorn is still quite clearly visible upon its lid. It is a wonder that the lid has not been pried open at the hands of crypt thieves -- perhaps the archaic symbols etched on each of the lid's corners have something to do with that?

Against the southern wall, another large mosaic sits amongst the vine-like moss that threatens to overcome the colored tiles. The small pieces have been placed to take on the image of a few Firians in tattered rags standing around the thick trunk of a massive steelwood tree. Upon each of the Firs' faces, a look of awe and hope is visible -- quite contrary to the scene expressed in the mosaic near the entrance. Still, whisps of frigid air abound in this moss-filled cavern.  A pale green moss covered plaque is here.

More slight depressions containing Firian remains dot the northern and southern walls in this narrow passageway, each labeled faintly with small bronze plates. Moss and lichen acts as a cushioned bed to the yellowing bones; a comfort which these lost souls will likely never experience again. Sounds of unearthly unrest pierce the dank air and suddenly die down, only to begin again seconds later. There is never a full moment of peace this deep in the crypt.

Three stone sarcophagi lie next to each other against the mossy western wall, etched with uncomplicated forest scenes. There is no breeze in this chamber, but the air is still bitterly chill, as are the moaning wails that travel from wall to wall, echoing throughout the entire crypt. A scratching sound makes itself present, even against the horrible cries of those long lost, and it is coming from the direction of the three sarcophagi. Do rodents make their way down into this cave, or could it be something even less appealing?

Three stone sarcophagi lie next to each other against the mossy western wall, etched with uncomplicated forest scenes. There is no breeze in this chamber, but the air is still bitterly chill, as are the moaning wails that travel from wall to wall, echoing throughout the entire crypt. A scratching sound makes itself present, even against the horrible cries of those long lost, and it is coming from the direction of the three sarcophagi. Do rodents make their way down into this cave, or could it be something even less appealing?

Against the southern wall, another large mosaic sits amongst the vine-like moss that threatens to overcome the colored tiles. The small pieces have been placed to take on the image of a few Firians in tattered rags standing around the thick trunk of a massive steelwood tree. Upon each of the Firs' faces, a look of awe and hope is visible -- quite contrary to the scene expressed in the mosaic near the entrance. Still, whisps of frigid air abound in this moss-filled cavern.  A pale green moss covered plaque is here.

More slight depressions containing Firian remains dot the northern and southern walls in this narrow passageway, each labeled faintly with small bronze plates. Moss and lichen acts as a cushioned bed to the yellowing bones; a comfort which these lost souls will likely never experience again. Sounds of unearthly unrest pierce the dank air and suddenly die down, only to begin again seconds later. There is never a full moment of peace this deep in the crypt.  A heavy white cloth jerkin is here.

Three stone sarcophagi lie next to each other against the mossy western wall, etched with uncomplicated forest scenes. There is no breeze in this chamber, but the air is still bitterly chill, as are the moaning wails that travel from wall to wall, echoing throughout the entire crypt. A scratching sound makes itself present, even against the horrible cries of those long lost, and it is coming from the direction of the three sarcophagi. Do rodents make their way down into this cave, or could it be something even less appealing?

Against the southern wall, another large mosaic sits amongst the vine-like moss that threatens to overcome the colored tiles. The small pieces have been placed to take on the image of a few Firians in tattered rags standing around the thick trunk of a massive steelwood tree. Upon each of the Firs' faces, a look of awe and hope is visible -- quite contrary to the scene expressed in the mosaic near the entrance. Still, whisps of frigid air abound in this moss-filled cavern.  A pale green moss covered plaque is here.

A pale red sarcophagus of clay lies centered upon the soft algae that is the floor of this cavern, its surface cracked with age, but otherwise untouched. Its intricate etchings have faded somewhat, but the discernable image of a unicorn is still quite clearly visible upon its lid. It is a wonder that the lid has not been pried open at the hands of crypt thieves -- perhaps the archaic symbols etched on each of the lid's corners have something to do with that?

Thin stone columns line the walls throughout this cavernous passage, each of them carved with different spiraling scenes of prosperous times; a full harvest, a boom of exploration, a grand feast. The individuals within the sculpted stone wear their finest clothes as well as their most enthusiastic smiles, but the crypt is still contaminated with unease. Quiet whispers snake their way throughout the chamber, incomprehensible in language, but thoroughly obvious in tone -- the people whose remains are nestled in this crypt do not rest in peace.

The ceiling slopes upward and the cavern opens up considerably, allowing more room to breathe and move around than in the other chambers. Resting upon the center of the algae-laden floor is a sarcophagus that has been heavily decorated and seemingly enshrined. Stone columns to either side of the huge marble coffin have been etched to depict the scene of a peaceful harvest. For some reason, it doesn't seem that the peacefulness expressed in the columns has made its way into this darkened crypt.  A closed ivy etched marble sarcophagus and a pair of spiraling sculpted stone columns are here.

A cracked mosaic of colored tiles decorates the western wall of this cavern; thick moss threatening to overcome its stark, haunting beauty. The mosiac itself depicts a scene of Firian mourners gathered within a felled city, the bodies of their brethren piled amongst the scorched landscape. A tarnished bronze plaque has been set in the lower right corner of the mosaic, etched in an ancient Firian dialect. A bitter breeze blows in from the south, and it brings with it the faint sound of a child's cry.  A tarnished bronze plaque is here.

Several simple iron sconces line the moss covered walls of this narrow passageway, long since snuffed out. Portruding slightly from the smooth rock on either side of the chamber are several rows of stone slabs, each labeled in etchings that time has rendered indescernible. At the northeastern end of the chamber, a slab is missing, leaving a deep, square hole in the cavern wall. A slight chilled breeze whisps its way about the chamber and lingers near the exposed indention.  A deep square hole in the wall is here.

The spongy, algae-covered bottom of this dank chamber houses several species of strange fungi, filling the air with an overpowering, moldy stench. Thick mosses have wound their way up the smooth rock walls, leaving very few areas where the stone remains uncovered. Upon the exposed spots of the rock walls, faded etched patterns of knotwork designs lie, signifying that while the cavern itself may be a natural work of Nature, someone has been here before and put it to use.  A mossy opening is here.

A matched pair of dapple grays stand in front of the shack waiting to take their human baggage to their destination. To the left of the door, behind a small paned window, a beautiful Fir Elf female takes coin and in return, with a charming smile, directs those who have paid their fare into the waiting room.

Carefully winding its way up the base of the tree, and wrapping itself around the stairs, a flowering jasmine vine grows tall and lush. Dark scars from a past fire are almost hidden under tufts of fresh growth and moss. A large gap, nearly sixteen feet in distance, rests between the base of a set of stairs and the forest floor. A long moonsilver cord hangs down the side of the tree. If one pulls it, the long Elven rope will descend from above, allowing them to enter the great city of Treehaven. Bright green leaves of clover have begun springing up through the ashy soil in conjunction with soft moss to lend a durable cushion to this well-traveled spot.  Some vine-covered steps circling the tree, a freshly painted wooden sign, a healthy green patch of clover, a flowing marble fountain, some clover shaped stones, some sweet scented flowering jasmine vines, and a long woven moonsilver cord are here.

Strangers arriving at the top of the steps find themselves under the watchful eye of patrons seated at tables positioned about the light, airy room. A set of oak steps lead up to the new Council chambers.

Strange, due to the fact that they don't appear carved, painted, or placed by any hand-made means. It is as if the glyphs grew into the wood itself.

Soft moss has begun to grow on the platform and creates a soft walkway. A huge lump has begun to grow out of the tree. Someone has already decided to make this a nice spot to rest their potted plants and flowers on. Access to the Northern Tree, and the hidden tower to the west, are connected by living ropes of vines.  A vine bridge and a rope bridge are here.

Obvious paths: None.
[Treehaven, Watch Post]

A handful of planks huddle together to form a primitive, half-finished watch post. All appearances suggest that whatever work was planned will not be finished anytime soon. The sounds of the river beneath cause a cool, wet breeze to constantly flow about the branches of the tree.  A rope bridge is here.

A small wooden landing clings to the large tree trunk of the Northern Tree. A large wooden ramp leads down the main platform to the south. A short wooden railing surrounds all but one side of the platform. Vines and ropes provide access to more construction in the tree to the west.  A large wooden ramp, a vine bridge, a closed ivy etched rosewood door, and a smooth bear-etched oak emerald banded barrel are here.

The freshly built wooden walkway passes just in front of the refurbished tavern of old. Intricately crafted railings line the platform as it meanders about the Northern tree. A quaint building nestles itself within the protective branches.  An open elm door and a large wooden ramp are here.

Finely carved oak filigree lines the top edges of the oaken beams that serve as railing for the wooden bridge. Carvings of young firian maidens stand upon the ends of the handrails, decorating the walkway that spans the platforms between the Northern Tree and Mother Tree. Lush limbs have carefully wrapped around the bottom and sides of the bridge, creating a natural and firm foundation. The view of the surrounding forest is breathtaking.

Delicately crafted latticework serves as the railing opposite the recovering Mother tree.

Firm wooden planks fit snuggly to create the walkway that extends proudly upon the reconstructed supports. The view of the forest to the northwest is quite panoramic. A staircase here seems to have some enchantment, judging by the strange appearance of unicorns, bears and owls on the lower steps. Strange, due to the fact that they don't appear carved, painted, or placed by any hand-made means. It is as if the glyphs grew into the wood itself. Mysterious symbols are scattered throughout the portraits, which shimmer with a golden whisper as they are approached.

This is the main entrance of a Temple of Elindale, the inside walls perfectly smooth with glowing magickal symbols upon the surfaces. The enormity of this tree becomes apparent as one travels up the stairs to the northwest. The air holds a fresh, new ambiance, pleasantly scented with sweet sap and rich, earthly undertones.  Some glowing magickal symbols and a brown oak staircase are here.
