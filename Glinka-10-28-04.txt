[Festival of Shadows, Ghost Town.]

This small town wears the black veil of night as it nestles itself behind the shadows of the eclipsed moon. A narrow trail of dust and broken flagstones ribbons itself through a maze of lifeless trees and old buildings. The wind fills the air with the scent of burning wood as its beckoning call echoes the eerie cry of howling wolves. Amidst the glowing light of lanterns, shady figures parade and dance through the heavy velvet blanket of the shadowed moon.  Some flowing black silk streamers, a pumpkin patch, a glowing wooden bon-fire, an ominous twisted opal arch, and a glowing light orange moonstone lantern are here.

Glistening ribbons of magick slowly circle around glowing spheres of air, earth, water, and fire, which hover in the shimmering air above. Fringed turquoise satin throw pillows are scattered neatly across the opalescent white marble floor. Purple flames lick the air, as a small fire blossoms from a diamond etched disk. The etchings within the disk represent arcane rune-shapes of ages passed. The canopy above opens up to a celestial scene, where they harvest moon hangs in a deep purple velvet sky.  A swirling vortex of stars is here.

The sweet, spicy scent of burning wood carries on the air, giving warmth to the stinging chill of the rushing wind. Circles of festival goers sit around a bonfire, warming their hands as others wonder back and forth about the festival. The wind whines a slow, lingering song as a cobblestone path winds itself up to the entrance of a warping thatched roof cabin.  A festive old man smoking a pipe, a glowing orange candle in a jar, some decaying red leaves on the ground, and an open round shaped wooden door are here.

An old gray haired woman sits on a giant rocking chair beside an open window. Rocking back and forth slowly, glancing at a portrait on the wall while she sings an eerie song about those she has lost.  The notes fall and rise as the wind quietly blows and whistles. The woman's pale blue eyes turn to look at you with a placid glare. She has prepared baskets with ribbons and festively painted bags with candies and small gifts for the season. A small deep black crow gathers outside her window giving off a loud caw.  An open round shaped wooden door is here.

The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.   A flowing white marble fountain, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a marble statue of a Human, a crumbled marble statue of a Dragon, and a rosewood sign are here.

Rocking back and forth slowly, glancing at a portrait on the wall while she sings an eerie song about those she has lost.  The notes fall and rise as the wind quietly blows and whistles. The woman's pale blue eyes turn to look at you with a placid glare. She has prepared baskets with ribbons and festively painted bags with candies and small gifts for the season. A small deep black crow gathers outside her window giving off a loud caw.  An open round shaped wooden door is here.

A misty trail of white smoke slinks steadily in coiled rings from a stone chimney that hardly balances on the slanted rooftop. A silver trimmed owl rests like an ancient sentinel on the stacked stones. Its golden eyes reflect the halo of the full moon.

A lifeless tree, whose branches are like a skinless hand, hangs lazily over a large glass tank. Red crystal apples bob rapidly as the chill of night stirs the water inside the tank. As the water churns and the wind rushes through the trees, a flock of black birds escape hastily from the branches above, sending a whirlwind of leaves to the ground.

In fact, many of the folk heading into Town Square from the south are accompanied by large bodyguards to assure their safety.

Many stand for a moment as they pass this way, giving thanks for the gift of life that is given by both the apple tree and the Secians of long ago.

Every detail has been attended to display the exotic plants, in all their pampered perfection.  A street lantern and a closed rosewood door are here.

Leaving the exceptionally wealthy estates of the Spurian nobility, Noble Way heads toward the Town Square to the northwest. Along the roadside can be seen the in-city homes of successful merchants and other wealthy citizens of the Spur. The homes display a slightly different style, perhaps they are not quite so restrained; a touch more exuberance and freedom with materials is displayed.  A street lantern is here.

A small shack sits to the west of the road, during most times of the day a dusty coach can be seen waiting in front, its horses stomping with impatience to be gone. To the right of the door is a small window, its opening covered with metal bars. An old man, missing most of his teeth, waits patiently for the travelers to pay their fare, and then directs them into the waiting area. On the east side of the road a billowing multicolored tent has been erected, the hustle and bustle of merchants and customers can be seen coming and going at all times of the day.

The wind whines a slow, lingering wail through small cracks within the willow's wood.  A small platform winds itself around the bough and meets the entrance of a peculiar room with a crooked red door. At the foot of the door, two carved pumpkins glow with a soft yellowish light. Black shadows march across the innards of the tree like a parade of urchins of the night as tall and small figures in costume climb up a small wooden ladder.  Some steep spiraling stairs, an open crooked red wooden door, and a vine-covered ladder are here.

Wavering white-hot orange flames swirl from a large opal disk that hovers as a centerpiece in this immense tree. Gnarled wooden stairs spiral and climb up the walls of the rounded bough, disappearing into a dark zenith. Shapeless figures dance and undulate on the walls, creating a spectacle of slow spinning shadows that unfurl into jackals and snakes. Howls of delights roar then fade into the distance as merrymakers disappear down a slithering slide, which cascades into a void of darkness way below.  An open star etched amber door, some steep spiraling stairs, and a wickedly curled slide are here.

[Festival of Shadows, Ghost Town.]

This small town wears the black veil of night as it nestles itself behind the shadows of the eclipsed moon. A narrow trail of dust and broken flagstones ribbons itself through a maze of lifeless trees and old buildings. The wind fills the air with the scent of burning wood as its beckoning call echoes the eerie cry of howling wolves. Amidst the glowing light of lanterns, shady figures parade and dance through the heavy velvet blanket of the shadowed moon.  Some flowing black silk streamers, a pumpkin patch, a glowing wooden bon-fire, an ominous twisted opal arch, a glowing light orange moonstone lantern, and some vomit are here.

Now look around and you will find, a treasure orange and round. Its filled with special tempting treats, its waiting to be found."

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.   A flowing white marble fountain, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a marble statue of a Human, a crumbled marble statue of a Dragon, and a rosewood sign are here.

This area is illuminated.
In the area are Raex the San Elf, Clive the Noble Drag-al (holding a moonsilver oil lamp), Kraggon the Noble Hithual, Beauty the Novice Secian (holding a glowing swirling multicolored globe), Fintz the Secian (flying 10 feet above ground and holding a crystal Dragon teardrop), Romilin the Noble Psycian, Anyah the Human, and Moss the Noble Flerian.
