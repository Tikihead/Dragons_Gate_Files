>[Bank.]

The quiet hum of business fills your ears as you enter the Market Circle branch of the Rasnian Bank.  A long wooden desk at the far end of the room contains many tellers waiting to help you with your banking needs.  An open elegant gold-trimmed walnut door, a bright wooden sign, and a smooth white sharpening stone are here.

This room is illuminated.
You see the 1st governor's dread knight.
In the room are Bant the Drake, Gwen the Secian (flying beside you), Aliyah the Secian (holding a glowing swirling multicolored globe), Verbaniah the Secian (holding a flaming rose petal filled moonsilver censer), and Forsythia the Drake.
Obvious exits: None.

Bant says in Secian, "tarks tarks... "

Bant beams.

Bant glances around.

Forsythia approaches a teller and they begin speaking quietly.

Bant exclaims in Secian, "next time!"

Forsythia says to Bant in Secian, "Not this time."

Bant shuffles his feet.

Forsythia nods.

You follow Forsythia through an open elegant gold-trimmed walnut door...

[Market Circle.]

An arch between two large buildings connects Market Circle and Market Street. The more reputable shopkeepers do business within the circle, but pay higher taxes for the privilege. The buildings have been built to last, as these merchants are no traveling tinkers. Interlocking stone walkways and colorful plantings span this central area. Despite the number of animals waiting outside the bank for their owners, the area is spotless. Loud chatter in many languages can be heard from the southwest.  A marble archway, an open elegant gold-trimmed walnut door, and a wooden sign are here.

This area is illuminated.
In the area are Bant the Drake, Gwen the Secian (flying beside you), Aliyah the Secian (holding a glowing swirling multicolored globe), Verbaniah the Secian (holding a flaming rose petal filled moonsilver censer), and Forsythia the Drake.
Obvious paths: north* northeast* east* southeast* south* southwest* west* northwest*.

You follow Forsythia through a marble archway...

[Market Street.]

Market Street ends here at a large archway. People bustle in and out of the arch, some without so much as a nod. The city wall rises up to the south and west of the buildings of Market Circle. A small sign is posted on the wall beside the archway.  A street lantern is here.

You follow Forsythia north...

[Market Street.]

Situated between the well-traveled Trade Way to the north and the fine shops of Market Circle to the south, this small stretch of road is busy at all times of day. Adventurers with sacks of plundered goods leave Market Street and head west. A shrewd businessman has set up shop in this busy area of the Market District.  A street lantern is here.

This area is illuminated.
You see the 1st alley cat.
In the area are Bant the Drake, Gwen the Secian (flying beside you), Aliyah the Secian (holding a glowing swirling multicolored globe), Verbaniah the Secian (holding a flaming rose petal filled moonsilver censer), and Forsythia the Drake.

You follow Forsythia north...

[Trade & Market.]

The buildings of Market Circle stand to the south. It becomes obvious that the area through the arch is a much cleaner marketplace than the bazaar. An inviting eatery stands beside the road, its door open to those weary after a long trip to Spur, as well as those preparing to venture to the great expanses beyond the west gate. A human couple exit the building, arm in arm. A small sign stands beside the intersection.  A sign, an open glossy lacquered oak door, and a street lantern are here.

You follow Forsythia west...

[Trade Way.]

The throngs of travelers thicken as one heads east along Trade Way. An Anthian plays softly on a strange looking stringed instrument, her melodic voice filling the air. Judging by her clothing, and the number of silvers at her feet, she makes a fine living practicing her craft.  A street lantern is here.

Verbaniah just placed an iridescent shimmering silver teardrop within her open large leather backpack.

You follow Forsythia west...

[Trade Way.]

Deep grey mists surround a strange pile of rubble that lies south of the road. Occasionally a priest clad in a simple grey robe will wander past the rubble and whisper a short prayer under his breath. The fence running around the rubble is well kept, but the gate which once allowed entrance to this Temple has been chained closed.  A grey iron chained gate, a pile of rubble, and a street lantern are here.

You follow Forsythia west...

[Trade Way.]

From the city gate to the west, Trade Way continues eastward towards the busy Merchant district, past Joyeusse's Shop. The air is thick with the scent of fresh flowers. Wagons filled with goods bound for sale trundle past, their drivers hopeful of the anticipated profits. Eager young warriors venture towards the west gate and the dangers beyond.  An open carved rosewood door and a street lantern are here.

[Gateway.]

The relative safety inside Spur is a comfort to those returning from the fields and mountains. To those leaving, a massive wall of defense around the city lies ahead. Archer towers beside the gate overlook the wall, offering a painful welcome to would-be invaders. Several guards on foot patrol pass and disappear behind a thick, bluesteel banded steelwood door. Wall road stretches to the south, a wide passage between the city wall and several large buildings.  An open iron gate, an open thick stone door, and a street lantern are here.

This area is illuminated.
You see the 1st ork.

[Spur Gateway.]

Travelers from Rathan to the northwest, and the Trade Route to the south, converge at Spur's west gate. Guards posted on the ground give those seeking to enter the city a cursory once-over. Their lack of interest shows that anyone approaching has already been observed from above for some time. A grate in the ground loosens mud from wagon wheels and hooves before they pass through the gate, helping to keep the streets of Spur fairly clean.  An open giant black iron gate, a giant green oak tree, a small blue pool, a thick oak grate over the pool, and a polished stone marker are here.

The path is flanked by countless tall oaks, swaying peacefully in the wind. They do their best to hide the sky from view, making it hard to tell night from day at times. Littering the area are pieces of broken wagon, bits of human remains and dried splotches of blood. The remnants of a violent fight lie all around you, whomever used to belong to the wagon is no more than vulture food.  A bloody severed foot is here.

Old trees lay side by side with the massive boulders of the mountain, intermingling in a terrible landslide. The mountain top has broken off and slid across the eastern road stopping all forms of transportation. It would take years for mortal hands to remove the tons of stone from the original roadway to make it passable once again. Thankfully, nature has changed the landscape for the better, and has opened a gap through the mountain to the north.

[The Silver Strand.]

The purple and silver glow brightens as the tunnel walls begin to fully dissipate in the mountain breeze. To the north the partially hidden spire of a massive tower pokes through the glistening cloud cover. A purple glow reflects through the cover and across the face of the building, beautifully accented by the silver trim and polished silver spire.

This area is illuminated.
In the area are Bant the Drake (flying 10 feet above you), Gwen the Secian (flying beside you), Aliyah the Secian (flying 5 feet above you and holding a glowing swirling multicolored globe), Verbaniah the Secian (flying beside you and holding a flaming rose petal filled moonsilver censer), and Forsythia the Drake (flying beside you).

The strand has totally solidified, its silver-black surface smooth and shiny. A low humming sound permeates the air along with short thunderous bursts and flickers of lightning. The tower is almost completely in view, its shining purple walls glowing brightly. At the tip of the spire, glowing bright purple, stands a beautifully crafted scarab, its outstretched wings glistening silver.

There is but a single entrance gate and one narrow window slit high above the ground noticeable with a first glance. The silver spire hums slightly giving off a beautiful tune.

[The Crystal Tower.]

A massive purple crystal tower soars overhead, its silver spire polished to a bright shine. The walls pulse slightly as if beating like a massive heart. The mountain peak rises high on either side of the building, cradling the tower in its grasp. A massive gate protects the tower interior from any who do not belong.   An open silver-trimmed purple crystal gate is here.

Powerful magickal energy flashes through the air every so often, the reddish-blue bolts dancing off the walls, ceiling and floor.

This room is illuminated.
In the room are Bant the Drake, Gwen the Secian, Aliyah the Secian (flying beside you and holding a glowing swirling multicolored globe), Verbaniah the Secian (flying beside you and holding a flaming rose petal filled moonsilver censer), and Forsythia the Drake.

A smooth white sharpening stone, a crude wooden lockpick, a tiny shrunken skull pendant, a gnarled weathered oak branch, an open soft sack, an open flowery spidersilk pouch, an open crude doeskin pouch, a small grey pearl, a large translucent blood spinel, some gold coins, some silver coins, and an open layered wool sack are here.

Your dark journey comes once again to a sharp turn.  The soot and ash covered wall is etched with nail marks from a creature feeling its way through the darkness.  Shadows continue to bounce from wall to wall.  A crude wooden lockpick, an iron rolling pin, a quiver of bark arrows, a heavy leather skullcap, a dead grey mouse, a tiny shrunken skull pendant, some hardened lava fragments, and an open handmade bag are here.

There is nothing here but the open expanse of sky. A silvery walkway ends quite close to the east, its semi-solid footing welcome to most who cannot fly. Far northeast another part of the strand waits for a traveler to set foot on its surface to continue the journey up the mountain. A strong wind blows down from the mountain peak, attempting to bring the massive drop to the ground quickly and painfully to anyone stupid enough to wander out into the sky.  A fiery gate in the sky is here.

The tunnel leads east to a solid mountain roadway and west into a blur.

Small birds fly high overhead, circling this part of the road. The span from the edge of the road to the southern mountain face is not very far, however the drop into the valley would be suicide. On that mountain side a small cave yawns its opening next to a narrow ledge. Perhaps one could jump down to it without falling to their death...

High above the mountain base the roadway makes its climb toward the peak. Down below the cliff falls off suddenly into the valley.

Wind blows up from the valley floor and down from the cliffs above, tugging at clothing, packs and living beings alike.

                        -------------------------------------------

                                    Visualization #1 is:
Mysterious mists form the barrier around this strange garden. Nothing can be seen of the route you took to get here. Giant sized flowers bloom all around you, each one a different color and shade. A lush carpet of jewel green grass cushions your feet. The call of exotic birds echo through the air. Breaking through the path of flowers you come upon a small clump of peach trees. Luscious fruits hang from their drooping branches. Some have already been plucked and placed in a large straw basket. At the center of the stand of trees is spread a large quilted blanket. Upon closer examination of the quilt you notice each square shows a different stage of being in the life of a dragon. Quiet descends around you, filling the area with a sense of peace.

                                    Visualization #2 is:
Four sturdy walls and a roof of woven branches enclose this small tavern. From the forest floor, winding their way around the trunk of the Mother Tree, a set of intricately railed steps serve as the entrance and exit of the town of Treehaven. Strangers arriving at the top of the steps find themselves under the watchful eye of patrons seated at tables positioned about the light, airy room. A set of oak steps lead up to the new Council chambers.

                                    Visualization #3 is:
An abundant gallery of paintings depicting sacrifices and hold offerings to their god suspend from crooked iron nails. Resting beside each painting, cold black iron braziers appear to hold burned blood and bone. A few charred, blackened pieces can be found in them. Several iron chains hang along the walls of the sacrificial chamber. Along the floor, intricately placed colored slate tiles are coated in dust covered dried blood. Centering the room is a raised platform accessible through a flight of stairs. Upon this raised formation rests an altar inlaid with rows and rows of teeth.

>[Day.]

Bright light fills this room at all times of day, reminding of pure, natural sunlight.  The rays of illumination have a brassy tint to them, creating a warm hued glow upon the simple furniture of this open-air room. Only one wall stands here, a divider to some unseen area; covered in brilliant emerald vines, splitting and taking over through cracks and niches. A single dark green vine appears sturdy enough to climb. A handmade bronze sun rests upon the wall, attached at the rough hammered points, only barely visible through the vines. Furniture built of bronze and brass center around a small pond within the center of the room. Hardly deep, a few metallic-hued fish can be seen through the emerald greenish mossy waters. When night turns to day, the bronze sun glows momentarily as a pale blue mist comes from within it, creating a magickal faux sky overhead resembling that of noon time; slowly it fades away as the day truly changes and the stars outside fade from few.  A deep crack in the wall and a smooth ebony archway are here.

Upon entering this pitch black painted circular room it is difficult to find your bearings at first. Much darker in hue than the rest of the areas, the decor has been styled to represent a midnight sky.  An ebony archway barely visible rests on the far wall, magick surrounding it, preventing visibility into the area on the other side. Astonishing platinum stars inlaid into the ceiling flicker in the low pillar candle light.  Magickal platinum flamed candles made of deep black beeswax rest upon small round ebony tables.  Light fluffy pillows shaped to resemble clouds are stacked in three corners, dark blue and indigo in shade.  A few warm fleece blankets are stacked upon a black marble shelf carved into the wall, allowing visitors to keep warm even on the coldest of nights.  A winding wrought iron railed staircase, a closed smooth black marble box dotted with stars, and a smooth ebony archway are here.

A smooth gray marble floor flecked with white spreads out beneath you. A constant, calming sound of trickling water can be heard from a small matching marble fountain in the center. The fresh water trickles down from the three-tiered fountain spreading over little black and white pebbles in the basin. Pillows of bright colors, large and small, line the corner of the room, providing an inviting place for conversations and relaxation. A winding staircase with a thick wrought iron railing wraps its way upwards, only to grow hazy with wisps of mist as it reaches the ceiling. A few carved marble benches line the fountain for those that wish to sit next to it, the feet of the seating resembling that of a clawed Dragon. Affixed to one of the walls is a small plaque made of a blackened silvery-gray metal.  A blackened silver-trimmed plaque, a tall flowing marble fountain, and a mist covered cobblestone pathway are here.

>[Pathway Garden.]

Cheerful laughter can be heard echoing through this open air garden as wisps of bright colors flash past. Secians run and play a game of mid-flight tag, merrily flying past one another as their rainbow wings become a blur. Gray flecked white marble benches line a small, deep blue pool filled with cool, tranquil waters with the exception of a stray duck making a crash-landing. Various sorts of flowers from every imaginable part of Aradath sprout in full bloom in all areas, nearly overtaking the pathway. A red rosebush stands out in particular, well kept, the flowers bloom brilliantly opening to the sun. The scent of delicate floral mixed with fresh grass and tall, green leafed trees makes for an intoxicatingly fresh aroma.  A red rosebush and a mist covered cobblestone pathway are here.

The garden is surrounded by a non-symmetrical stone wall done in earthen shades, yellow roses and wild vines clinging to its stony face. A small mosaic just barely peeking out from the mass of flowers and leaves can be viewed as the sun rises. In the midst of it all, a large willow tree spreads its massive branches over the area, colorful paper lanterns hanging within. A lush blanket of natural carpet, deep green clover spouting from the ground to form a soft pathway. The edge of the pond reaches to the edge of the path, the beginning of a breathtaking garden starting here. In the distance the calls of ducks and other wildlife can be heard. From one of the tallest tree branches, the echoing hum of busy bees sound from a golden beehive, the scent of honey filling the air with a delightful aroma.  An earthen stone wall mosaic and a closed vine entwined silver gate are here.

The scent of fresh, green trodden grass, and the gentle rustling of the golden leaves overhead delighted the senses. On the edge of the property, a waterfall trickles over an embankment of several large white stones into a light green pool below. The glistening water travels down a slow moving stream caring fallen leaves and grass.  A glistening stream and an open vine entwined silver gate are here.

Several majestic willow trees, with their long drooping branches, stand at the top of a gently sloping hill. A slight wind blows among the trees and grass in this flowery meadow while a trickling stream flows among the boulders at the bottom of a small hill. Home to many small animals, patches of tall grass and several bushes grow around the stream.  A large willow tree is here.

Adjacent to the street lanterns, two wooden benches lay next to the cobblestone path. A fluttering yellow and orange butterfly flits back and forth amongst large lilac trees displaying their purple hues. A gentle breeze picks up the sweet scent of the purple flowers and carries it across the lane.  A colorful cobblestone path, a glowing tall wrought iron street lantern, a rosewood bench, and a flowering lilac tree are here.

Law Road from the south and Shoteron Way from the east join before turning toward Town Square to the northwest. If one stays at this location long enough, they see the irony of these two roads joining. Most who are escorted south along Law Road are the criminals and ne'er-do-wells of the Spur, while those travel along Shoteron Way are the upper class residents whom live further east. Two office building, the City Planners Office and the Archmage's office stand on opposite sides of the road, each one neatly kept and freshly painted.

Its location close to the Royale is not a coincidence. A gold-trimmed door is proof of the success of this branch of the Spurian bank and those who run it.

The elegant Hotel Royale towers above the street, its emerald door sparkling in the light. The patrons that stroll in and out are catered to, doors opened and closed for them, and baggage and packages carried by harried servants. The large Bank of Spur sits on the east side of the square. Its location close to the Royale is not a coincidence. A gold-trimmed door is proof of the success of this branch of the Spurian bank and those who run it.  An elegant gold-trimmed walnut door, open emerald steel door, and a street lantern are here.

The road between the center of town and the housing district is well kept and maintained. Ruts are immediately repaired and small bushes and flowers line the way. The class of people that travel this way are better dressed and obviously of a higher class. Occasionally guards can be seen taking criminals towards the jail in an efficient and orderly manner.  A street lantern and a pair of open wide mahogany doors are here.

A polished wooden bench sits in front of a neatly trimmed hedge. It is the perfect spot for those who wish to rest and allow their pets or children to play along the grass fronting the roadway. A small stone well complete with a dipper stands ready to slake the thirst of those who travel this way or who need a breather.  A small stone well and a street lantern are here.

A neatly trimmed hedge with a small strip of grass fronts the road that travels between the Spurian Housing District and the center of town. A well dressed Frontacian woman hurries along the path as two immaculately dressed Guards lead a criminal towards the jail. She sniffs in a haughty manner, and tips her hat down so she does not have to view the filth of the city.  A street lantern is here.

A large wagon sits on the side of the street, its load having shifted and then toppled over. A Usil driver yells at his two Oog-ra helpers, explaining to them that the armoire should be sitting upright and not on its side. They scratch themselves in confusion, and you can hear them muttering something about leaving it on its side, so it does not fall again. There will be a resident who is unhappy with their purchase this evening.  A street lantern is here.

If one stays at this location long enough, they see the irony of these two roads joining. Most who are escorted south along Law Road are the criminals and ne'er-do-wells of the Spur, while those travel along Shoteron Way are the upper class residents whom live further east. Two office building, the City Planners Office and the Archmage's office stand on opposite sides of the road, each one neatly kept and freshly painted.

Several majestic willow trees, with their long drooping branches, stand at the top of a gently sloping hill.

The garden is surrounded by a non-symmetrical stone wall done in earthen shades, yellow roses and wild vines clinging to its stony face. A small mosaic just barely peeking out from the mass of flowers and leaves can be viewed as the sun rises. In the midst of it all, a large willow tree spreads its massive branches over the area, colorful paper lanterns hanging within. A lush blanket of natural carpet, deep green clover spouting from the ground to form a soft pathway. The edge of the pond reaches to the edge of the path, the beginning of a breathtaking garden starting here. In the distance the calls of ducks and other wildlife can be heard. From one of the tallest tree branches, the echoing hum of busy bees sound from a golden beehive, the scent of honey filling the air with a delightful aroma.  An earthen stone wall mosaic and an open vine entwined silver gate are here.

Cheerful laughter can be heard echoing through this open air garden as wisps of bright colors flash past. Secians run and play a game of mid-flight tag, merrily flying past one another as their rainbow wings become a blur. Gray flecked white marble benches line a small, deep blue pool filled with cool, tranquil waters with the exception of a stray duck making a crash-landing. Various sorts of flowers from every imaginable part of Aradath sprout in full bloom in all areas, nearly overtaking the pathway. A red rosebush stands out in particular, well kept, the flowers bloom brilliantly opening to the sun. The scent of delicate floral mixed with fresh grass and tall, green leafed trees makes for an intoxicatingly fresh aroma.  A red rosebush is here.

A smooth gray marble floor flecked with white spreads out beneath you. A constant, calming sound of trickling water can be heard from a small matching marble fountain in the center. The fresh water trickles down from the three-tiered fountain spreading over little black and white pebbles in the basin. Pillows of bright colors, large and small, line the corner of the room, providing an inviting place for conversations and relaxation. A winding staircase with a thick wrought iron railing wraps its way upwards, only to grow hazy with wisps of mist as it reaches the ceiling. A few carved marble benches line the fountain for those that wish to sit next to it, the feet of the seating resembling that of a clawed Dragon. Affixed to one of the walls is a small plaque made of a blackened silvery-gray metal.

Only two walls remain of this once large room. A few stray blades of grass protrude through the stone floor, sprouting between the cracks. You can still make out what was once a glorious mosaic, depicting a fluffy white cloud puffing a breath of swirled white and sapphire wind. A warm breeze flows through the area, and whispers through the four supportive blue sapphire pillars holding aloft a highly polished dome roof. A few cracks in the silver dome allow rays of warm sunlight to enter, creating chaotic patterns on the floor as the sun moves throughout the day. Suddenly a myriad of bubbles surround you, dancing through the air entering from cracks within the wall. The bubbles pop as they touch any furniture or person and vanish from sight. Soft feather stuffed white and blue silk pillows lay in groups around the room, surprisingly untouched from the elements and popping bubbles.  A pile of blue and white feathered pillows is here.

Overhead, the canopy of deep green leaves allows for only a little bit of sun to shine through, dappling the area in patches light. The dark brown trees seem ancient and impossibly huge. Vines climb across their branches, connecting each to the next. Lush vegetation grows around their bases; broad leafed ferns, and tropical flowers. A few rare copper tinted flowers sprout near the tallest of the dark trees. Bright jewel colored hummingbirds dart around cheerfully, not seeming to mind any noise or visitors. The roots of the largest tree in the center of the grove form a small depression, filled with the blue green waters accumulated during rainfall. Small stone benches rest in the nooks of the roots around the pool. Copper basins next to them are filled with refreshments.  A majestic willow tree and an ancient tarnished copper basin are here.

A few fan-tailed fish swim through the underground pool and fade away from sight to some unknown area. A gentle breeze blows through the room at sporadic times, refreshing and soothing.

Upon entering this pitch black painted circular room it is difficult to find your bearings at first. Much darker in hue than the rest of the areas, the decor has been styled to represent a midnight sky.  An ebony archway barely visible rests on the far wall, magick surrounding it, preventing visibility into the area on the other side. Astonishing platinum stars inlaid into the ceiling flicker in the low pillar candle light.  Magickal platinum flamed candles made of deep black beeswax rest upon small round ebony tables.  Light fluffy pillows shaped to resemble clouds are stacked in three corners, dark blue and indigo in shade.  A few warm fleece blankets are stacked upon a black marble shelf carved into the wall, allowing visitors to keep warm even on the coldest of nights.  A winding wrought iron railed staircase, a closed smooth black marble box dotted with stars, and a smooth ebony archway are here.

Bright light fills this room at all times of day, reminding of pure, natural sunlight.  The rays of illumination have a brassy tint to them, creating a warm hued glow upon the simple furniture of this open-air room. Only one wall stands here, a divider to some unseen area; covered in brilliant emerald vines, splitting and taking over through cracks and niches. A single dark green vine appears sturdy enough to climb. A handmade bronze sun rests upon the wall, attached at the rough hammered points, only barely visible through the vines. Furniture built of bronze and brass center around a small pond within the center of the room. Hardly deep, a few metallic-hued fish can be seen through the emerald greenish mossy waters. When night turns to day, the bronze sun glows momentarily as a pale blue mist comes from within it, creating a magickal faux sky overhead resembling that of noon time; slowly it fades away as the day truly changes and the stars outside fade from few.  A deep crack in the wall and a smooth ebony archway are here.

Mysterious mists form the barrier around this strange garden. Nothing can be seen of the route you took to get here. Giant sized flowers bloom all around you, each one a different color and shade. A lush carpet of jewel green grass cushions your feet. The call of exotic birds echo through the air. Breaking through the path of flowers you come upon a small clump of peach trees. Luscious fruits hang from their drooping branches. Some have already been plucked and placed in a large straw basket. At the center of the stand of trees is spread a large quilted blanket. Upon closer examination of the quilt you notice each square shows a different stage of being in the life of a dragon. Quiet descends around you, filling the area with a sense of peace.  A long vine, an open deep ribboned picnic basket, and a large multicolored quilted blanket are here.

[Day.]

Bright light fills this room at all times of day, reminding of pure, natural sunlight.  The rays of illumination have a brassy tint to them, creating a warm hued glow upon the simple furniture of this open-air room. Only one wall stands here, a divider to some unseen area; covered in brilliant emerald vines, splitting and taking over through cracks and niches. A single dark green vine appears sturdy enough to climb. A handmade bronze sun rests upon the wall, attached at the rough hammered points, only barely visible through the vines. Furniture built of bronze and brass center around a small pond within the center of the room. Hardly deep, a few metallic-hued fish can be seen through the emerald greenish mossy waters. When night turns to day, the bronze sun glows momentarily as a pale blue mist comes from within it, creating a magickal faux sky overhead resembling that of noon time; slowly it fades away as the day truly changes and the stars outside fade from few.  A deep crack in the wall and a smooth ebony archway are here.

[Night.]

Upon entering this pitch black painted circular room it is difficult to find your bearings at first. Much darker in hue than the rest of the areas, the decor has been styled to represent a midnight sky.  An ebony archway barely visible rests on the far wall, magick surrounding it, preventing visibility into the area on the other side. Astonishing platinum stars inlaid into the ceiling flicker in the low pillar candle light.  Magickal platinum flamed candles made of deep black beeswax rest upon small round ebony tables.  Light fluffy pillows shaped to resemble clouds are stacked in three corners, dark blue and indigo in shade.  A few warm fleece blankets are stacked upon a black marble shelf carved into the wall, allowing visitors to keep warm even on the coldest of nights.  A winding wrought iron railed staircase, a closed smooth black marble box dotted with stars, and a smooth ebony archway are here.

A smooth gray marble floor flecked with white spreads out beneath you. A constant, calming sound of trickling water can be heard from a small matching marble fountain in the center. The fresh water trickles down from the three-tiered fountain spreading over little black and white pebbles in the basin. Pillows of bright colors, large and small, line the corner of the room, providing an inviting place for conversations and relaxation. A winding staircase with a thick wrought iron railing wraps its way upwards, only to grow hazy with wisps of mist as it reaches the ceiling. A few carved marble benches line the fountain for those that wish to sit next to it, the feet of the seating resembling that of a clawed Dragon. Affixed to one of the walls is a small plaque made of a blackened silvery-gray metal.  A blackened silver-trimmed plaque, a tall flowing marble fountain, and a mist covered cobblestone pathway are here.

[Pathway Garden.]

Cheerful laughter can be heard echoing through this open air garden as wisps of bright colors flash past. Secians run and play a game of mid-flight tag, merrily flying past one another as their rainbow wings become a blur. Gray flecked white marble benches line a small, deep blue pool filled with cool, tranquil waters with the exception of a stray duck making a crash-landing. Various sorts of flowers from every imaginable part of Aradath sprout in full bloom in all areas, nearly overtaking the pathway. A red rosebush stands out in particular, well kept, the flowers bloom brilliantly opening to the sun. The scent of delicate floral mixed with fresh grass and tall, green leafed trees makes for an intoxicatingly fresh aroma.  A red rosebush and a mist covered cobblestone pathway are here.

The garden is surrounded by a non-symmetrical stone wall done in earthen shades, yellow roses and wild vines clinging to its stony face. A small mosaic just barely peeking out from the mass of flowers and leaves can be viewed as the sun rises. In the midst of it all, a large willow tree spreads its massive branches over the area, colorful paper lanterns hanging within. A lush blanket of natural carpet, deep green clover spouting from the ground to form a soft pathway. The edge of the pond reaches to the edge of the path, the beginning of a breathtaking garden starting here. In the distance the calls of ducks and other wildlife can be heard. From one of the tallest tree branches, the echoing hum of busy bees sound from a golden beehive, the scent of honey filling the air with a delightful aroma.  An earthen stone wall mosaic and a closed vine entwined silver gate are here.

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway.

Merchant Walk comes to an abrupt end at a massive moonsilver gate. The towering walls of Spur on either side of the gates force all to pass by the guards who are constantly on the watch for thieves and bandits. Just beyond the gates one can glimpse the bustling Merchant District of Spur.  A gilded oak sign and a street lantern are here.

>[Trade Way.]

A large gate separates the Merchant District and Town Square-the hub of Spur's activity. The partially opened gate is currently able to accommodate the simultaneous passage of several locals and visitors, but can be expanded to accept carriages, or sealed to ward against invasion.  Guards stand sentry from atop the wall as well as the ground.  A street lantern is here.

Many townsfolk pass along this busy thoroughfare. Rich and poor alike mix freely on this street, much to the dismay of a passing nobleman. A young human struggles with an armful of packages and two young children in tow. Those in need of goods or supplies head west towards the market, those looking for the news of the day head east towards Town Square.  A street lantern is here.

[Trade Way & Bazaar Path.]

A path to the north winds its way among various stalls and tents. Some specialty outlets can be found, provided one does not get lost in this maze known as the Bazaar. More permanent structures to the south suggest finer goods as well as increased security.  A street lantern is here.

[Trade Way.]

This well-worn road separates the Bazaar to the north and Market Circle to the south. Only a Thugian could appreciate the layered odors of simmering foodstuffs and shoppers from the Bazaar. Crowds of people push past, some brushing against you. It might be a good idea to keep an eye on your coinpurse.  A street lantern is here.

[Trade & Market.]

The buildings of Market Circle stand to the south. It becomes obvious that the area through the arch is a much cleaner marketplace than the bazaar. An inviting eatery stands beside the road, its door open to those weary after a long trip to Spur, as well as those preparing to venture to the great expanses beyond the west gate. A human couple exit the building, arm in arm. A small sign stands beside the intersection.  A sign, an open glossy lacquered oak door, and a street lantern are here.

[Market Circle.]

An arch between two large buildings connects Market Circle and Market Street. The more reputable shopkeepers do business within the circle, but pay higher taxes for the privilege. The buildings have been built to last, as these merchants are no traveling tinkers. Interlocking stone walkways and colorful plantings span this central area. Despite the number of animals waiting outside the bank for their owners, the area is spotless. Loud chatter in many languages can be heard from the southwest.  A marble archway, an open elegant gold-trimmed walnut door, and a wooden sign are here.

Situated between the well-traveled Trade Way to the north and the fine shops of Market Circle to the south, this small stretch of road is busy at all times of day. Adventurers with sacks of plundered goods leave Market Street and head west. A shrewd businessman has set up shop in this busy area of the Market District.  A street lantern is here.

[Trade & Market.]

The buildings of Market Circle stand to the south. It becomes obvious that the area through the arch is a much cleaner marketplace than the bazaar. An inviting eatery stands beside the road, its door open to those weary after a long trip to Spur, as well as those preparing to venture to the great expanses beyond the west gate. A human couple exit the building, arm in arm. A small sign stands beside the intersection.  A sign, an open glossy lacquered oak door, and a street lantern are here.

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.   A flowing white marble fountain, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a cracked marble statue of a Human, a carved marble statue of a Dragon, a rosewood sign, some flaming ruby ashes, and a deep fluffy snow drift are here.

[Town Square.]

The elegant Hotel Royale towers above the street, its emerald door sparkling in the light. The patrons that stroll in and out are catered to, doors opened and closed for them, and baggage and packages carried by harried servants. The large Bank of Spur sits on the east side of the square. Its location close to the Royale is not a coincidence. A gold-trimmed door is proof of the success of this branch of the Spurian bank and those who run it.  An elegant gold-trimmed walnut door, open emerald steel door, and a street lantern are here.

The outward appearance of the people here seems a bit classier. Rich clothing and large coin purses are prevalent amongst the travelers. In fact, many of the folk heading into Town Square from the south are accompanied by large bodyguards to assure their safety. The well maintained road is lined with small brass lanterns, each swinging off an individual pole. No expense has been spared to keep those who travel this road safe from the hoodlums that relish the darkness.  A street lantern and some charred foliage are here.

Before you stands a magnificent white marble temple dedicated to Odarous, the god of chivalry. Ten giant steps made of the same gleaming marble lead up to the temple entrance. Two large statues stand at the base of the stairs, also carved of breath-taking marble. One is a warrior bearing a massive sword and a large shield. The other is a cleric with an amulet bearing the mark of Odarous in one hand and a large mace in the other.

The old temple that was here has been refurbished and now has a broad banner exclaiming "Gruggle's Emporium!"  Blue and red streamers cascade down from the pillars and a broad red carpet covers the steps of the building. Strange noises emanate from the interior of Gruggle's place. His ability to capture and tame even the most wild of animals is world renowned. The fact that many give wide berth around his doorway convinces any casual observer that Spurians are still not very confident in his capabilities.

A long-bearded Hithual carefully directs an eclectic group of workers in the building of a new shop. His calm voice points out those errors that would keep this building from being up to his high standards. Quality must be assured by this stout architect.

Small stepping stones bisect the yard leading you to a grand door bearing the signature "Crossed Swords." Traffic is heavy along this portion of Rehas Way. Even though it is a rare occurrence to find Sigrid or her Uncle Reyranald in attendance, when they are the line can quickly build around the block for a chance to purchase a weapon from them.

City guards lean over the walls above watching all who pass into the area. Some are stationed to help protect the interests of the traveling merchants, others to keep an eye on rogues. A large open area stands between the western Spurian Wall and Milene's Outpost. Deep ruts mar the ground, made from the traveling merchant wagons that are known to frequent this area. Whether they park for the evening or for a week, their goods are highly sought after.

Caylith cuddles with the archway.

Kiralyn says in Secian, "This is the shortcut back to Market Circle."

Caylith grunts at the archway.

Kiralyn giggles at Caylith.

[Wall Road.]

Shadowed by the wall that surrounds the city, this dark corner sees little traffic. Most Spurians access Rehas Way from Town Square, rather than through this arch. A thin sapling reaches valiantly for a sliver of sunlight. A drowsy guard on the wall above snaps to attention as his Captain approaches.  An archway is here.

This area is illuminated.
You see the 1st eagle (wearing a small gold collar).
In the area are Kiralyn the Secian, Caylith the Drake, Jessia the Novice Secian, and Emberlyn the Novice Secian.

[Wall Road.]

Livestock pace nervously in an enclosure beside the road. Chickens and other fowl peck at the ground in a vain attempt to find some food. A large sow wallows in the mud at the back of the pen, adding to the smell. A few sheep are being herded towards the gate, unaware of the fate that awaits them.  A gateway is here.

[Wall Road.]

Wall road is rife with hoofprints and tracks from wagon wheels leading to a large enclosure to the south. To those with two legs, the footing is somewhat difficult. The rear entrances to the stores of Market Circle stand just east of the road, allowing the delivery of goods. Guards peer down from above as farmers herd animals to market.

Huge blocks make up the massive wall beside you. This structure is Spur's number one defense against attack. Rising above the treetops of the woods beyond, it allows the guards to see far into the distance.

[Gateway.]

The relative safety inside Spur is a comfort to those returning from the fields and mountains. To those leaving, a massive wall of defense around the city lies ahead. Archer towers beside the gate overlook the wall, offering a painful welcome to would-be invaders. Several guards on foot patrol pass and disappear behind a thick, bluesteel banded steelwood door. Wall road stretches to the south, a wide passage between the city wall and several large buildings.  An open iron gate, an open thick stone door, and a street lantern are here.

[Spur Gateway.]

Travelers from Rathan to the northwest, and the Trade Route to the south, converge at Spur's west gate. Guards posted on the ground give those seeking to enter the city a cursory once-over. Their lack of interest shows that anyone approaching has already been observed from above for some time. A grate in the ground loosens mud from wagon wheels and hooves before they pass through the gate, helping to keep the streets of Spur fairly clean.  An open giant black iron gate, a giant green oak tree, a small blue pool, a thick oak grate over the pool, and a polished stone marker are here.

[Trade Way.]

From the city gate to the west, Trade Way continues eastward towards the busy Merchant district, past Joyeusse's Shop. The air is thick with the scent of fresh flowers. Wagons filled with goods bound for sale trundle past, their drivers hopeful of the anticipated profits. Eager young warriors venture towards the west gate and the dangers beyond.  An open carved rosewood door and a street lantern are here.

[Trade Way.]

Deep grey mists surround a strange pile of rubble that lies south of the road. Occasionally a priest clad in a simple grey robe will wander past the rubble and whisper a short prayer under his breath. The fence running around the rubble is well kept, but the gate which once allowed entrance to this Temple has been chained closed.  A grey iron chained gate, a pile of rubble, and a street lantern are here.

This area is illuminated.
You see the 1st city guard mage, the 2nd city guard mage, the 1st ork, and the 1st eagle (wearing a small gold collar).

[Trade Way.]

The throngs of travelers thicken as one heads east along Trade Way. An Anthian plays softly on a strange looking stringed instrument, her melodic voice filling the air. Judging by her clothing, and the number of silvers at her feet, she makes a fine living practicing her craft.  A street lantern is here.

[Trade & Market.]

The buildings of Market Circle stand to the south. It becomes obvious that the area through the arch is a much cleaner marketplace than the bazaar. An inviting eatery stands beside the road, its door open to those weary after a long trip to Spur, as well as those preparing to venture to the great expanses beyond the west gate. A human couple exit the building, arm in arm. A small sign stands beside the intersection.  A sign, an open glossy lacquered oak door, and a street lantern are here.

[Market Street.]

Situated between the well-traveled Trade Way to the north and the fine shops of Market Circle to the south, this small stretch of road is busy at all times of day. Adventurers with sacks of plundered goods leave Market Street and head west. A shrewd businessman has set up shop in this busy area of the Market District.  A street lantern is here.

Market Street ends here at a large archway. People bustle in and out of the arch, some without so much as a nod. The city wall rises up to the south and west of the buildings of Market Circle. A small sign is posted on the wall beside the archway.  A street lantern is here.

[Market Circle.]

An arch between two large buildings connects Market Circle and Market Street. The more reputable shopkeepers do business within the circle, but pay higher taxes for the privilege. The buildings have been built to last, as these merchants are no traveling tinkers. Interlocking stone walkways and colorful plantings span this central area. Despite the number of animals waiting outside the bank for their owners, the area is spotless. Loud chatter in many languages can be heard from the southwest.  A marble archway, an open elegant gold-trimmed walnut door, and a wooden sign are here.

The muffled noises you hear drifting in from the west come out of the Bazaar itself, a veritable hive of activity day and night. An occasion exotic smell is carried by the breeze to tantalize the nose. A large etched window displays tastefully dressed mannequins of many races.  An open sturdy mahogany door and a street lantern are here.

Further passage along Bazaar Path is blocked occasionally by brawling peasants. Fights break out over who got here first, who gets to sell first, whose goods are better and who should just pack up and leave. When guards are forced to leave their posts to settle the arguments, all involved lose.  A street lantern is here.

Many people crowd the narrow Bazaar Path, either heading towards the infamous Bazaar, or forcing their way back towards Trade Way. For a small price, a farmer can rent a booth and directly market his goods. Both some of the best and some of the worst deals can be made within this collection of stalls. The tall wall of Spur looms high to the east, and many of the guards take an early peek into the carts and the goods coming to market.  A street lantern is here.

The buildings of Market Circle stand to the south. It becomes obvious that the area through the arch is a much cleaner marketplace than the bazaar. An inviting eatery stands beside the road, its door open to those weary after a long trip to Spur, as well as those preparing to venture to the great expanses beyond the west gate. A human couple exit the building, arm in arm. A small sign stands beside the intersection.  A sign, an open glossy lacquered oak door, and a street lantern are here.

[Market Circle.]

An arch between two large buildings connects Market Circle and Market Street. The more reputable shopkeepers do business within the circle, but pay higher taxes for the privilege. The buildings have been built to last, as these merchants are no traveling tinkers. Interlocking stone walkways and colorful plantings span this central area. Despite the number of animals waiting outside the bank for their owners, the area is spotless. Loud chatter in many languages can be heard from the southwest.  A marble archway, an open elegant gold-trimmed walnut door, and a wooden sign are here.

Brilliant streamers hang festooned in deep swaths of velvet and bright multicolored bolts of silk over pearly white walls. Two circular glass enclosures rise some eight spans toward the ceiling on either side of the grand doors. Gentle tinkling music plays in the background as, within the cases, stunning garments of all types are lifted softly into magickal animation.

Gentle tinkling music plays in the background as, within the cases, stunning garments of all types are lifted softly into magickal animation.

The buildings have been built to last, as these merchants are no traveling tinkers. Interlocking stone walkways and colorful plantings span this central area. Despite the number of animals waiting outside the bank for their owners, the area is spotless. Loud chatter in many languages can be heard from the southwest.

The buildings of Market Circle stand to the south. It becomes obvious that the area through the arch is a much cleaner marketplace than the bazaar. An inviting eatery stands beside the road, its door open to those weary after a long trip to Spur, as well as those preparing to venture to the great expanses beyond the west gate. A human couple exit the building, arm in arm. A small sign stands beside the intersection.  A sign, an open glossy lacquered oak door, and a street lantern are here.

Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.   A flowing white marble fountain, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a cracked marble statue of a Human, a carved marble statue of a Dragon, a rosewood sign, some flaming ruby ashes, and a deep fluffy snow drift are here.

No expense has been spared to keep those who travel this road safe from the hoodlums that relish the darkness.  A street lantern and some charred foliage are here.

The boughs of a large apple tree hang over the well tended avenue. Below the beautiful tree stands a small fountain. Atop the fountain is an intricately carved Secian who appears to be dancing with the water as it splashes around her.

An elegant, carved wooden sign hangs above the ornate gateway set into the massive wall that divides Spurs Noble District from the Town Square. You can make out city guardsmen peering down attentively at all that approach from their posts atop the imposing wall. They seem to take a greater interest in this part of town, though there does not seem to be anything threatening enough here to warrant such attention.  A gilded silver plaque and a street lantern are here.

An unusually large home, even for this part of town, lies off to the west. It seems as if one ambitious owner is slowly buying up the lots next to his and adding them to his own. Groundskeepers are at work in the surrounding gardens, trimming and raking, so intent on their work they do not bother to acknowledge the passing traffic on the road.  A street lantern is here.

Noble Way continues to wind its way among the rather modestly sized, but elegant, homes of the Spur's successful. Many a peasant farmer may live in homes larger than these, but none can match the quality found here. A peaceful, luxurious feeling pervades this part of town; perhaps it is the drifting floral scents wafting from the well-tended gardens.

Gazing down each of the nearby private drives reveals a glimpse of a luxurious home, each a miniature estate in its own right. Short, stout walls and manicured hedges serve to keep out the riffraff and to protect the small, expensive gardens.

The homes display a slightly different style, perhaps they are not quite so restrained; a touch more exuberance and freedom with materials is displayed.  A street lantern is here.

Occasional gates and driveways lead back into the well-kept estates of the city's nobility, breaking and adding interest to the defining plane of the walls lining Noble Way.

A small roadway bordered by flowering hedges bisects the wide avenue of Noble Way at a right angle, heading east to west.  A thick, sturdy sign stands just off to the side of a charming path, its large friendly letters intent on luring travelers into the city's premiere roadstay, the Gilded Lion Inn.

Majestic elms continue to line this broad roadway, sheltering the avenue on both sides and further enhancing the grandiose atmosphere. Fronting the beautiful homes, cobbled paths edged with narrow flower beds meander through nearby private gardens. Though they appear wonderful places to spend an afternoon or take a picnic, the glances from those tending the estates makes it clear they are only for the invited.  A street lantern is here.

The occasional locked gate marks the entrance to some of the more hidden estates of Spurs nobility. From this broad avenue, little can be seen of their splendor. Behind the imposing gate recedes a proud drive, disappearing mysteriously into the trees. If not for the large imposing tower rising above the hedges it would be hard to discern anything was beyond the gate. It is apparent the residents do not wish to be disturbed.  A street lantern, a closed morbius door, and an open black iron gate are here.

A well-guarded gateway separates the city's residential district from the farmlands just beyond. Guards carefully eye all that enter or exit the city, beckoning gruffly to random travelers for a closer inspection. The structure of the guards' barracks is visible above the road to the west. A weathered wooden sign is posted by the gate.  An open stone gate, a wooden sign, an open thick stone door, and a street lantern are here.

[South gate.]

Through the gate lies the city of Spur, the major center of trade and civilization on the plains. The dusty road leading through the gates is well traveled, and walls of the city are in good repair. A small shack sits to the west of the road, during most times of the day a dusty coach can be seen waiting in front, its horses stomping with impatience to be gone. To the right of the door is a small window, its opening covered with metal bars. An old man, missing most of his teeth, waits patiently for the travelers to pay their fare, and then directs them into the waiting area. On the east side of the road a billowing multicolored tent has been erected, the hustle and bustle of merchants and customers can be seen coming and going at all times of the day.  A rainbow silk tent and an open iron gate are here.

Goods from the four corners of the world are offered for sale. In the corner draped with beautiful multicolored silks, a small booth has been erected.  A multicolored draped silk booth, an exit, an open reed picnic basket, an open reed picnic basket, an open reed picnic basket, and an open reed picnic basket are here.

>[South gate.]

Through the gate lies the city of Spur, the major center of trade and civilization on the plains. The dusty road leading through the gates is well traveled, and walls of the city are in good repair. A small shack sits to the west of the road, during most times of the day a dusty coach can be seen waiting in front, its horses stomping with impatience to be gone. To the right of the door is a small window, its opening covered with metal bars. An old man, missing most of his teeth, waits patiently for the travelers to pay their fare, and then directs them into the waiting area. On the east side of the road a billowing multicolored tent has been erected, the hustle and bustle of merchants and customers can be seen coming and going at all times of the day.  A rainbow silk tent and an open iron gate are here.

A well-guarded gateway separates the city's residential district from the farmlands just beyond. Guards carefully eye all that enter or exit the city, beckoning gruffly to random travelers for a closer inspection. The structure of the guards' barracks is visible above the road to the west. A weathered wooden sign is posted by the gate.  An open stone gate, a wooden sign, an open thick stone door, and a street lantern are here.

The occasional locked gate marks the entrance to some of the more hidden estates of Spurs nobility. From this broad avenue, little can be seen of their splendor. Behind the imposing gate recedes a proud drive, disappearing mysteriously into the trees. If not for the large imposing tower rising above the hedges it would be hard to discern anything was beyond the gate. It is apparent the residents do not wish to be disturbed.  A street lantern, a closed morbius door, and an open black iron gate are here.

Majestic elms continue to line this broad roadway, sheltering the avenue on both sides and further enhancing the grandiose atmosphere. Fronting the beautiful homes, cobbled paths edged with narrow flower beds meander through nearby private gardens. Though they appear wonderful places to spend an afternoon or take a picnic, the glances from those tending the estates makes it clear they are only for the invited.  A street lantern is here.

A small roadway bordered by flowering hedges bisects the wide avenue of Noble Way at a right angle, heading east to west.  A thick, sturdy sign stands just off to the side of a charming path, its large friendly letters intent on luring travelers into the city's premiere roadstay, the Gilded Lion Inn. The entrance is clearly marked and welcoming, extending off to the southeast.  A wooden sign and a street lantern are here.

Occasional gates and driveways lead back into the well-kept estates of the city's nobility, breaking and adding interest to the defining plane of the walls lining Noble Way.

Numerous trees lining the avenue serve as the dividing border between the majestic estates of the nobility and the lightly traveled roadway.

The entire avenue is composed of fine cobblestone, each level with its neighbor, providing a smooth ride for passing carriages and horses.

Leaving the exceptionally wealthy estates of the Spurian nobility, Noble Way heads toward the Town Square to the northwest. Along the roadside can be seen the in-city homes of successful merchants and other wealthy citizens of the Spur. The homes display a slightly different style, perhaps they are not quite so restrained; a touch more exuberance and freedom with materials is displayed.  A street lantern is here.

Gazing down each of the nearby private drives reveals a glimpse of a luxurious home, each a miniature estate in its own right. Short, stout walls and manicured hedges serve to keep out the riffraff and to protect the small, expensive gardens.

Noble Way continues to wind its way among the rather modestly sized, but elegant, homes of the Spur's successful. Many a peasant farmer may live in homes larger than these, but none can match the quality found here. A peaceful, luxurious feeling pervades this part of town; perhaps it is the drifting floral scents wafting from the well-tended gardens.

The boughs of a large apple tree hang over the well tended avenue. Below the beautiful tree stands a small fountain. Atop the fountain is an intricately carved Secian who appears to be dancing with the water as it splashes around her. Set in the marble base is a small plaque that reads, "For those who have gone before us." Many stand for a moment as they pass this way, giving thanks for the gift of life that is given by both the apple tree and the Secians of long ago. Large piles of dirt and broken stone lay on either side of the street as workmen ready the east and west alleys for expansion.  A street lantern, a Secian etched moonsilver door, a pair of open silver forged swinging doors, and a sign above the doors are here.

Vast estates tower over the huge Spurian wall towards the south. The well-to-do who live in these homes idle away their days, enjoying the luxury of time.

In fact, many of the folk heading into Town Square from the south are accompanied by large bodyguards to assure their safety. The well maintained road is lined with small brass lanterns, each swinging off an individual pole. No expense has been spared to keep those who travel this road safe from the hoodlums that relish the darkness.  A street lantern and some charred foliage are here.

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.   A flowing white marble fountain, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a cracked marble statue of a Human, a carved marble statue of a Dragon, a rosewood sign, some flaming ruby ashes, a deep fluffy snow drift, and a worn leather money belt are here.

Guards stand sentry from atop the wall as well as the ground.  A street lantern is here.

[Merchant Walk.]

Merchant Walk comes to an abrupt end at a massive moonsilver gate. The towering walls of Spur on either side of the gates force all to pass by the guards who are constantly on the watch for thieves and bandits. Just beyond the gates one can glimpse the bustling Merchant District of Spur.  A gilded oak sign and a street lantern are here.

Several city guardsmen have just finished wrestling to the ground some young tough thieves, who thought to rob one of the returning merchants. To one side a relieved-looking Fir Elf gentleman holds on tightly to his gold-tipped walking stick, as the human boy yells his innocence to any who might listen. His pleas fall on deaf ears as the guards drag him away.  A street lantern is here.

Merchants, some in frilly finery, others dressed in homespun wools, travel back and forth along this street on their way to and from work. They seem to blend together here, if only briefly. Several of the more haughty looking merchants are trailed by overloaded carts pushed along by haggard young apprentices.   A street lantern is here.

A neatly kept park fronts this portion of Merchant Walk. Topiary and low shrubberies partition off small sections of the park. Young lovers sit on benches almost hidden from view, gazing at each other with looks of love, oblivious to the continual bustle of passing customers and merchants on their way to do business.  A street lantern is here.

[Town Square West.]

People carrying bundles stream in from the west and rapidly lose themselves in the large crowds moving about in the vast town square. Several citizens head west with bulging coinpurses babbling excitedly about what they're going to purchase. Giggling children dart around the slower moving folks rushing on their way to spend the silvers in their pockets.  A street lantern is here.

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.   A flowing white marble fountain, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a cracked marble statue of a Human, a carved marble statue of a Dragon, a rosewood sign, some flaming ruby ashes, a deep fluffy snow drift, and a worn leather money belt are here.

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.   A flowing white marble fountain, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a cracked marble statue of a Human, a carved marble statue of a Dragon, a rosewood sign, some flaming ruby ashes, a deep fluffy snow drift, and a worn leather money belt are here.

A large wagon sits on the side of the street, its load having shifted and then toppled over. A Usil driver yells at his two Oog-ra helpers, explaining to them that the armoire should be sitting upright and not on its side. They scratch themselves in confusion, and you can hear them muttering something about leaving it on its side, so it does not fall again. There will be a resident who is unhappy with their purchase this evening.  A street lantern is here.

Right Street ends at a gateway leading to the Housing and Administration District. Those living in this portion of town travel comfortably either by conveyance or by foot. Beautiful flowers grow on both sides of the well tended, freshly painted gate. In front, standing crisply at attention, a Guard tips his hat in greeting to all those who pass.  An open iron gate and a street lantern are here.

Most who are escorted south along Law Road are the criminals and ne'er-do-wells of the Spur, while those travel along Shoteron Way are the upper class residents whom live further east. Two office building, the City Planners Office and the Archmage's office stand on opposite sides of the road, each one neatly kept and freshly painted.  A street lantern and an open morbius door are here.

The colorful city and its multitude of citizens seem to have vanished. The drab, grim grey walls of the buildings that line Law Road are the only things to greet those who travel this cobblestone street. City guards head in both directions, most escorting prisoners to their final destinations in the city jail. The city's clocktower can be seen to the south.  A street lantern, an open neatly painted oak door, and a lettered brass sign above the door are here.

Two tall pines stand sentinel on either side of the small white stone lane. A neatly manicured lawn rides up against a smooth stone wall on both the southern and northern property line. The white road is made up of identically sized white stones that are so perfectly fitted together it is hard to tell that the road is not one long single piece. A single wooden bench sits under one of the larger trees, a nice place to rest and reflect.  An open large pine gate is here.

The broad expanse of lawn is dotted with pine cones and various animals. The wind blowing through the tall pine trees whistles as the mighty branches sway and dance far above. The white stone road splits as it heads towards the east, leading towards several sets of low slung bungalows. On the north side of the road a small cottage sits nestled among the trees. On the south side of the road a handsome two-story building a sign hanging on the front is carved with the single word, "Office."  A closed intricate steelwood door and a closed solid bluesteel door are here.

In front of each home is a beautiful garden, created to reflect the personality of those who live within. A well manicured courtyard sits in front of the homes dotted with smaller pines and benches. Small rabbits hop along unmolested nibbling upon the lush grass.  A closed blue pine door, a closed tan pine door, a closed red pine door, and a closed white pine door are here.

Set among the large pine trees are four small white bungalows. Each with a uniquely colored door. They are set in an "L" shape, two of them north of the road and two of them east, a mirror reflection of the bungalows to the south. In front of each home is a beautiful garden, created to reflect the personality of those who live within. A well manicured courtyard sits in front of the homes dotted with smaller pines and benches. Small rabbits hop along unmolested nibbling upon the lush grass.  A closed blue pine door, a closed tan pine door, a closed red pine door, and a closed white pine door are here.

Forming an "L" shape, four cute white bungalows sit along the east and south edge of a large courtyard. Each home has a garden filled with lush flowers, small bushes and miniature trees, surrounded by a white picket fence. The doors of the little bungalows are all different colors, as if to match the personality of the owner. The lush lawn that spreads out to the north and another matching set of homes is dotted with smaller pine trees, pine cones littering the ground and occasionally squirrels popping their head out of their homes to take in the scenery.  A closed grey pine door, a closed pale yellow pine door, a closed brown pine door, and a closed deep crimson pine door are here.

The broad expanse of lawn is dotted with pine cones and various animals. The wind blowing through the tall pine trees whistles as the mighty branches sway and dance far above. The white stone road splits as it heads towards the east, leading towards several sets of low slung bungalows. On the north side of the road a small cottage sits nestled among the trees. On the south side of the road a handsome two-story building a sign hanging on the front is carved with the single word, "Office."  A closed intricate steelwood door and a closed solid bluesteel door are here.

Two tall pines stand sentinel on either side of the small white stone lane. A neatly manicured lawn rides up against a smooth stone wall on both the southern and northern property line. The white road is made up of identically sized white stones that are so perfectly fitted together it is hard to tell that the road is not one long single piece. A single wooden bench sits under one of the larger trees, a nice place to rest and reflect.  A closed large pine gate is here.

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.   A flowing white marble fountain, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a cracked marble statue of a Human, a carved marble statue of a Dragon, a rosewood sign, some flaming ruby ashes, a deep fluffy snow drift, a worn leather money belt, a cracked vial of swamp gas, a flagon of spiced Silverforge Dark ale, a frosted glass bottle of sailor's milk, and an enameled blue porcelain jug are here.

The elegant Hotel Royale towers above the street, its emerald door sparkling in the light. The patrons that stroll in and out are catered to, doors opened and closed for them, and baggage and packages carried by harried servants. The large Bank of Spur sits on the east side of the square. Its location close to the Royale is not a coincidence. A gold-trimmed door is proof of the success of this branch of the Spurian bank and those who run it.

A Usil driver yells at his two Oog-ra helpers, explaining to them that the armoire should be sitting upright and not on its side. They scratch themselves in confusion, and you can hear them muttering something about leaving it on its side, so it does not fall again.

If one stays at this location long enough, they see the irony of these two roads joining. Most who are escorted south along Law Road are the criminals and ne'er-do-wells of the Spur, while those travel along Shoteron Way are the upper class residents whom live further east.

The broad expanse of lawn is dotted with pine cones and various animals. The wind blowing through the tall pine trees whistles as the mighty branches sway and dance far above. The white stone road splits as it heads towards the east, leading towards several sets of low slung bungalows. On the north side of the road a small cottage sits nestled among the trees.
