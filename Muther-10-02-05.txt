The chipped bark path widens to encompass a broad square between the peaked roofs of the village homes, the larger storefronts, and several communal buildings that all surround a magnificent fountain crafted from local sandstone. The multi-tiered fountain flows with pure, clean springwater and provides seating around its broad base.  The towering trees surround the village, enclosing the square in a living frame.  To the west is a sturdy building with its door perpetually ajar. A line of Leuian children trots off towards the north, bearing their lessons. The faint ding of nautical bells flows in on the breeze from the northwest.   A flowing gold-flecked sandstone fountain is here.

An immense, smoothed river boulder deposited by the river, eons ago, is imbedded in the soft loam of the forest floor and blocks the view of the river to the north. A few giant trees have grown bent around its rounded shape and an innovative homeowner has taken advantage of the resulting shelter. Built carefully among the trees in the lee of the rock, stands a magnificent example of the same peaked wooden beam homes that dot the entire forest. One fledgling tree pokes its head through a well-planned hole in the roof.  A pair of closed magnificent carved steelwood doors, a slippery downhill path, and a stack of rocks are here.

The houses grow more abundant as the path meanders further around the park. Rows of homes border the park and stretch back amongst the low hills towards the inner part of the island.

Two Leuian adolescents chat and laugh amongst themselves as they casually stroll down the path to the pier, kicking a stone between them.  Some sandy wooden steps are here.

A row of smaller cottages with tiny gardens flanks the path on the western edge of a massive river-smoothed boulder. Cheerfully painted wooden mailboxes sprout from the stone curbs, planted to overflowing with crimson poppies and dark green creeping charley vines. The peaked roofs of the small homes are no less spectacular than those of the larger dwellings. Skillful carvings cover the balustrades that support the roofs, creating beautiful, comfortable porches. The cozy homes are bustling with the busy lives of several families.

The bark path skirts the lagoon here and connects the docks to the rest of the village. A few bright wildflowers decorate the edge and dance in the light breeze. Weary sailors amble up the road after returning from a long voyage with their duffels thrown over their backs. Further down the road, the lighthouse is barely visible along the shoreline. Although difficult to see from here, its light shines like a beacon of hope to all the river. A giggling band of khits rushes towards the pier in hopes of catching a glimpse of some of the noble ships docked there. A group of Leuians sit near a few large rocks by the docks, mending nets and singing songs with one another as they wave to the returning fleets.

The thick, tarred pylons of a long wooden pier poke through the surface of the calm lagoon interrupting the flat, mirrored reflection of the wharf storefronts and dry-docked ships. Here, the wheel hits the rub where the fleets converge, merchant ships load and unload, and individuals fish or relax. There are dozens of tables for display of wares awaiting the return of the fishing fleet. Behind each table lies a workspace open to a gully below for the disposal of scraps, where gulls and terns scavenge for tasty tid-bits. Several long shoremen await the lowering of the gangplank of another vessel with empty carts and drays. The stiff breeze off the river invigorates the hustle of the wharf.

[Pier.]

Three old fishermen sit on wobbly stools in the middle of the pier discussing fishtails with one another and how they each nearly captured "Ol' Murky". The lighthouse, now clearly in view, stands proudly as the guardian of the river. The riverbottom is visible through the crystal clear water, as is an extremely large bass that has tucked itself behind one of the pilings. To the southeast, the huge trees on the shore part to show a peek of the golden sand beach.

This area is illuminated.
You see the 1st silvery timber wolf (wearing a small gold collar).

The thick, tarred pylons of a long wooden pier poke through the surface of the calm lagoon interrupting the flat, mirrored reflection of the wharf storefronts and dry-docked ships. Here, the wheel hits the rub where the fleets converge, merchant ships load and unload, and individuals fish or relax. There are dozens of tables for display of wares awaiting the return of the fishing fleet. Behind each table lies a workspace open to a gully below for the disposal of scraps, where gulls and terns scavenge for tasty tid-bits. Several long shoremen await the lowering of the gangplank of another vessel with empty carts and drays. The stiff breeze off the river invigorates the hustle of the wharf.

[End of Pier.]

The sturdy oak planks of the pier creak harmoniously with every wave and every footfall. A young Leuian sitting over to one side of the pier hums quietly as he hangs another fish on his stringer. Two redwood benches that line the thick timber rails are set perfectly to allow a more intimate view of the river and the lighthouse further downriver.  A weathered hand-carved redwood bench and a weathered hand-carved redwood bench are here.

Three old fishermen sit on wobbly stools in the middle of the pier discussing fishtails with one another and how they each nearly captured "Ol' Murky". The lighthouse, now clearly in view, stands proudly as the guardian of the river. The riverbottom is visible through the crystal clear water, as is an extremely large bass that has tucked itself behind one of the pilings. To the southeast, the huge trees on the shore part to show a peek of the golden sand beach.  A long red and yellow steelhead is here.

The thick, tarred pylons of a long wooden pier poke through the surface of the calm lagoon interrupting the flat, mirrored reflection of the wharf storefronts and dry-docked ships. Here, the wheel hits the rub where the fleets converge, merchant ships load and unload, and individuals fish or relax. There are dozens of tables for display of wares awaiting the return of the fishing fleet. Behind each table lies a workspace open to a gully below for the disposal of scraps, where gulls and terns scavenge for tasty tid-bits. Several long shoremen await the lowering of the gangplank of another vessel with empty carts and drays. The stiff breeze off the river invigorates the hustle of the wharf.

The bark path skirts the lagoon here and connects the docks to the rest of the village. A few bright wildflowers decorate the edge and dance in the light breeze. Weary sailors amble up the road after returning from a long voyage with their duffels thrown over their backs. Further down the road, the lighthouse is barely visible along the shoreline. Although difficult to see from here, its light shines like a beacon of hope to all the river. A giggling band of khits rushes towards the pier in hopes of catching a glimpse of some of the noble ships docked there. A group of Leuians sit near a few large rocks by the docks, mending nets and singing songs with one another as they wave to the returning fleets.

The tidy rows of well-tended yards lead down a slope to the edge of the island where the chipped bark path widens to accomodate the entrance to a large redwood building. The school buildling is square with a large grassy yard, perfectly situated for dozens of small Leuians to run around and practice their various drills and lessons. A tall white-furred Leuian stands just outside the main door and greets each student by name and with a respectful nod.  A large airy redwood school house is here.

Three old fishermen sit on wobbly stools in the middle of the pier discussing fishtails with one another and how they each nearly captured "Ol' Murky". The lighthouse, now clearly in view, stands proudly as the guardian of the river. The riverbottom is visible through the crystal clear water, as is an extremely large bass that has tucked itself behind one of the pilings. To the southeast, the huge trees on the shore part to show a peek of the golden sand beach.

[Village.]

The thick, tarred pylons of a long wooden pier poke through the surface of the calm lagoon interrupting the flat, mirrored reflection of the wharf storefronts and dry-docked ships. Here, the wheel hits the rub where the fleets converge, merchant ships load and unload, and individuals fish or relax. There are dozens of tables for display of wares awaiting the return of the fishing fleet. Behind each table lies a workspace open to a gully below for the disposal of scraps, where gulls and terns scavenge for tasty tid-bits. Several long shoremen await the lowering of the gangplank of another vessel with empty carts and drays. The stiff breeze off the river invigorates the hustle of the wharf.

This area is illuminated.

[Village.]

The bark path skirts the lagoon here and connects the docks to the rest of the village. A few bright wildflowers decorate the edge and dance in the light breeze. Weary sailors amble up the road after returning from a long voyage with their duffels thrown over their backs. Further down the road, the lighthouse is barely visible along the shoreline. Although difficult to see from here, its light shines like a beacon of hope to all the river. A giggling band of khits rushes towards the pier in hopes of catching a glimpse of some of the noble ships docked there. A group of Leuians sit near a few large rocks by the docks, mending nets and singing songs with one another as they wave to the returning fleets.

The houses grow more abundant as the path meanders further around the park. Rows of homes border the park and stretch back amongst the low hills towards the inner part of the island. The light is brighter here, as the canopy of trees thins to allow an expanse of sky to open directly over the middle of the village. Two Leuian adolescents chat and laugh amongst themselves as they casually stroll down the path to the pier, kicking a stone between them.  Some sandy wooden steps are here.

[Protected Cove.]

Beyond the embrace of the forest, a warm golden sand beach has gathered in the backflow of a protected cove. Above, fern fronds, vines, and the exposed roots of the giant conifers dangle over the edge of a short steppe that protects the village from floods.  A walkway created by dual rows of pitch torches lead to a large, communal sand pit. Circling the pit are several large logs evenly spaced for those who come to catch the night's events or simply sit and relax.   Some sandy wooden steps, a cool clear lagoon, a blazing crackling fire pit, a fish shaped copper platter, a finely woven reed placemat, an open linen lined reed bread basket, an open ice filled oak drink chest, a smooth pearlescent glass bowl, a copper handled reed dessert tray, and a red and white linen covered picnic table are here.

[Forest Fringe.]

Few tall trees can root in the sandy soil so near the river bank.  Scraggly waterberry bushes tenaciously hold to the shifting loam between the smoothed river boulders riddled with cracked quartz and feldspar.  An obscured path leads into the darker fringes of the forest and up the steppe to the village.
