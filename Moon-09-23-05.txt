A huge, gnarled tree presides over this small clearing in the jungle. A strange bird sits on a high branch, its wildly iridescent plumage glimmering with every bit of light that hits it. A haunting song erupts from its throat, sounding like a woman humming a forlorn song. The odor of burning wood wafts lightly through the area.

Lush greenery thrives as hovering pines stretch towards the heavenly lights. The rushing wind thrusts through the trees, carrying on its wings the fragrant scent of pine. Under the shadow of the trees, wild flowers grow in vibrant colors of crimson, black, and violet. Embraced between the trees and flowers, a roadway of flagstones has been newly constructed.  Some twinkling violet wisteria bushes and a pair of red and black striped dragonlilies are here.

The edge of the forest meets the fortress of Emjedah, which stands as an ethereal sentinel against the landscape that embraces it. Its midnight armor of black marble gleams as the decorated medals of an ornamented soldier do.

Towers and buildings topped with teardrop shaped roofs hover high above the imposing city wall. Flaming torches dot the circumference of the parapet of the city wall.

A steadfast stream of twisting rapids curls around the outer surface of the wall.

The building that once housed the Imperial Emjedah Militia now lies in a pile of rubble, one stone block with a plaque identifying it lies to the front, a huge crack down the middle of it. Larger piles of black rubble nearby are likely the remains of towers or ramparts from the battered walls. The smell of decaying corpses fills the air, and clouds of flies buzz around the blackened pools of blood and gore that cover the cobblestones.  A glowing rune etched crystal lantern, a cracked grey stone arch keystone, a broken splintered wooden guard tower door, and an open gore-splattered carved stone drawbridge are here.

Time seems to stand still in this place. Aside from an occasional furtive scrambling sound, there is little to hear. One would think these trees would be alive with birds.

Obvious paths: south* northwest*.
[Emjedah Trail]

Layers of settling organic debris make the ground beneath your feet quite soft. The path is surrounded by an amazing array of strange plants, many of which are unfamiliar.  A small winding stone path is here.

The drooping firs form a huge canopy overhead. Huge tendrils of parasitic moss hang from their branches, creating a rather unsettling effect. Even in broad daylight it's dim in this verdant tunnel.

Obvious paths: southwest* northwest*.
[Emjedah Trail]

The huge, ancient trees make the path meander a bit, but you're definitely angling northward. It was obviously easier to wind between the massive tree trunks than to attempt to cut a straight road through the forest.  An open small iron animal snare is here.

[Emjedah Trail]

This newly constructed bit of road winds ambitiously into the looming forestlands to the north. Although not terribly well defined, the road presents an intriguing alternative to your usual route.  A slightly hidden trail and an open small iron animal snare are here.
