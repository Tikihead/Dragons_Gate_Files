Vaile says, "I just wanted to throw in as an aside, Secians *can not* lie, this is not a liscence to go running around questioning other peoples RP and saying they suck, etc. because you think as a player they are lying, or you think you caught them in a lie."

Siara grins.

Siara says, "Good point."

Vaile says, "Your characters would simply assume, a Secian can never lie, it's common knowledge in the world of Aradath, calling a Secian a liar is moronic."

Tyviel'a says to Althulas, "of course, they can only relate what they know."

Althulas nods.

Althulas nods up and down.

Vaile exclaims, "They could even be joking around! Way too often I see people jump all over a Secian for "percieved" lying and take an IC situation OOC by going off about how they lied, etc."

Tyviel'a says, "Let us deal with blatant lying, if you see something that needs to be reported, email myself and or Siara. There have been a few situations that needed looking into, but let us handle it. You just worry about having fun"

Vaile says, "Really every player should be listening to this, since Secians/Dragons are probably the least of the issue here, but the bottom line is everyone knows Secians can't lie, if something weird happens IC PLEASE keep it IC and don't resort to that finger.."

Vaile says, "pointing and OOC liar-liar stuff."

Tiamat nods.

Tiamat asks, "Is it ok for a secian to look the other way in certain situations?"

Tiamat says, "the wyvern one being an example"

Tyviel'a says, "That is too broad a question, really. The wyvern situation would differ by character."

Tyviel'a says, "A Bondmate is going to stay by a Bondmate's side 99.9% of the time."

Marinda asks, "even if he's tracking someone down to kill them?"

Tyviel'a says, "I should clarify that to some extent."

Tiamat asks, "but it isnt a far stretch for a secian to see that perhaps the wyverns or anything like that may need to be gotten rid of?"

Tyviel'a says, "Hold on a sec"

Tiamat nods.

Lebelle grins at Raptorian.

Tyviel'a says, "The secian and the dragon are probably going to approach something or even most things from two different sides, at least originally."

Caylith leans her head on Raptorian's shoulder.

Kiralyn blinks.

Caylith comforts Raptorian.

Raptorian says to Kiralyn, "She said "boo""

Lebelle exclaims, "Shhhh!"

Kiralyn comforts Raptorian.

Tyviel'a asks, "The wyverns being a good example. Would a secian purposely tell a dragon of wyvern agression nearby? That is a tough call, knowing what the dragon is probably going to do. But that is one I am not going to tell you exactly what to do."

Althulas nods slowly.

Tiamat nods.

Tyviel'a says to Tiamat, "and no, I do not think a secian would admit the only way to handle the wyverns is to kill them all."

Kiralyn flails her arms about wildly at Syl.

Kiralyn faints dead away.

Lebelle blinks.

Kiralyn regains consciousness.

Kiralyn sits up.

Kiralyn listens intently to Tyviel'a.

Kiralyn hums.

Tyviel'a says, "Back to what I said about Bondmates."

Raptorian leans on Lebelle.

Tyviel'a says, "I do not want to see that appear in some post, so let me try to clear it up."

Tyviel'a grins.

Darrow listens intently to Tyviel'a.

Mahtina winks at Tyviel'a.

Tyviel'a says, "It is up to you specifically how your Bondmate would react, that character. But when push comes to shove, most of the time a Bondmate is going to be at a Bondmate's side."

Tyviel'a winks at Mahtina.

Darrow nods slowly.

Equality stands up.
You must be standing or crawling to follow any further.

Equality, dragging a massive war hammer behind himself, just went through an open wooden door.

Tyviel'a says, "The Bond does work both ways, agreed. But as much as secian are want to be mad a dragons for not following their wishes, sometimes the secians do not understand a dragon's nature, either."

Tyviel'a says, "Sometimes. Blanket statements never work well in these type of meetings. :)"

Tyviel'a says, "Alright, that is all I have to say for now. If you want clarity, whisper to me to be added to list and I will try."

Tyviel'a asks Tiamat, "anything else?"

Tiamat shakes his head from side to side.

Maloveous wanders in behind the Secians and whispers quietly, "I will devour your souls little ones!"

Tiamat says, "THats it, and thanks."

Tyviel'a exclaims to Althulas, "come on down!"

Vaile grumbles at Meliya.

Syphon ponders the meaning of the universe for a moment.

Slade's stomach growls.

Althulas says, "actually what I have I think I am very sure of the answer, though I would like clarification for my own self knowing"

Meliya sniffles.

Vaile flails his arms about wildly at Tyviel'a.

Tyviel'a says, "See, he is the all wise."

Vaile says, "Of course..."

How about secian souls?

Vaile exclaims, "Secian pieces!"

Vaile beams.

Tyviel'a coughs.

Althulas says, "I know secians will boost and beef people to fight undead, but I don't understand why a secian would boost and beef someone to kill others, not even boosting both of them knowing that there actions are only causing further harm and suffering"

Syl chuckles at Vaile.

Marinda nods to Althulas.

Syl says to Vaile in Secian, "could feed the shrubbies really old elder pieces"

Syl snickers.

Tyviel'a exclaims to Althulas, "that -almost- sounds thinly veiled!"

Tyviel'a grins.

Tyviel'a asks Althulas, "care to elaborate?"

An army of tiny fuzzy creatures wander in and carry of Vaile chanting, "Meep meep meep!"

[Town Square Center.]

A massive gate dominates the center of Town Square. Monolithic stone imperial dragons stand to each side of the gate like sentinels keeping watch over the city of Spur. Beneath the colossal structure rests a large flowing marble fountain. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a shimmering blue pool. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each one a celebrated hero of Spur's past.  A carved marble statue of a Human, a carved marble statue of a Dragon, a broken brightly painted wooden birdhouse, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, and a flowing white marble fountain are here.

This area is illuminated.
You see the 1st boa constrictor (wearing a small gold collar) and the 1st white dove (wearing a small gold collar).

Sintari ponders the meaning of the universe for a moment.

[Town Square.]

The elegant Hotel Royale towers above the street, its emerald door sparkling in the light. The patrons that stroll in and out are catered to, doors opened and closed for them, and baggage and packages carried by harried servants. The large Bank of Spur sits on the east side of the square. Its location close to the Royale is not a coincidence. A gold-trimmed door is proof of the success of this branch of the Spurian bank and those who run it.  An elegant gold-trimmed walnut door, open emerald steel door, and a street lantern are here.

This area is illuminated.
You see the 1st tiny ruby faerie wyvern (wearing a small gold collar).
Obvious paths: north* southeast* west* northwest*.

>[The Royale.]

A short entrance hall provides passage in and out of the exquisite Hotel Royale. A burly Thugian and a tall Monitanian carefully assess everyone as they enter. They prevent any pets from entering and keep out all but the quickest or sneakiest of the riffraff. A narrow passageway leads to the stables.  An open emerald steel door is here.

This room is illuminated.
Obvious exits: south*.

>It looks like a small tiny ruby faerie wyvern.

It looks like a tiny draconic creature with intelligent golden eyes, glittering ruby scales and minute wings that are constantly in motion.
It has a head, 2 legs, and wings.

It appears to be in good shape.
It will be very hard for you to hit and it will be not too hard for it to hit you!

It is wearing a small gold collar.
