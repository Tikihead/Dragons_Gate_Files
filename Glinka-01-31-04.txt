The outward appearance of the people here seems a bit classier. Rich clothing and large coin purses are prevalent amongst the travelers. In fact, many of the folk heading into Town Square from the south are accompanied by large bodyguards to assure their safety. The well maintained road is lined with small brass lanterns, each swinging off an individual pole. No expense has been spared to keep those who travel this road safe from the hoodlums that relish the darkness.  A street lantern and some charred foliage are here.

This area is illuminated.
In the area are Draclaw the Leuian, Mashema the Leuian, and Lilyth the Noble Secian.

                        You have visualized the following locations
                        -------------------------------------------

                                    Visualization #1 is:
A beautiful crystal fountain, topped with the statue of King Rathanus the First, resides at the center of the plaza square. Water sprays from the king's open mouth and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular marble tiled pool. The fountain, a tribute to the founding ruler of Rathan, symbolizes Rathanus granting the breath of life to the once barren mountain side. Luminous crystal street lanterns, gilded marble benches, and delicately pruned rose bushes surround the perimeter of the square. Located at the very heart of the city, the plaza serves as a focal point for both business and casual interactions.

                                    Visualization #2 is:
Four sturdy walls and a roof of woven branches enclose this small tavern. From the forest floor, winding their way around the trunk of the Mother Tree, a set of intricately railed steps serve as the entrance and exit of the town of Treehaven. Strangers arriving at the top of the steps find themselves under the watchful eye of patrons seated at tables positioned about the light, airy room. A set of oak steps lead up to the new Council chambers.

                                    Visualization #3 is:
An abundant gallery of paintings depicting sacrifices and hold offerings to their god suspend from crooked iron nails. Resting beside each painting, cold black iron braziers appear to hold burned blood and bone. A few charred, blackened pieces can be found in them. Several iron chains hang along the walls of the sacrificial chamber. Along the floor, intricately placed colored slate tiles are coated in dust covered dried blood. Centering the room is a raised platform accessible through a flight of stairs. Upon this raised formation rests an altar inlaid with rows and rows of teeth.

Its location close to the Royale is not a coincidence. A gold-trimmed door is proof of the success of this branch of the Spurian bank and those who run it.  An elegant gold-trimmed walnut door, open emerald steel door, and a street lantern are here.

The outward appearance of the people here seems a bit classier. Rich clothing and large coin purses are prevalent amongst the travelers. In fact, many of the folk heading into Town Square from the south are accompanied by large bodyguards to assure their safety. The well maintained road is lined with small brass lanterns, each swinging off an individual pole. No expense has been spared to keep those who travel this road safe from the hoodlums that relish the darkness.  A street lantern and some charred foliage are here.

[Gateway.]

An elegant, carved wooden sign hangs above the ornate gateway set into the massive wall that divides Spurs Noble District from the Town Square. You can make out city guardsmen peering down attentively at all that approach from their posts atop the imposing wall. They seem to take a greater interest in this part of town, though there does not seem to be anything threatening enough here to warrant such attention.  A gilded silver plaque and a street lantern are here.

To the north, you can make out an ornately scrolled gateway set in the base of the imposing city wall. The refined roadway of Noble Way stretches out to the south. The cobblestones of the road are smooth and even. The attention to detail shown here is a dramatic change from some of the other parts of the city.  A street lantern is here.

An unusually large home, even for this part of town, lies off to the west. It seems as if one ambitious owner is slowly buying up the lots next to his and adding them to his own. Groundskeepers are at work in the surrounding gardens, trimming and raking, so intent on their work they do not bother to acknowledge the passing traffic on the road.  A street lantern is here.

Many grand, even ostentatious, homes line this stretch of Noble Way. Most of the residents here were fortunate enough to be born into the right families. Few that live in this area have ever actually had to work for a living. Glancing at the nameplates reveals many of the recognizable names of the Spur. Some of these names could almost be considered famous.  A street lantern is here.

Noble Way continues to wind its way among the rather modestly sized, but elegant, homes of the Spur's successful. Many a peasant farmer may live in homes larger than these, but none can match the quality found here. A peaceful, luxurious feeling pervades this part of town; perhaps it is the drifting floral scents wafting from the well-tended gardens.  A closed elegant black iron gate and a street lantern are here.

Gazing down each of the nearby private drives reveals a glimpse of a luxurious home, each a miniature estate in its own right. Short, stout walls and manicured hedges serve to keep out the riffraff and to protect the small, expensive gardens. Every detail has been attended to display the exotic plants, in all their pampered perfection.  A street lantern and a closed rosewood door are here.

Leaving the exceptionally wealthy estates of the Spurian nobility, Noble Way heads toward the Town Square to the northwest. Along the roadside can be seen the in-city homes of successful merchants and other wealthy citizens of the Spur. The homes display a slightly different style, perhaps they are not quite so restrained; a touch more exuberance and freedom with materials is displayed.  A street lantern is here.

The avenue comes to a fork, with Noble Way curving from south to the northwest. A side-street heading off to the east leads to an extremely well kept neighborhood that easily surpasses everything around it in splendor and magnificence. Everything, even the carefully pruned trees and the manicured shrubbery displays a desire for elegant perfection.  A street lantern is here.

The entire avenue is composed of fine cobblestone, each level with its neighbor, providing a smooth ride for passing carriages and horses. The stones were customized by craftsmen, cut to order, rather than simply placed wherever they might fit. A few stately oaks and elms line the sides of the road, shading travelers during the daylight hours.  A street lantern is here.

Numerous trees lining the avenue serve as the dividing border between the majestic estates of the nobility and the lightly traveled roadway. The estates themselves are noticeably closer to the avenue than those to the south. However, they are no easier to access, still protected by their own guarding walls, some covered with ivy or colorful blooming vines.  A street lantern is here.

A small roadway bordered by flowering hedges bisects the wide avenue of Noble Way at a right angle, heading east to west.  A thick, sturdy sign stands just off to the side of a charming path, its large friendly letters intent on luring travelers into the city's premiere roadstay, the Gilded Lion Inn. The entrance is clearly marked and welcoming, extending off to the southeast.  A wooden sign and a street lantern are here.

Majestic elms continue to line this broad roadway, sheltering the avenue on both sides and further enhancing the grandiose atmosphere. Fronting the beautiful homes, cobbled paths edged with narrow flower beds meander through nearby private gardens. Though they appear wonderful places to spend an afternoon or take a picnic, the glances from those tending the estates makes it clear they are only for the invited.  A street lantern is here.

The occasional locked gate marks the entrance to some of the more hidden estates of Spurs nobility. From this broad avenue, little can be seen of their splendor. Behind the imposing gate recedes a proud drive, disappearing mysteriously into the trees. If not for the large imposing tower rising above the hedges it would be hard to discern anything was beyond the gate. It is apparent the residents do not wish to be disturbed.  A street lantern, a closed morbius door, and an open black iron gate are here.

A well-guarded gateway separates the city's residential district from the farmlands just beyond. Guards carefully eye all that enter or exit the city, beckoning gruffly to random travelers for a closer inspection. The structure of the guards' barracks is visible above the road to the west. A weathered wooden sign is posted by the gate.  An open stone gate, a wooden sign, an open thick stone door, and a street lantern are here.

The darkness seems to go on and on as you find yourself more deeply immersed in this dark wood.  The deeper you go, the more claustrophobic it gets.  It's almost as if the trees are closing in on you.  An empty bottle of viscous black ichor and an empty bottle of viscous black ichor are here.

The trees here are quite different from those that are thriving in the rest of the forest.  The long, leafy branches hang so low that they almost form a wall, blocking your view of anything nearby.  Little patches of light must manage to sneak through here and there, since a few weeds seem to be surviving in what otherwise is a dark, dreary place.

The wall of leaves to the southeast seclude this grotto from the rest of the forest, yet they are still the easiest way in and out of here, since a sturdy wall prohibits you from making any further progress to the northwest.  A large stone in one wall appears to have some etchings in it, but is so weathered and so covered in white moss that the markings are now indecipherable.

Through the gate lies the city of Spur, the major center of trade and civilization on the plains. The dusty road leading through the gates is well traveled, and walls of the city are in good repair. A small shack sits to the west of the road, during most times of the day a dusty coach can be seen waiting in front, its horses stomping with impatience to be gone. To the right of the door is a small window, its opening covered with metal bars. An old man, missing most of his teeth, waits patiently for the travelers to pay their fare, and then directs them into the waiting area. On the east side of the road a billowing multicolored tent has been erected, the hustle and bustle of merchants and customers can be seen coming and going at all times of the day.  A rainbow silk tent and an open iron gate are here.

The occasional locked gate marks the entrance to some of the more hidden estates of Spurs nobility. From this broad avenue, little can be seen of their splendor. Behind the imposing gate recedes a proud drive, disappearing mysteriously into the trees. If not for the large imposing tower rising above the hedges it would be hard to discern anything was beyond the gate. It is apparent the residents do not wish to be disturbed.

Catcalls and whistles abound as she shows more thigh then is warranted. A wagon driver, distracted by the view, almost drives into a cart coming the opposite direction. Shouts are exchanged and fists shaken, as the San female snickers at all those involved.  A street lantern is here.

The foul odor of something that can be almost described as rotted corpses floats in from the east. You hear the cart drivers murmuring something about not eating the pressed cabbage, regardless of how good it tastes. They quickly point to the long line and the overflowing outhouse and wave their hands in front of their faces.  A street lantern is here.

Bazaar Path follows the line of the Spurian Wall. High above you can hear orders being barked and guards marching in rhythm. The closeness of the wall to the path has essentially blocked any breeze that might waft through the area. The stagnant air holds in the smells of food, incense and lots of bodies. It is not unusual to see the cart drivers with triangles of cloth pulled up over their nose and mouths.  A street lantern is here.

Several large carts head west, full of various items the owners are sure will sell for a decent profit. Empty carts, the sign of a prosperous day, head east. An old Thugian pulls and pushes a very stubborn donkey. Neither end seems to be cooperating with his demands. Two small children dance around the Thugian and the donkey, chanting and singing a nasty song. Quickly, he takes out a switch, which is enough encouragement for both the donkey to move and the children to run.  A street lantern is here.

The foot traffic on Bazaar Path turns south down a small trail into the heart of the Bazaar. Many of the smaller carts follow the buyers and merchants to avoid the conflicts with the larger wagons that continue west. The shouting up ahead quickens the pulse of even the most experienced seller.  A street lantern is here.

Deep, muddy ruts mar the road. A trickle of water flows from an unknown source creating a horrid hazard. Drivers curse one another for holding up the flow of traffic. Merchants and buyers carefully pick their way around the hold up, attempting to carefully navigate the slippery ground.  A street lantern is here.

Bazaar Path makes a sudden left hand turn, following the direction of the large Spurian Wall. Carts and wagons creak in protest as their heavy loads shift precariously.  Waiting for that rare item to fall from one of the merchant carts, several small Flerian children play in the dust at the side of the road.  A street lantern is here.

A break in the traffic shows a small worn path that heads to the west. Many travel that way, sure of their ability to navigate the stalls and tents that create this market place. The larger carts and those not too sure of themselves continue to head north. A small shack sits on the eastern side of the road, its door hanging precariously on its hinges.  A street lantern is here.

The going slows down briefly as someone stops dead in their tracks. Every so often one feels the need to take in the sounds and smells that are uniquely the Bazaar. Any slow down in the movement of the crowd creates a loud string of curses. The sellers are eager to get to market to get rid of their goods, and the buyers anticipate their purchases.  A street lantern is here.

The muffled noises you hear drifting in from the west come out of the Bazaar itself, a veritable hive of activity day and night. An occasion exotic smell is carried by the breeze to tantalize the nose. A large etched window displays tastefully dressed mannequins of many races.  An open sturdy mahogany door and a street lantern are here.

Further passage along Bazaar Path is blocked occasionally by brawling peasants. Fights break out over who got here first, who gets to sell first, whose goods are better and who should just pack up and leave. When guards are forced to leave their posts to settle the arguments, all involved lose.  A street lantern is here.

Many people crowd the narrow Bazaar Path, either heading towards the infamous Bazaar, or forcing their way back towards Trade Way. For a small price, a farmer can rent a booth and directly market his goods. Both some of the best and some of the worst deals can be made within this collection of stalls. The tall wall of Spur looms high to the east, and many of the guards take an early peek into the carts and the goods coming to market.  A street lantern is here.

This well-worn road separates the Bazaar to the north and Market Circle to the south. Only a Thugian could appreciate the layered odors of simmering foodstuffs and shoppers from the Bazaar. Crowds of people push past, some brushing against you. It might be a good idea to keep an eye on your coinpurse.  A street lantern is here.

The buildings of Market Circle stand to the south. It becomes obvious that the area through the arch is a much cleaner marketplace than the bazaar. An inviting eatery stands beside the road, its door open to those weary after a long trip to Spur, as well as those preparing to venture to the great expanses beyond the west gate. A human couple exit the building, arm in arm. A small sign stands beside the intersection.  A sign, an open glossy lacquered oak door, and a street lantern are here.

[Market Circle.]

An arch between two large buildings connects Market Circle and Market Street. The more reputable shopkeepers do business within the circle, but pay higher taxes for the privilege. The buildings have been built to last, as these merchants are no traveling tinkers. Interlocking stone walkways and colorful plantings span this central area. Despite the number of animals waiting outside the bank for their owners, the area is spotless. Loud chatter in many languages can be heard from the southwest.  A marble archway, an open elegant gold-trimmed walnut door, and a wooden sign are here.

This area is illuminated.
In the area are Draclaw the Leuian and Lilyth the Noble Secian (holding a glowing fiery ruby sorcerer's stone).
Obvious paths: north* northeast* east* southeast* south* southwest* west* northwest*.

[Market Street.]

Market Street ends here at a large archway. People bustle in and out of the arch, some without so much as a nod. The city wall rises up to the south and west of the buildings of Market Circle. A small sign is posted on the wall beside the archway.  A street lantern is here.

[Market Street.]

Situated between the well-traveled Trade Way to the north and the fine shops of Market Circle to the south, this small stretch of road is busy at all times of day. Adventurers with sacks of plundered goods leave Market Street and head west. A shrewd businessman has set up shop in this busy area of the Market District.  A street lantern is here.

[Trade & Market.]

The buildings of Market Circle stand to the south. It becomes obvious that the area through the arch is a much cleaner marketplace than the bazaar. An inviting eatery stands beside the road, its door open to those weary after a long trip to Spur, as well as those preparing to venture to the great expanses beyond the west gate. A human couple exit the building, arm in arm. A small sign stands beside the intersection.  A sign, an open glossy lacquered oak door, and a street lantern are here.

[Trade Way.]

This well-worn road separates the Bazaar to the north and Market Circle to the south. Only a Thugian could appreciate the layered odors of simmering foodstuffs and shoppers from the Bazaar. Crowds of people push past, some brushing against you. It might be a good idea to keep an eye on your coinpurse.  A street lantern is here.

Many townsfolk pass along this busy thoroughfare. Rich and poor alike mix freely on this street, much to the dismay of a passing nobleman. A young human struggles with an armful of packages and two young children in tow. Those in need of goods or supplies head west towards the market, those looking for the news of the day head east towards Town Square.  A street lantern is here.

A large gate separates the Merchant District and Town Square-the hub of Spur's activity. The partially opened gate is currently able to accommodate the simultaneous passage of several locals and visitors, but can be expanded to accept carriages, or sealed to ward against invasion.  Guards stand sentry from atop the wall as well as the ground.  A street lantern is here.

[Merchant Walk.]

Merchant Walk comes to an abrupt end at a massive moonsilver gate. The towering walls of Spur on either side of the gates force all to pass by the guards who are constantly on the watch for thieves and bandits. Just beyond the gates one can glimpse the bustling Merchant District of Spur.  A gilded oak sign and a street lantern are here.

Several city guardsmen have just finished wrestling to the ground some young tough thieves, who thought to rob one of the returning merchants. To one side a relieved-looking Fir Elf gentleman holds on tightly to his gold-tipped walking stick, as the human boy yells his innocence to any who might listen. His pleas fall on deaf ears as the guards drag him away.  A street lantern is here.

Merchants, some in frilly finery, others dressed in homespun wools, travel back and forth along this street on their way to and from work. They seem to blend together here, if only briefly. Several of the more haughty looking merchants are trailed by overloaded carts pushed along by haggard young apprentices.   A street lantern is here.

A neatly kept park fronts this portion of Merchant Walk. Topiary and low shrubberies partition off small sections of the park. Young lovers sit on benches almost hidden from view, gazing at each other with looks of love, oblivious to the continual bustle of passing customers and merchants on their way to do business.

People carrying bundles stream in from the west and rapidly lose themselves in the large crowds moving about in the vast town square. Several citizens head west with bulging coinpurses babbling excitedly about what they're going to purchase. Giggling children dart around the slower moving folks rushing on their way to spend the silvers in their pockets.  A street lantern is here.

Before you stands a magnificent white marble temple dedicated to Odarous, the god of chivalry. Ten giant steps made of the same gleaming marble lead up to the temple entrance. Two large statues stand at the base of the stairs, also carved of breath-taking marble. One is a warrior bearing a massive sword and a large shield. The other is a cleric with an amulet bearing the mark of Odarous in one hand and a large mace in the other.

A massive circular stone platform stands to the side of Magick Lane, strangely entrancing runes carved on every inch of its sides. The symbol of the god Sa, a golden Dragon, fills the space along the top. Raw power and magick seem to flow from the platform, making the air around it crackle with energy. A small sign stands next to the platform with a single word written upon it.  A rune covered platform, a SIGN, and a street lantern are here.

[Magick Lane.]

A small sign hangs from above the door of the well-kept store before you, telling you that it is a rune shop. The occasional bright flash of light from inside the store suggests all kinds of strange and rare magicks are being cast inside! Those who walk past you glance at the rune shop warily and hurry to get past it as quickly as possible. A small sign hangs from the doorknob of the store that reads "Flerians not allowed!"  An intricately carved oak door and a street lantern are here.

This area is illuminated.
In the area are Draclaw the Leuian, Mashema the Leuian, and Lilyth the Noble Secian (holding a glowing fiery ruby sorcerer's stone).

[Magick Lane.]

A squat ugly little shack stands somber on the eastern side of this well swept lane. A mysterious gothic structure rises from what was once scattered remains of an alchemy shop. A multi-colored stained glass window peers watchful from the crafty western building.  A rotting oak sign, a closed ugly rotting door, and a street lantern are here.

A low slung building resides on the west side of the street. Chanting can be heard from within.  Occasionally a few sparks rise into the sky, or some unwarranted raindrops begin, but they quickly are quelled. A large pair of wooden doors, their surface carved with rune symbols grace the entrance.  A street lantern and some open rune-etched wooden doors are here.

A massive circular stone platform stands to the side of Magick Lane, strangely entrancing runes carved on every inch of its sides. The symbol of the god Sa, a golden Dragon, fills the space along the top. Raw power and magick seem to flow from the platform, making the air around it crackle with energy. A small sign stands next to the platform with a single word written upon it.  A rune covered platform, a SIGN, and a street lantern are here.

[Knowledge Path.]

Knowledge Path terminates here at the gateway to the Magick District. In respect to the demands of the various religious and guild leaders, magick is kept as far from them as possible. A city plagued by rioting mage haters is the last thing Spur needs.  A street lantern is here.

Several members of the various mage orders of Spur and well-dressed shoppers seeking rarities travel along Knowledge's Path to and from the District of Magick. The district is the place to find the most talented artisans and craftiest merchants in Spur. It is also home to the mages of the non-elemental order.  A street lantern is here.

Knowledge Path heads out of the bustling Town Square and moves southwest towards the District of Magick and Rehas Way. Mixed with the robed mages that move southwest are merchants, customers and thieves alike. Moving quickly, especially with a full purse, is your best bet along this path.

Before you stands a magnificent white marble temple dedicated to Odarous, the god of chivalry. Ten giant steps made of the same gleaming marble lead up to the temple entrance. Two large statues stand at the base of the stairs, also carved of breath-taking marble. One is a warrior bearing a massive sword and a large shield. The other is a cleric with an amulet bearing the mark of Odarous in one hand and a large mace in the other.  Some gleaming white marble stairs, a polished white marble statue, a polished white marble statue, and a street lantern are here.

Commercial buildings flank Town Square to the west and south of this corner. Imposing buildings stand stiffly to your west, while those to the south have a slightly seedy look about them.  The door to the west has a freshly painted sign over it,  "Under New Management."  A closed tan weathered pine door, a large doorway, and a street lantern are here.

[Town Square Center.]

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.   A flowing white marble fountain, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a cracked marble statue of a Human, a carved marble statue of a Dragon, a rosewood sign, some flaming ruby ashes, a deep fluffy snow drift, a broken small canvas backpack, a short iron dirk, an empty small vial of madness cure, an empty bottle of viscous black ichor, a short iron dirk, and an open enchanting lionskin pouch are here.

[Town Square South.]

The outward appearance of the people here seems a bit classier. Rich clothing and large coin purses are prevalent amongst the travelers. In fact, many of the folk heading into Town Square from the south are accompanied by large bodyguards to assure their safety. The well maintained road is lined with small brass lanterns, each swinging off an individual pole. No expense has been spared to keep those who travel this road safe from the hoodlums that relish the darkness.  A street lantern and some charred foliage are here.

Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool.

[Town Square North.]

The traffic on the northern street heading away from town square is an eclectic bunch.  Those who belong to the guilds to the north travel in packs on their way to and from guild events.  It is not unusual to see a group of armored fighters passing a group of robed clerics, each heading in the opposite direction. The large temple of Rinanni rises to the north, its white marble almost glowing in the light.  A street lantern is here.

[Town Square Center.]

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.   A flowing white marble fountain, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a cracked marble statue of a Human, a carved marble statue of a Dragon, a rosewood sign, some flaming ruby ashes, a deep fluffy snow drift, a broken small canvas backpack, a short iron dirk, an empty small vial of madness cure, an empty bottle of viscous black ichor, a short iron dirk, a short iron dirk, a short iron dirk, a closed worn bearskin sack, an open enchanting lionskin pouch, and a closed weathered burlap sack are here.

No expense has been spared to keep those who travel this road safe from the hoodlums that relish the darkness.  A street lantern and some charred foliage are here.

Burn marks cover the walls of this chamber, apparently the result of spells gone awry. Here and there a trainer works with younger members of the temple, teaching them to use their magick, prayers, and skills to serve Sa. Some of the more accomplished members of the temple have given breathtaking performances in this room, showing novitiates the wonders of Sa.

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.   A flowing white marble fountain, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a cracked marble statue of a Human, a carved marble statue of a Dragon, a rosewood sign, some flaming ruby ashes, a deep fluffy snow drift, an empty small vial of madness cure, an empty bottle of viscous black ichor, a short iron dirk, a short iron dirk, a short iron dirk, a short iron dirk, and a dead grey mouse are here.

Smooth stones make up the street that leads from the center of Spur to the south. Each stone has been carefully fitted for the most comfortable travel by both cart and traveler alike. A well dressed Guard patrols the area in his dress uniform. Captains don't allow for slovenly appearances on this patrol.  A street lantern is here.

Southern Avenue leads between the center of Spur and the homes of the prosperous and wealthy. Several of the Ladies of the city stroll along the avenue chatting about the current events and latest gossip of the Spur. Behind them, harried servants carry their reticules and all those belongings that they cannot be without.  A street lantern is here.

Vast estates tower over the huge Spurian wall towards the south. The well-to-do who live in these homes idle away their days, enjoying the luxury of time. Standing next to a very empty lantern pole, a small Flerian child insists in a plaintive wail, that he had nothing to do with the missing lantern. The well-dressed guard that interrogates him keeps pointing at a small sack on the ground and its obvious contents.  An open small burlap sack and a street lantern are here.

The boughs of a large apple tree hang over the well tended avenue. Below the beautiful tree stands a small fountain. Atop the fountain is an intricately carved Secian who appears to be dancing with the water as it splashes around her. Set in the marble base is a small plaque that reads, "For those who have gone before us." Many stand for a moment as they pass this way, giving thanks for the gift of life that is given by both the apple tree and the Secians of long ago. Large piles of dirt and broken stone lay on either side of the street as workmen ready the east and west alleys for expansion.  A street lantern, a Secian etched moonsilver door, a pair of open silver forged swinging doors, and a sign above the doors are here.

Standing next to the large iron gate that separates the center of town from those of the elite class are several of the Spurian Guard. They are here to assist all who pass with the simple kindness of opening a gate, or the more important task of escorting those in need to the bank or market. A young looking cadet rubs wax into the stones of the city wall, his task is daunting, but one that will teach him discipline.  An open iron gate and a street lantern are here.

[Gateway.]

An elegant, carved wooden sign hangs above the ornate gateway set into the massive wall that divides Spurs Noble District from the Town Square. You can make out city guardsmen peering down attentively at all that approach from their posts atop the imposing wall. They seem to take a greater interest in this part of town, though there does not seem to be anything threatening enough here to warrant such attention.  A gilded silver plaque and a street lantern are here.

The cobblestones of the road are smooth and even. The attention to detail shown here is a dramatic change from some of the other parts of the city.  A street lantern is here.

An unusually large home, even for this part of town, lies off to the west. It seems as if one ambitious owner is slowly buying up the lots next to his and adding them to his own. Groundskeepers are at work in the surrounding gardens, trimming and raking, so intent on their work they do not bother to acknowledge the passing traffic on the road.  A street lantern is here.

Many grand, even ostentatious, homes line this stretch of Noble Way. Most of the residents here were fortunate enough to be born into the right families. Few that live in this area have ever actually had to work for a living. Glancing at the nameplates reveals many of the recognizable names of the Spur. Some of these names could almost be considered famous.  A street lantern is here.

Noble Way continues to wind its way among the rather modestly sized, but elegant, homes of the Spur's successful. Many a peasant farmer may live in homes larger than these, but none can match the quality found here. A peaceful, luxurious feeling pervades this part of town; perhaps it is the drifting floral scents wafting from the well-tended gardens.  A closed elegant black iron gate and a street lantern are here.

Gazing down each of the nearby private drives reveals a glimpse of a luxurious home, each a miniature estate in its own right. Short, stout walls and manicured hedges serve to keep out the riffraff and to protect the small, expensive gardens. Every detail has been attended to display the exotic plants, in all their pampered perfection.  A street lantern and a closed rosewood door are here.

Leaving the exceptionally wealthy estates of the Spurian nobility, Noble Way heads toward the Town Square to the northwest. Along the roadside can be seen the in-city homes of successful merchants and other wealthy citizens of the Spur. The homes display a slightly different style, perhaps they are not quite so restrained; a touch more exuberance and freedom with materials is displayed.  A street lantern is here.

The avenue comes to a fork, with Noble Way curving from south to the northwest.

The entire avenue is composed of fine cobblestone, each level with its neighbor, providing a smooth ride for passing carriages and horses. The stones were customized by craftsmen, cut to order, rather than simply placed wherever they might fit. A few stately oaks and elms line the sides of the road, shading travelers during the daylight hours.  A street lantern is here.

Numerous trees lining the avenue serve as the dividing border between the majestic estates of the nobility and the lightly traveled roadway. The estates themselves are noticeably closer to the avenue than those to the south. However, they are no easier to access, still protected by their own guarding walls, some covered with ivy or colorful blooming vines.  A street lantern is here.

A small roadway bordered by flowering hedges bisects the wide avenue of Noble Way at a right angle, heading east to west.  A thick, sturdy sign stands just off to the side of a charming path, its large friendly letters intent on luring travelers into the city's premiere roadstay, the Gilded Lion Inn. The entrance is clearly marked and welcoming, extending off to the southeast.  A wooden sign and a street lantern are here.

Majestic elms continue to line this broad roadway, sheltering the avenue on both sides and further enhancing the grandiose atmosphere.

Though they appear wonderful places to spend an afternoon or take a picnic, the glances from those tending the estates makes it clear they are only for the invited.  A street lantern is here.

The occasional locked gate marks the entrance to some of the more hidden estates of Spurs nobility. From this broad avenue, little can be seen of their splendor. Behind the imposing gate recedes a proud drive, disappearing mysteriously into the trees. If not for the large imposing tower rising above the hedges it would be hard to discern anything was beyond the gate. It is apparent the residents do not wish to be disturbed.  A street lantern, a closed morbius door, and an open black iron gate are here.

A well-guarded gateway separates the city's residential district from the farmlands just beyond. Guards carefully eye all that enter or exit the city, beckoning gruffly to random travelers for a closer inspection. The structure of the guards' barracks is visible above the road to the west. A weathered wooden sign is posted by the gate.  An open stone gate, a wooden sign, an open thick stone door, and a street lantern are here.

Through the gate lies the city of Spur, the major center of trade and civilization on the plains. The dusty road leading through the gates is well traveled, and walls of the city are in good repair. A small shack sits to the west of the road, during most times of the day a dusty coach can be seen waiting in front, its horses stomping with impatience to be gone. To the right of the door is a small window, its opening covered with metal bars. An old man, missing most of his teeth, waits patiently for the travelers to pay their fare, and then directs them into the waiting area. On the east side of the road a billowing multicolored tent has been erected, the hustle and bustle of merchants and customers can be seen coming and going at all times of the day.  A rainbow silk tent and an open iron gate are here.

A hedge of spiky brambles forms a natural division from the lands and the swampy terrain to the south. Tall, limbless trees dot the horizon there, their bases lost in the misty depths of the gases hovering over the waters. Now and then a strange, growling sound echos up to the north, or an odd, high-pitched call of some unseen crow, probably feasting on a fallen creature hidden in the mists. The path curves away from the sounds, as popular choice has preferred to travel around the edges, rather than through the marshy sludge.

The open plains are becoming scattered with scraggly trees, the wood of which proving inefficient to use for building as the elements of nature have grown the trunks so twisted and hard in order to withstand the onslaughts of time. Circling around the northern base of a small hill, there lies the lapping edge of the swamp to the south. Small slimy creatures lie on the smooth stones near the water, darting into it at the speed of light as you near them with tiny splashes and echoing wakes blending into the small, gentle waves coming into the shore. Swarms of mosquitoes move along the land in unison, lending them the appearance of large, unified bodies hovering around for the next feast.

Ravens dark as pitch spread their feathers to a wing-span of nearly four feet, so large they are, as they quarrel over an abandoned mule carcass on the roadside breaks out. How final death seems, so casually nature simply encompasses the bodies of the fallen, through carrion hunters or moldy decay. Yet through death there be life again, any number of these ravens being sustained through this death, so they may live. Perhaps only to become sustenance for one of the swamp creatures, who, in turn, spends its life continuing the cycle.

                                    Visualization #1 is:
A beautiful crystal fountain, topped with the statue of King Rathanus the First, resides at the center of the plaza square. Water sprays from the king's open mouth and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular marble tiled pool. The fountain, a tribute to the founding ruler of Rathan, symbolizes Rathanus granting the breath of life to the once barren mountain side. Luminous crystal street lanterns, gilded marble benches, and delicately pruned rose bushes surround the perimeter of the square. Located at the very heart of the city, the plaza serves as a focal point for both business and casual interactions.

                                    Visualization #2 is:
Four sturdy walls and a roof of woven branches enclose this small tavern. From the forest floor, winding their way around the trunk of the Mother Tree, a set of intricately railed steps serve as the entrance and exit of the town of Treehaven. Strangers arriving at the top of the steps find themselves under the watchful eye of patrons seated at tables positioned about the light, airy room. A set of oak steps lead up to the new Council chambers.

                                    Visualization #3 is:
An abundant gallery of paintings depicting sacrifices and hold offerings to their god suspend from crooked iron nails. Resting beside each painting, cold black iron braziers appear to hold burned blood and bone. A few charred, blackened pieces can be found in them. Several iron chains hang along the walls of the sacrificial chamber. Along the floor, intricately placed colored slate tiles are coated in dust covered dried blood. Centering the room is a raised platform accessible through a flight of stairs. Upon this raised formation rests an altar inlaid with rows and rows of teeth.

Four sturdy walls and a roof of woven branches enclose this small tavern. From the forest floor, winding their way around the trunk of the Mother Tree, a set of intricately railed steps serve as the entrance and exit of the town of Treehaven. Strangers arriving at the top of the steps find themselves under the watchful eye of patrons seated at tables positioned about the light, airy room. A set of oak steps lead up to the new Council chambers.  An ivory inlaid pine bar, a wooden stool, a long weathered wooden bench, a long musty wooden table, some steps circling the tree, some freshly crafted oak steps, an open door, a paper covered posting board, and a gilt framed painting on the wall are here.

Contrasting starkly with the ashes of the forest and brush is a freshly constructed set of stairs that wraps itself about the large tree. The intricate woodwork that decorates the steps is of the finest quality, as if in parody to the blackened destruction of the hedges and brambles around the base of the trunk. Bright green leaves of clover have begun springing up through the ashy soil in conjunction with soft moss to lend a durable cushion to this well-traveled spot.  Some steps circling the tree, a freshly painted wooden sign, a healthy green patch of clover, a flowing marble fountain, and some clover shaped stones are here.

The path of four leaf clove shaped flagstones leads past a small clean shack and into a well formed tunnel through the thorn bushes to the east and the Caersech to the west. The small shack is set back from the road, its walls built of a whitewashed birch. A sturdy corral, filled with well-fed horses, stands to the left of the shack. A matched pair of dapple grays stand in front of the shack waiting to take their human baggage to their destination. To the left of the door, behind a small paned window, a beautiful Fir Elf female takes coin and in return, with a charming smile, directs those who have paid their fare into the waiting room.  A small shack, a freshly painted sign, a notice of non-refund, and a small winding stone pathway are here.

Weapon racks, armor stands, display cases; something involving weapons and armor cover nearly every free space of the floor. Amidst the pile of equipment a crowded sales counter takes up a considerable portion of the northern wall. A young Firian mans the counter, hastily eating a sandwich in between customer transactions. Out of sight, a female voice mutters loudly, "Where will everything fit?"

The smell of fresh-cut pine fills your nose as you enter the building.  Fresh boughs hang from rafters that are not too far above your head, lending their scent to keeping the pavilion smelling fresh. The majority of the building is taken up by a commons area of packed dirt in the center where customers and merchants alike can see what is being bought and sold all around.  An open blackened pine door and an open elegant carved rosewood door are here.

Small wildflowers and large tufts of grass cover the ground around the well-worn path that winds across the forest floor. A number of young saplings sprout eagerly from the ground around the remains of a once tall maidenhair. Standing beside the path is the Merchant's Pavilion, nestled comfortably among the brush.  An open pine door, a large green silk tent, and some colorful wild flowers are here.

A fine haze of dust hovers over the remains of the Silver Owl Inn. Through the fallen timbers and memories of lives lost, one can see brilliant green sprouts reaching for sunlight. A tiny songbird perches on an old stick of furniture poking through the rubble, singing sweetly to herald new life and hope. A small winding path of stones placed in the shape of four leaf clovers winds itself through the forest.  A small winding stone pathway and a charred ancient steelwood tree are here.

The path of four leaf clove shaped flagstones leads past a small clean shack and into a well formed tunnel through the thorn bushes to the east and the Caersech to the west. The small shack is set back from the road, its walls built of a whitewashed birch. A sturdy corral, filled with well-fed horses, stands to the left of the shack. A matched pair of dapple grays stand in front of the shack waiting to take their human baggage to their destination. To the left of the door, behind a small paned window, a beautiful Fir Elf female takes coin and in return, with a charming smile, directs those who have paid their fare into the waiting room.  A small shack, a freshly painted sign, a notice of non-refund, and a small winding stone pathway are here.

Contrasting starkly with the ashes of the forest and brush is a freshly constructed set of stairs that wraps itself about the large tree. The intricate woodwork that decorates the steps is of the finest quality, as if in parody to the blackened destruction of the hedges and brambles around the base of the trunk. Bright green leaves of clover have begun springing up through the ashy soil in conjunction with soft moss to lend a durable cushion to this well-traveled spot.  Some steps circling the tree, a freshly painted wooden sign, a healthy green patch of clover, a flowing marble fountain, and some clover shaped stones are here.

Strangers arriving at the top of the steps find themselves under the watchful eye of patrons seated at tables positioned about the light, airy room. A set of oak steps lead up to the new Council chambers.

The view of the forest to the northwest is quite panoramic, despite the burnt spikes of trees in the midst. A staircase here seems to have some enchantment, judging by the strange appearance of unicorns, bears and owls on the lower steps. Strange, due to the fact that they don't appear carved, painted, or put there by any hand-made means. It is as if the glyphs grew into the wood itself.

Several monks wearing floor length robes sit in silence, with the occasional clasped hands rising up in a particularly vibrant part of prayer. The altar itself is composed of growing flowers, the tiny buds enclosing gems and gold alike. Around the base of the altar grows a ring of mushrooms, vibrantly cloaked in red with white spots dotting the umbrellas.

A large tapestry lines the outside wall of the passageway, most impressive in that it is not made of fabric, but of vines as tiny as thick hairs, growing in a weave. The delicate shadings of the plants is perfectly natural, and as the eye becomes unfocused, a picture of a diminutive, beautiful maiden sits amongst a foresty background. The wall opposite of this magnificent tapestry is lined with portraits of prominent temple leaders, the colors vibrant, bringing a life-like sense to the frames. The eyes of the maiden in the tapestry seem to follow you, staring directly as you pass, boring into your soul.  A vellum portrait, a canvas portrait, a suede portrait, some unfinished portraits, and a carefully painted silk screen are here.

A staircase here seems to have some enchantment, judging by the strange appearance of unicorns, bears and owls on the lower steps. Strange, due to the fact that they don't appear carved, painted, or put there by any hand-made means. It is as if the glyphs grew into the wood itself. Mysterious symbols are scattered throughout the portraits, which shimmer with a golden whisper as they are approached.

Swollen beyond its banks, the once small creek is now a rushing overflowing river. What used to be the charred footbridge is now a safe haven for fish well down river, nothing left of its structure. Set well into the bank of the river is a long steel pole. Lashed to the pole is a heavy rope. The voice of the riverboat captain can be heard echoing across the water, taking command and moving his cargo.  A flowing river, a freshly painted sign, some carved oak benches, a snow angel, a pile of snow, and a riverboat are here.

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.   A flowing white marble fountain, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a cracked marble statue of a Human, a carved marble statue of a Dragon, a rosewood sign, some flaming ruby ashes, a deep fluffy snow drift, an empty small vial of madness cure, an empty bottle of viscous black ichor, a short iron dirk, a short iron dirk, a short iron dirk, a short iron dirk, a dead grey mouse, a short iron dirk, and a short iron dirk are here.

The footbridge that once connected this path to its match on the other side of the overflowing rushing river is now nothing more then a few charred pilings. Tiny insects buzz around their remains, finding a comfortable new home. Lashed to the remains of one of the more sturdy pilings is a tall steel pole. Wrapped around the pole, and tied securely is a taut rope. Bobbing ever so lightly due to the strain of the riverboat, the rope holds tight.  A flowing river, a freshly painted sign, some carved oak benches, and a riverboat are here.

A small orb of light hovers in the center of the path before you, only to disappear as you near it, reappearing further away into the swamp. Stepping near the orb to investigate closer only causes it to again blink out of existence, forming once more, deeper into the mists. It soon becomes apparent that the mysterious lights are attempting to slyly lead you into the swamp. To or for what purpose, is the question.

Ravens dark as pitch spread their feathers to a wing-span of nearly four feet, so large they are, as they quarrel over an abandoned mule carcass on the roadside breaks out. How final death seems, so casually nature simply encompasses the bodies of the fallen, through carrion hunters or moldy decay. Yet through death there be life again, any number of these ravens being sustained through this death, so they may live. Perhaps only to become sustenance for one of the swamp creatures, who, in turn, spends its life continuing the cycle.

Eyes of creatures too quick to be seen monitor your progress along the road. Their footprints can be seen occasionally, leading back and forth across the path, sometimes following along the edges, bringing to mind the vision of something that might be following you, at this very moment, leaving tiny or perhaps not so tiny footprints along the edge of the road as it stalks its prey.

The dried trees encroach even up to the roadside, here, their limbs reaching down to the passage as if to snatch the unwary passer-by. A sudden shift in the wind brings forth the sullied aroma of death and decay from the swamp southern lands. Slurpish noises belie the path of some creature traveling through the muddy scape, their movements hidden behind the smoky mist that reduces visibility to a mere few feet past the swamp's edge.

The open plains are becoming scattered with scraggly trees, the wood of which proving inefficient to use for building as the elements of nature have grown the trunks so twisted and hard in order to withstand the onslaughts of time. Circling around the northern base of a small hill, there lies the lapping edge of the swamp to the south. Small slimy creatures lie on the smooth stones near the water, darting into it at the speed of light as you near them with tiny splashes and echoing wakes blending into the small, gentle waves coming into the shore. Swarms of mosquitoes move along the land in unison, lending them the appearance of large, unified bodies hovering around for the next feast.

A hedge of spiky brambles forms a natural division from the lands and the swampy terrain to the south. Tall, limbless trees dot the horizon there, their bases lost in the misty depths of the gases hovering over the waters. Now and then a strange, growling sound echos up to the north, or an odd, high-pitched call of some unseen crow, probably feasting on a fallen creature hidden in the mists. The path curves away from the sounds, as popular choice has preferred to travel around the edges, rather than through the marshy sludge.

Through the gate lies the city of Spur, the major center of trade and civilization on the plains. The dusty road leading through the gates is well traveled, and walls of the city are in good repair. A small shack sits to the west of the road, during most times of the day a dusty coach can be seen waiting in front, its horses stomping with impatience to be gone. To the right of the door is a small window, its opening covered with metal bars. An old man, missing most of his teeth, waits patiently for the travelers to pay their fare, and then directs them into the waiting area. On the east side of the road a billowing multicolored tent has been erected, the hustle and bustle of merchants and customers can be seen coming and going at all times of the day.  A rainbow silk tent and an open iron gate are here.

The occasional locked gate marks the entrance to some of the more hidden estates of Spurs nobility. From this broad avenue, little can be seen of their splendor. Behind the imposing gate recedes a proud drive, disappearing mysteriously into the trees. If not for the large imposing tower rising above the hedges it would be hard to discern anything was beyond the gate. It is apparent the residents do not wish to be disturbed.

Many stand for a moment as they pass this way, giving thanks for the gift of life that is given by both the apple tree and the Secians of long ago.

[Town Square.]

The elegant Hotel Royale towers above the street, its emerald door sparkling in the light. The patrons that stroll in and out are catered to, doors opened and closed for them, and baggage and packages carried by harried servants. The large Bank of Spur sits on the east side of the square. Its location close to the Royale is not a coincidence. A gold-trimmed door is proof of the success of this branch of the Spurian bank and those who run it.  An elegant gold-trimmed walnut door, open emerald steel door, and a street lantern are here.

This area is illuminated.

[Town Square South.]

The outward appearance of the people here seems a bit classier. Rich clothing and large coin purses are prevalent amongst the travelers. In fact, many of the folk heading into Town Square from the south are accompanied by large bodyguards to assure their safety. The well maintained road is lined with small brass lanterns, each swinging off an individual pole. No expense has been spared to keep those who travel this road safe from the hoodlums that relish the darkness.  A street lantern and some charred foliage are here.

Commercial buildings flank Town Square to the west and south of this corner. Imposing buildings stand stiffly to your west, while those to the south have a slightly seedy look about them.

Before you stands a magnificent white marble temple dedicated to Odarous, the god of chivalry. Ten giant steps made of the same gleaming marble lead up to the temple entrance. Two large statues stand at the base of the stairs, also carved of breath-taking marble. One is a warrior bearing a massive sword and a large shield. The other is a cleric with an amulet bearing the mark of Odarous in one hand and a large mace in the other.  Some gleaming white marble stairs, a polished white marble statue, a polished white marble statue, and a street lantern are here.

Named after the first merchant to travel to Spur and set up shop, this road is now home to many of the Spur's finest merchants. Beautifully crafted wrought iron street lanterns line the avenue, brightening even the drabbest of days. A large stone building stands to the north of the road, intricate glowing runes adorn its entrance.   An open rune-inscribed moonsilver door, a gilded steelwood sign, and a street lantern are here.

Rehas Way continues on next to the high city wall above you. Every now and then, a guardsmen looks down, checking for magick users up to no good. Rich merchants are always relocating to this area to sell their fine and exotic wares.  An open steel banded oak door, a finely engraved gold plaque, and a street lantern are here.

Growing up the large Spurian Wall is a a beautiful carpet of ivy. Running along the base of the wall are several large carefully tended rose bushes. Opposite the wall is a beautiful oak building with a fresh coating of paint and several large stained glass windows. A crimson banner is draped over the doorway that reads "Grand Opening."  A pair of closed intricate oak double doors and a street lantern are here.

The old temple that was here has been refurbished and now has a broad banner exclaiming "Gruggle's Emporium!"  Blue and red streamers cascade down from the pillars and a broad red carpet covers the steps of the building. Strange noises emanate from the interior of Gruggle's place. His ability to capture and tame even the most wild of animals is world renowned. The fact that many give wide berth around his doorway convinces any casual observer that Spurians are still not very confident in his capabilities.  A giant wooden arch and a street lantern are here.

A long-bearded Hithual carefully directs an eclectic group of workers in the building of a new shop. His calm voice points out those errors that would keep this building from being up to his high standards. Quality must be assured by this stout architect. The workers each take turns sitting beneath a large oak tree, a welcome relief from their hard work. A small sign next to the door proudly proclaims, "Pierini's Gems".  A beautiful large oak tree, a street lantern, and an open lacquered silver maple door are here.

The sweet melody of a stringed instrument floats out the open window of the sturdy building on the southern side of Rehas Way. Several Guards can be seen hanging over the parapet of the Spurian Wall, their hands tapping with the rhythm of the music. In an elaborate scroll someone has written on the side of the building, "Tintamarre's Instruments."  A plain oak door and a street lantern are here.

Built as a "home away from home," this building is an outlet of the famous Sigrid's Place in Saldaea. The small yard in front has carefully trimmed grass, surrounded by a low hedge. Small stepping stones bisect the yard leading you to a grand door bearing the signature "Crossed Swords." Traffic is heavy along this portion of Rehas Way. Even though it is a rare occurrence to find Sigrid or her Uncle Reyranald in attendance, when they are the line can quickly build around the block for a chance to purchase a weapon from them.  An open green steelwood door and a street lantern are here.

City guards lean over the walls above watching all who pass into the area. Some are stationed to help protect the interests of the traveling merchants, others to keep an eye on rogues. A large open area stands between the western Spurian Wall and Milene's Outpost. Deep ruts mar the ground, made from the traveling merchant wagons that are known to frequent this area. Whether they park for the evening or for a week, their goods are highly sought after.  An archway, a closed intricately carved steelwood door, an intricately carved steelwood sign, and a street lantern are here.

The relative safety inside Spur is a comfort to those returning from the fields and mountains. To those leaving, a massive wall of defense around the city lies ahead. Archer towers beside the gate overlook the wall, offering a painful welcome to would-be invaders. Several guards on foot patrol pass and disappear behind a thick, bluesteel banded steelwood door. Wall road stretches to the south, a wide passage between the city wall and several large buildings.  An open iron gate, an open thick stone door, and a street lantern are here.

Travelers from Rathan to the northwest, and the Trade Route to the south, converge at Spur's west gate. Guards posted on the ground give those seeking to enter the city a cursory once-over. Their lack of interest shows that anyone approaching has already been observed from above for some time. A grate in the ground loosens mud from wagon wheels and hooves before they pass through the gate, helping to keep the streets of Spur fairly clean.  An open giant black iron gate, a giant green oak tree, a small blue pool, a thick oak grate over the pool, and a polished stone marker are here.

The skeletal remains of what was once a cow lies half submerged in the water, its carcass picked clean by scavengers.

A variety of strange markings cover the ground, most of them are unlike anything you have ever seen before. An experienced and well traveled forester might have some hope of identifying the creatures that made them, but the task is beyond your capabilities. Smoke billows out of the woods to the north, and you wonder what lies there.

What once was the intersection of two roads is now a single road paralleled by a massive amount of rock, mud and timber. A new landslide covers the older settled debris making passage to the northeast impossible. Rocks and pebbles lay across the path making movement precarious. The new landslide still groans and shifts ever so slightly.

Old trees lay side by side with the massive boulders of the mountain, intermingling in a terrible landslide.

A massive rent opens up between the mountain side heading south. Boulders sit precariously on the mountain side ready to fall to the ground. Many tons of earth have shifted from the face of the mountain to the ground, covering the small growth of forest at its base. The southeastern road is totally blocked with rubble.

Bright green oases of life sprout from rocky niches and the path is slippery where the green slimy growths cross it.

Cracks and crevasses mar trail's surface, as runoff from the mountain snow makes its way to lower ground. Lush green bushes, and small trees dot the landscape, mingling with large boulders and smaller rocks.  A large pile of rocks is here.

A small crack in the road spills forth a small stream of dirty brown water. Nearer the road edge, close to the drop down the mountain side, the erosion is terrible. In time, if the flow of water continues, the road may wash away without much of a trace.

Flowering shrubs and thin aspen trees spread out through the western garden, stopping only at the grey base of the mountain which soars high overhead. A small pond, filled with white swans and tall grassy plants, extends from the cobblestone path and further into the garden. The moist air is cool and tends to cling to the broad leafed trees that reach their limbs above the pathway.  A closed giant turquoise trimmed steel drawbridge and a deep bluish green moat are here.

A pleasant breeze rustles the hardy pine trees which line this cobblestone street. A large establishment of deep purple crystal dwarfs the other structures, its silver spires reaching high overhead.

The street widens sharply to the east and west in a delta of smoother stone, either side trailed by a lawn of low-cut green grass. A polished white stairway leads up to a great silver gate, its body set within a massive carved archway which itself is centered within the crystal wall.

The grand ivy covered buildings of the city of Rathan rise side by side along the road and increase in splendor further to the north. Large stained glass windows, silvery rooftops, and artfully crafted wood workings adorn the majestic structures. Townsfolk casually stroll down the silver paved streets, enjoying the crisp mountain air. The savory aroma of food roasting over a log fire drifts in from somewhere nearby.  Some wooden and stone buildings, an ivy-covered wrought iron fence, and some wild violet lilacs are here.

A small, chilly-looking stream rushes briskly down the rocky terrain, and an ancient stone bridge provides passage across it. The bridge itself has been slightly eroded by time, but its demonic features are still quite visible. The pleasant moonflowers that bloom at its base provide a stark contrast to the bridge's sinister appeal.  An ancient demon-headed stone bridge, a flowing pale blue stream, and some glowing silvery moonflowers are here.

[City of Rathan, Main Gate.]

A wide silver paved road begins at the city's main gate and ascends toward the heart of Rathan. The scenic view of the city from this point is truly captivating. A multitude of silvery roofed buildings, surrounded by tall evergreen trees, rise along the Silver Mountain's southern slope. Far to the north, the snowcapped peak of the Silver Mountain rises above the glimmering crystal dome of the Rathene Royal Palace. City guards, merchants, and townsfolk continuously pass through the gate set in the outer wall to the south.  A giant carved granite wall, an open giant silver gate, and some glowing silvery moonflowers are here.

In the area are Raptorian the Noble Secian (flying beside you), Linneastrylon the Noble Secian (flying 5 feet above you and holding a glowing sparkling blue orb of Sa), Gwen the Secian (flying 5 feet above you), Caylith the Drake (flying beside you), Forsythia the Drake (flying 5 feet above you), and Ceresina the Noble Secian (flying 5 feet above you).
Obvious paths: southwest northwest.
