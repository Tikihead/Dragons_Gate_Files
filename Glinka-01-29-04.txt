The road here forks in three directions. The area to the southeast seems to be more forested than where you are now. A small mountain of rock splits the two other paths to the west and northwest.

This area is illuminated.
You see the 1st lizardman and the 1st ferret (wearing a small gold collar).

A multitude of silvery roofed buildings, surrounded by tall evergreen trees, rise along the Silver Mountain's southern slope. Far to the north, the snowcapped peak of the Silver Mountain rises above the glimmering crystal dome of the Rathene Royal Palace. City guards, merchants, and townsfolk continuously pass through the gate set in the outer wall to the south.  A giant carved granite wall, an open giant silver gate, and some glowing silvery moonflowers are here.

                                    Visualization #1 is:
Mysterious mists form the barrier around this strange garden. Nothing can be seen of the route you took to get here. Giant sized flowers bloom all around you, each one a different color and shade. A lush carpet of jewel green grass cushions your feet. The call of exotic birds echo through the air. Breaking through the path of flowers you come upon a small clump of peach trees. Luscious fruits hang from their drooping branches. Some have already been plucked and placed in a large straw basket. At the center of the stand of trees is spread a large quilted blanket. Upon closer examination of the quilt you notice each square shows a different stage of being in the life of a dragon. Quiet descends around you, filling the area with a sense of peace.

                                    Visualization #2 is:
Four sturdy walls and a roof of woven branches enclose this small tavern. From the forest floor, winding their way around the trunk of the Mother Tree, a set of intricately railed steps serve as the entrance and exit of the town of Treehaven. Strangers arriving at the top of the steps find themselves under the watchful eye of patrons seated at tables positioned about the light, airy room. A set of oak steps lead up to the new Council chambers.

                                    Visualization #3 is:
An abundant gallery of paintings depicting sacrifices and hold offerings to their god suspend from crooked iron nails. Resting beside each painting, cold black iron braziers appear to hold burned blood and bone. A few charred, blackened pieces can be found in them. Several iron chains hang along the walls of the sacrificial chamber. Along the floor, intricately placed colored slate tiles are coated in dust covered dried blood. Centering the room is a raised platform accessible through a flight of stairs. Upon this raised formation rests an altar inlaid with rows and rows of teeth.

A beautiful crystal fountain, topped with the statue of King Rathanus the First, resides at the center of the plaza square. Water sprays from the king's open mouth and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular marble tiled pool. The fountain, a tribute to the founding ruler of Rathan, symbolizes Rathanus granting the breath of life to the once barren mountain side. Luminous crystal street lanterns, gilded marble benches, and delicately pruned rose bushes surround the perimeter of the square. Located at the very heart of the city, the plaza serves as a focal point for both business and casual interactions.  A large glistening silver crystal fountain, some silver gilded marble benches, and some blooming silvery bushes of Rathene roses are here.

This area is illuminated.
In the area are Equality the Noble Secian (seated), Miriel the Secian (seated), Yggdrasil the Noble Draco (seated and holding a glowing fragrant gnarled walnut pipe), Charis the Novice Secian, and Weldoian the Novice Secian (seated).

[Central Plaza Square.]

A beautiful crystal fountain, topped with the statue of King Rathanus the First, resides at the center of the plaza square. Water sprays from the king's open mouth and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular marble tiled pool. The fountain, a tribute to the founding ruler of Rathan, symbolizes Rathanus granting the breath of life to the once barren mountain side. Luminous crystal street lanterns, gilded marble benches, and delicately pruned rose bushes surround the perimeter of the square. Located at the very heart of the city, the plaza serves as a focal point for both business and casual interactions.  A large glistening silver crystal fountain, some silver gilded marble benches, and some blooming silvery bushes of Rathene roses are here.

Vertical dark brown wooden boards panel the front of a tall building snugly wedged into the southwest corner of the plaza. Various pots, urns, and sacks of goods are on display upon a large table at its entrance. Next door, another small building sits open for business. Its facade of red and brown bricks gives it a refined, yet simplistic appearance. A pair of seasoned old Humans casually lounge upon a carved bench to the side of the building, mumbling on about their younger years.  An open simple painted pine door and an open carved applewood door are here.

A beautiful crystal fountain, topped with the statue of King Rathanus the First, resides at the center of the plaza square. Water sprays from the king's open mouth and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular marble tiled pool. The fountain, a tribute to the founding ruler of Rathan, symbolizes Rathanus granting the breath of life to the once barren mountain side. Luminous crystal street lanterns, gilded marble benches, and delicately pruned rose bushes surround the perimeter of the square. Located at the very heart of the city, the plaza serves as a focal point for both business and casual interactions.  A large glistening silver crystal fountain, some silver gilded marble benches, and some blooming silvery bushes of Rathene roses are here.

                                    Visualization #1 is:
Mysterious mists form the barrier around this strange garden. Nothing can be seen of the route you took to get here. Giant sized flowers bloom all around you, each one a different color and shade. A lush carpet of jewel green grass cushions your feet. The call of exotic birds echo through the air. Breaking through the path of flowers you come upon a small clump of peach trees. Luscious fruits hang from their drooping branches. Some have already been plucked and placed in a large straw basket. At the center of the stand of trees is spread a large quilted blanket. Upon closer examination of the quilt you notice each square shows a different stage of being in the life of a dragon. Quiet descends around you, filling the area with a sense of peace.

                                    Visualization #2 is:
Four sturdy walls and a roof of woven branches enclose this small tavern. From the forest floor, winding their way around the trunk of the Mother Tree, a set of intricately railed steps serve as the entrance and exit of the town of Treehaven. Strangers arriving at the top of the steps find themselves under the watchful eye of patrons seated at tables positioned about the light, airy room. A set of oak steps lead up to the new Council chambers.

                                    Visualization #3 is:
An abundant gallery of paintings depicting sacrifices and hold offerings to their god suspend from crooked iron nails. Resting beside each painting, cold black iron braziers appear to hold burned blood and bone. A few charred, blackened pieces can be found in them. Several iron chains hang along the walls of the sacrificial chamber. Along the floor, intricately placed colored slate tiles are coated in dust covered dried blood. Centering the room is a raised platform accessible through a flight of stairs. Upon this raised formation rests an altar inlaid with rows and rows of teeth.

Old trees lay side by side with the massive boulders of the mountain, intermingling in a terrible landslide. The mountain top has broken off and slid across the eastern road stopping all forms of transportation. It would take years for mortal hands to remove the tons of stone from the original roadway to make it passable once again. Thankfully, nature has changed the landscape for the better, and has opened a gap through the mountain to the north.

You shake your head and move on.

Littering the area are pieces of broken wagon, bits of human remains and dried splotches of blood. The remnants of a violent fight lie all around you, whomever used to belong to the wagon is no more than vulture food.  A bloody severed foot is here.

Travelers from Rathan to the northwest, and the Trade Route to the south, converge at Spur's west gate. Guards posted on the ground give those seeking to enter the city a cursory once-over. Their lack of interest shows that anyone approaching has already been observed from above for some time. A grate in the ground loosens mud from wagon wheels and hooves before they pass through the gate, helping to keep the streets of Spur fairly clean.  An open giant black iron gate, a giant green oak tree, a small blue pool, a thick oak grate over the pool, and a polished stone marker are here.

The relative safety inside Spur is a comfort to those returning from the fields and mountains. To those leaving, a massive wall of defense around the city lies ahead. Archer towers beside the gate overlook the wall, offering a painful welcome to would-be invaders. Several guards on foot patrol pass and disappear behind a thick, bluesteel banded steelwood door. Wall road stretches to the south, a wide passage between the city wall and several large buildings.  An open iron gate, an open thick stone door, and a street lantern are here.

Deep grey mists surround a strange pile of rubble that lies south of the road. Occasionally a priest clad in a simple grey robe will wander past the rubble and whisper a short prayer under his breath.

The buildings of Market Circle stand to the south. It becomes obvious that the area through the arch is a much cleaner marketplace than the bazaar. An inviting eatery stands beside the road, its door open to those weary after a long trip to Spur, as well as those preparing to venture to the great expanses beyond the west gate. A human couple exit the building, arm in arm. A small sign stands beside the intersection.  A sign, an open glossy lacquered oak door, and a street lantern are here.

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.   A flowing white marble fountain, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a cracked marble statue of a Human, a carved marble statue of a Dragon, a rosewood sign, some flaming ruby ashes, a deep fluffy snow drift, a Psycian star patterned porcelain jug, an empty chilled mug of flower essence, a short iron dirk, a short iron dirk, a closed delicate lionskin pouch, a closed tattered cloth bag, and an empty pewter tankard of hithual beer are here.

The outward appearance of the people here seems a bit classier. Rich clothing and large coin purses are prevalent amongst the travelers. In fact, many of the folk heading into Town Square from the south are accompanied by large bodyguards to assure their safety. The well maintained road is lined with small brass lanterns, each swinging off an individual pole. No expense has been spared to keep those who travel this road safe from the hoodlums that relish the darkness.  A street lantern and some charred foliage are here.

Vast estates tower over the huge Spurian wall towards the south. The well-to-do who live in these homes idle away their days, enjoying the luxury of time. Standing next to a very empty lantern pole, a small Flerian child insists in a plaintive wail, that he had nothing to do with the missing lantern. The well-dressed guard that interrogates him keeps pointing at a small sack on the ground and its obvious contents.  An open small burlap sack and a street lantern are here.

[Southern Avenue & Gorey Street.]

The boughs of a large apple tree hang over the well tended avenue. Below the beautiful tree stands a small fountain. Atop the fountain is an intricately carved Secian who appears to be dancing with the water as it splashes around her. Set in the marble base is a small plaque that reads, "For those who have gone before us." Many stand for a moment as they pass this way, giving thanks for the gift of life that is given by both the apple tree and the Secians of long ago. Large piles of dirt and broken stone lay on either side of the street as workmen ready the east and west alleys for expansion.  A street lantern, a Secian etched moonsilver door, a pair of open silver forged swinging doors, and a sign above the doors are here.

[Southern Avenue.]

Standing next to the large iron gate that separates the center of town from those of the elite class are several of the Spurian Guard. They are here to assist all who pass with the simple kindness of opening a gate, or the more important task of escorting those in need to the bank or market. A young looking cadet rubs wax into the stones of the city wall, his task is daunting, but one that will teach him discipline.  An open iron gate and a street lantern are here.

[Gateway.]

An elegant, carved wooden sign hangs above the ornate gateway set into the massive wall that divides Spurs Noble District from the Town Square. You can make out city guardsmen peering down attentively at all that approach from their posts atop the imposing wall. They seem to take a greater interest in this part of town, though there does not seem to be anything threatening enough here to warrant such attention.  A gilded silver plaque and a street lantern are here.

To the north, you can make out an ornately scrolled gateway set in the base of the imposing city wall. The refined roadway of Noble Way stretches out to the south. The cobblestones of the road are smooth and even. The attention to detail shown here is a dramatic change from some of the other parts of the city.  A street lantern is here.

An unusually large home, even for this part of town, lies off to the west. It seems as if one ambitious owner is slowly buying up the lots next to his and adding them to his own. Groundskeepers are at work in the surrounding gardens, trimming and raking, so intent on their work they do not bother to acknowledge the passing traffic on the road.  A street lantern is here.

Many grand, even ostentatious, homes line this stretch of Noble Way. Most of the residents here were fortunate enough to be born into the right families. Few that live in this area have ever actually had to work for a living. Glancing at the nameplates reveals many of the recognizable names of the Spur. Some of these names could almost be considered famous.  A street lantern is here.

Noble Way continues to wind its way among the rather modestly sized, but elegant, homes of the Spur's successful. Many a peasant farmer may live in homes larger than these, but none can match the quality found here. A peaceful, luxurious feeling pervades this part of town; perhaps it is the drifting floral scents wafting from the well-tended gardens.  A closed elegant black iron gate and a street lantern are here.

Gazing down each of the nearby private drives reveals a glimpse of a luxurious home, each a miniature estate in its own right. Short, stout walls and manicured hedges serve to keep out the riffraff and to protect the small, expensive gardens. Every detail has been attended to display the exotic plants, in all their pampered perfection.  A street lantern and a closed rosewood door are here.

Leaving the exceptionally wealthy estates of the Spurian nobility, Noble Way heads toward the Town Square to the northwest. Along the roadside can be seen the in-city homes of successful merchants and other wealthy citizens of the Spur. The homes display a slightly different style, perhaps they are not quite so restrained; a touch more exuberance and freedom with materials is displayed.  A street lantern is here.

[Intersection.]

The avenue comes to a fork, with Noble Way curving from south to the northwest. A side-street heading off to the east leads to an extremely well kept neighborhood that easily surpasses everything around it in splendor and magnificence. Everything, even the carefully pruned trees and the manicured shrubbery displays a desire for elegant perfection.  A street lantern is here.

[Noble Way.]

The entire avenue is composed of fine cobblestone, each level with its neighbor, providing a smooth ride for passing carriages and horses. The stones were customized by craftsmen, cut to order, rather than simply placed wherever they might fit. A few stately oaks and elms line the sides of the road, shading travelers during the daylight hours.  A street lantern is here.

Numerous trees lining the avenue serve as the dividing border between the majestic estates of the nobility and the lightly traveled roadway. The estates themselves are noticeably closer to the avenue than those to the south. However, they are no easier to access, still protected by their own guarding walls, some covered with ivy or colorful blooming vines.  A street lantern is here.

Occasional gates and driveways lead back into the well-kept estates of the city's nobility, breaking and adding interest to the defining plane of the walls lining Noble Way. The rest of the street seems to mimic the splendor of the estates beyond the wall. Swept and trimmed, the roadway exudes a simple, yet beautiful elegance.  A street lantern is here.

[Noble Crossroads.]

A small roadway bordered by flowering hedges bisects the wide avenue of Noble Way at a right angle, heading east to west.  A thick, sturdy sign stands just off to the side of a charming path, its large friendly letters intent on luring travelers into the city's premiere roadstay, the Gilded Lion Inn. The entrance is clearly marked and welcoming, extending off to the southeast.  A wooden sign and a street lantern are here.

Majestic elms continue to line this broad roadway, sheltering the avenue on both sides and further enhancing the grandiose atmosphere. Fronting the beautiful homes, cobbled paths edged with narrow flower beds meander through nearby private gardens. Though they appear wonderful places to spend an afternoon or take a picnic, the glances from those tending the estates makes it clear they are only for the invited.  A street lantern is here.

The occasional locked gate marks the entrance to some of the more hidden estates of Spurs nobility. From this broad avenue, little can be seen of their splendor. Behind the imposing gate recedes a proud drive, disappearing mysteriously into the trees. If not for the large imposing tower rising above the hedges it would be hard to discern anything was beyond the gate. It is apparent the residents do not wish to be disturbed.  A street lantern, a closed morbius door, and an open black iron gate are here.

[South Gate.]

A well-guarded gateway separates the city's residential district from the farmlands just beyond. Guards carefully eye all that enter or exit the city, beckoning gruffly to random travelers for a closer inspection. The structure of the guards' barracks is visible above the road to the west. A weathered wooden sign is posted by the gate.  An open stone gate, a wooden sign, a closed thick stone door, and a street lantern are here.

The area brightens.
[South gate.]

Through the gate lies the city of Spur, the major center of trade and civilization on the plains. The dusty road leading through the gates is well traveled, and walls of the city are in good repair. A small shack sits to the west of the road, during most times of the day a dusty coach can be seen waiting in front, its horses stomping with impatience to be gone. To the right of the door is a small window, its opening covered with metal bars. An old man, missing most of his teeth, waits patiently for the travelers to pay their fare, and then directs them into the waiting area. On the east side of the road a billowing multicolored tent has been erected, the hustle and bustle of merchants and customers can be seen coming and going at all times of the day.  A rainbow silk tent and an open iron gate are here.

Through the gate lies the city of Spur, the major center of trade and civilization on the plains. The dusty road leading through the gates is well traveled, and walls of the city are in good repair. A small shack sits to the west of the road, during most times of the day a dusty coach can be seen waiting in front, its horses stomping with impatience to be gone. To the right of the door is a small window, its opening covered with metal bars. An old man, missing most of his teeth, waits patiently for the travelers to pay their fare, and then directs them into the waiting area. On the east side of the road a billowing multicolored tent has been erected, the hustle and bustle of merchants and customers can be seen coming and going at all times of the day.

A hedge of spiky brambles forms a natural division from the lands and the swampy terrain to the south. Tall, limbless trees dot the horizon there, their bases lost in the misty depths of the gases hovering over the waters. Now and then a strange, growling sound echos up to the north, or an odd, high-pitched call of some unseen crow, probably feasting on a fallen creature hidden in the mists. The path curves away from the sounds, as popular choice has preferred to travel around the edges, rather than through the marshy sludge.

Circling around the northern base of a small hill, there lies the lapping edge of the swamp to the south. Small slimy creatures lie on the smooth stones near the water, darting into it at the speed of light as you near them with tiny splashes and echoing wakes blending into the small, gentle waves coming into the shore. Swarms of mosquitoes move along the land in unison, lending them the appearance of large, unified bodies hovering around for the next feast.

Ravens dark as pitch spread their feathers to a wing-span of nearly four feet, so large they are, as they quarrel over an abandoned mule carcass on the roadside breaks out. How final death seems, so casually nature simply encompasses the bodies of the fallen, through carrion hunters or moldy decay. Yet through death there be life again, any number of these ravens being sustained through this death, so they may live. Perhaps only to become sustenance for one of the swamp creatures, who, in turn, spends its life continuing the cycle.

The undergrowth thins here, and you are able to pick up traces of the path. To the east, where only a thin line of small trees mark the forest boundary, the marsh ends its reign and what appears to be a grassy plain begins.

The path becomes better defined, though it is still difficult to follow in the undergrowth, which has grown more dense. It is evident that the path at one time was a well-traveled route. Perhaps to the Spur?

The path progresses along, still skirting the eastern boundary of the forest. Other than the occasional noises common to woodlands, there is no evidence of higher forms of life. A squirrel streaks through the underbrush and up the trunk of a tree.

The trees are becoming taller, and their trunks larger, as you make your way along. The smaller birch and beech trees have given way to graceful elms. A low growl comes from amidst the trunks of the trees, but it is impossible to determine the direction.

Obvious paths: northeast southeast*.
[Path.]

Trees surround you on all sides; for a moment the path is lost to sight. Something slithers through the underbrush. Try as you might, you can't identify what it might have been. You feel uneasy, as though something is watching your every move.  An overgrown path is here.

Obvious paths: northeast southwest* northwest.
[Brambles.]

Struggling through the underbrush, you make your way down the small trail only to be brought up short by an impenetrable wall of brambles. Plump red berries hang from the small branches of the bushes, guarded by long, sharp thorns. On a low hanging branch overhead, a watchful owl stares at you with golden eyes.  A slightly hidden trail, an ethereal looking owl, and some fragrant red rose petals are here.

Winding through the trees, the path emerges from the dense foliage and continues northward. You begin to wonder if there is a way into the seemingly impenetrable western forest. A track, that looks to be one used by small animals, veers off to the side.

>[Riverside.]

The footbridge that once connected this path to its match on the other side of the overflowing rushing river is now nothing more then a few charred pilings. Tiny insects buzz around their remains, finding a comfortable new home. Lashed to the remains of one of the more sturdy pilings is a tall steel pole. Wrapped around the pole, and tied securely is a taut rope. Bobbing ever so lightly due to the strain of the riverboat, the rope holds tight.  A flowing river, a freshly painted sign, and some carved oak benches are here.
