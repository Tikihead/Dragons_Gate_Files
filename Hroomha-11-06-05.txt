Hiding behind the shadow of the moon, numerous trees and tent tops, a small village wears the black veil of night as it nestles itself behind the aura the eclipsed hour. A narrow trail ribbons itself through a forest maze of lifeless trees that frame the wayside of a rolling river. The wind fills the air with the scent of burning wood as its beckoning call echoes the eerie cry of howling wolves. Amidst the glowing light of lanterns, shady figures parade and dance through the heavy velvet blanket of night.  Some tall creepy oak trees, a glowing strand of star-shaped lights in the trees, a swirling vortex of shadows, and a decrepit faded wooden sign are here.

To the west, circles of festival goers sit around a bonfire, warming their hands as others wonder back and forth about the festival. The wind whines a slow, lingering song as a cobblestone path winds itself up to the entrance of a warping thatched roof cabin.  A festive old man smoking a pipe, a glowing orange candle in a jar, some decaying red leaves on the ground, and an open round shaped wooden door are here.

Colorful tents encircle a run down old pig-drawn wagon where festival goers line up in droves to purchase tickets and concessions. Amidst the hustle & bustle, sideshow harlequins entertain the crowd while the barker pitches, hawks, and ballyhoos passers-by from atop his platform. Gaudy, exaggerative banners hang over the tents and wagon, displaying the wonders that await customers. A pair of scorched faced go-blin-al firebreathers flank the entrance of the wagon, spewing forth an arch of flames overhead.  A small carved wooden sign, a colorful hand-painted canvas sideshow banner, a grotesque painted canvas tapestry, a fading yellowing cloth banner, a repulsive detailed burlap banner, an open giant black and orange striped tent flap, an open pitch black tent flap, an open crimson red tent flap, an open shadowy nebulous tent flap, and an open decrepit fading wooden wagon are here.

A thick swirling fog hangs over the ground, lazily creeping through the darkness of the tent. When the fog clears, a lone torch ignites seemingly by its own free will revealing rare and ancient finds adorning display shelves. A distinctly Frontacian voice beckons to you from the shadows of a curtained stage, "Be not afraid to gaze upon these wonders, but take heed not to touch them! You would not be the first to fall victim to their curses."  A tall petrified Penthanian, an ancient mysterious figure frozen in ice, a crooked carved pine ice-man sign, a dragon scale bound alchemist's journal, a closed official crested secret diary, a closed mahogany trimmed glass display case, a closed glass encased ivory pedestal, a shadow demon hand in a jar, a giant yellowing thick toenail clipping, a rotting duskwood stage with curtains, and an open shadowy nebulous tent flap are here.

Colorful tents encircle a run down old pig-drawn wagon where festival goers line up in droves to purchase tickets and concessions. Amidst the hustle & bustle, sideshow harlequins entertain the crowd while the barker pitches, hawks, and ballyhoos passers-by from atop his platform. Gaudy, exaggerative banners hang over the tents and wagon, displaying the wonders that await customers. A pair of scorched faced go-blin-al firebreathers flank the entrance of the wagon, spewing forth an arch of flames overhead.  A small carved wooden sign, a colorful hand-painted canvas sideshow banner, a grotesque painted canvas tapestry, a fading yellowing cloth banner, a repulsive detailed burlap banner, an open giant black and orange striped tent flap, an open pitch black tent flap, an open crimson red tent flap, an open shadowy nebulous tent flap, and an open decrepit fading wooden wagon are here.

[Southern Avenue & Gorey Street.]

The boughs of a large apple tree hang over the well tended avenue. Below the beautiful tree stands a small fountain. Atop the fountain is an intricately carved Secian who appears to be dancing with the water as it splashes around her. Set in the marble base is a small plaque that reads, "For those who have gone before us." Many stand for a moment as they pass this way, giving thanks for the gift of life that is given by both the apple tree and the Secians of long ago. Large piles of dirt and broken stone lay on either side of the street as workmen ready the east and west alleys for expansion.  A street lantern, an open Secian etched moonsilver door, a pair of open silver forged swinging doors, and a sign above the doors are here.

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.  A flowing white marble fountain, a marble statue of a Human, a shimmering marble statue of a Dragon, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a rosewood sign, a crisp gold lettered vellum notice, and a thick misty grey patch of swirling fog are here.

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.  A flowing white marble fountain, a marble statue of a Human, a shimmering marble statue of a Dragon, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a rosewood sign, a crisp gold lettered vellum notice, and a thick misty grey patch of swirling fog are here.

The elegant Hotel Royale towers above the street, its emerald door sparkling in the light. The patrons that stroll in and out are catered to, doors opened and closed for them, and baggage and packages carried by harried servants. The large Bank of Spur sits on the east side of the square. Its location close to the Royale is not a coincidence. A gold-trimmed door is proof of the success of this branch of the Spurian bank and those who run it.  An elegant gold-trimmed walnut door, an open emerald steel door, a street lantern, and a new rosewood sign pointing southeast are here.

Children and adults alike stand in line, some shivering from wetness after being dunked in the tank, awaiting their turn to dunk their friends and even their enemies. Slick wooden planks make up the foundation of the huge water tank that stands in the middle of this area. Tall glass panels rise up and enclose hundreds of gallons of crystal-clear water, giving a perfect glimpse into the depths of the tank itself. High above the water is a tiny chair on which an unfortunate soul can only sit and await a contestant with good aim to hit the tiny wooden target, only to be sent with a splash into the chilly water below.  A giant glass plated wooden dunking tank, a wooden bucket, a wooden bucket, a wet moldy wooden HOW TO sign, and an ominous twisted opal arch are here.

A small and uncomfortable, splintering wooden platform serves as a chair for the brave individual who waits here. The brown, sludgy water below laps continuously at the bottom of the stool. Occasionally, something pops up from the water and disappears as quickly as it came. Many people have gathered below to watch and try their luck at the targets that, once hit, will make the chair's support give way and send its occupant into the bubbling goop below!

Flitting from flower to flower, tiger-striped butterflies dance and swirl through the rich air of the season. A small group of Secians sit beside the billowing ivory tent drinking from the trumpet-shaped flower of sweet honeysuckle. Gardens of vibrantly adorned flowers and trees encircle the small tent in a ring of snapdragons, tiger lilies, mimosa, and lilacs. Taunting, splashing and laughter erupts from inside the tent which sets at the southeast corner of the winding path.

To the west, circles of festival goers sit around a bonfire, warming their hands as others wonder back and forth about the festival.

A festive old man smoking a pipe, a glowing orange candle in a jar, some decaying red leaves on the ground, and an open round shaped wooden door are here.
