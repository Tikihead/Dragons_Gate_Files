The area brightens.
[Fort Tarath.]

The giant fortification wall is divided into two main sections by huge doors.  These doors have been made from silver and look as though they could stand even the most fearsome battering ram.  Guards standing atop the walls eye you closely.  To the north you can see the business district.  An open silver-trimmed black drathain gate is here.

This area is illuminated.
You see the 1st black cat (wearing a small gold collar).
In the area are Marial the Secian (holding a flaming glowing holy symbol), Kang the Draco, Mao the Go-blin-al, Tharalia the San Elf, Maelstra the Drake, Kelthazod the San Elf, Binx the Secian, Wings the Noble Secian, Dray the Noble Thugian (holding a flaming massive dark blue wax candle), and Laetus the Secian.

You stand before a granite wall and large double gated doors. The walls are thick and finely crafted, and there seems to be a rather aged look about them.  The Gate is made of massive slabs of silver, while off to the left and right are the fort's impressive walls, able to withstand a rather large invasion or army if need be.  An open silver-trimmed black drathain gate is here.

Rough granite walls rise above you to the east and west. The area here is a bit rougher and seems to have been recently mined. Large veins of silver can be seen. Up overhead, on the western face of the gorge wall a large crack has appeared. Though large enough to fit a Thugian, the only thing exiting the crack is a steady stream of dripping water.

A wide rocky trail heads off into the mountainous terrain in an easterly direction. A large pile of rocks from an old landslide partially blocks passage in the other direction. Cracks and crevasses mar trail's surface, as runoff from the mountain snow makes its way to lower ground. Lush green bushes, and small trees dot the landscape, mingling with large boulders and smaller rocks.  A large pile of rocks is here.

A strong breeze blows off the mountains of the Great Divide. It both slows your climb and encourages your decent into the valley. The brush and trees lean noticeably towards the east, as if it was easier for them to just grow in the direction of the wind then to try and fight their natural instinct of reaching to the sun.

The trail winds around the large fallen tree. Smaller saplings, and fungus grows in the soil that is being enriched by the decaying tree. Several rocks dot the newly carved trail around the tree, making travel difficult. It is fairly certain many have cursed the falling of this great tree, and subsequent detour.

A small birds nest has been built within one of the larger cracks of the great tree. Twittering, chirping and the occasional rustling is quite noticeable from the nest as the babies all vie for whatever sustenance their parent brings. A quick flash red and mother bird flies off to find more worms.

A makeshift path has been created to circumvent the large tree that has fallen down and blocked the regular path. Lying on its side, the log stands two heads higher then the tallest Thugian.

Only the hardiest of life forms hold their own on the rocky steppes. Small cascades of icy water stream down the boulders and darken their surfaces. Tough lichen and scrub pines absorb nutrients from the mineral laden run-off. The sun shines brightly on the southern exposure of the trail, sheltered from the wind and freezing cold. Bright green oases of life sprout from rocky niches and the path is slippery where the green slimy growths cross it.

Huge boulders have created a bowl shaped depression in this sheltered hillock. A stand of scruffy trees continues to eke out a tenuous existence above the rocky outpost; their long tortured roots clinging desperately to what little soil is caught between the boulders. Prevailing winds from the mountaintop have caused the trunks to lean westward, the upper branches creating a canopy over the area.

Beneath the trees, many a caravan has stopped to water their draft animals and rest for the night. The area is strewn with animal refuse, bits of feed, and the resulting lingering aroma. The discarded feed and rubbish left by the travelers is picked over constantly by the hillock's inhabitants. In such a harsh environment, very little waste is left by the local scavengers.

A small spring fed stream meanders around the bowl, filling a pool on the western side of the path. A series of miniature waterfalls gurgle delightfully along the edges of the camp. The resulting pool is quite deep and crystal clear, even with the constant watering of pack animals. The flow of the spring must be constantly replenishing the pool, for no algae or slime clouds its depths.  A small crystal clear pool is here.

A lean-to built from odds and ends serves as a way station for exhausted travelers. Gathered firewood lines the lean-to's walls, and a small darkened pit smolders outside the opening. Inside the small, cramped lean-to, light filters in through the makeshift construction. The possibility of being snowed in and sheltering for a long period in this little hovel is not a welcome proposition.

Grey stepping stones, worn with time, bisect the overgrowth of weeds. They give you access to the untended flower beds that front the mansion. Waist high weeds crowd out what visible path remains. Your best bet seems to be to aim for the front door or the gate to the south.

Light filters in through a large paned glass window which, at one time must have glistened, but is now coated with the accumulation of years of dirt. A finely crafted staircase, its balustrade polished from many years of use, rises to the second floor unsupported.

Two gold brocade chairs rest against the eastern wall, a small oak table sits between them. Bumping up against either chair will get you a mouthful of choking dust.

The thin yet distinct carving of a female Anthian standing sideways, her wings flared, forms the carved doors of a cabinet leaning against the cold stone wall. Opening the cherry construct requires for the bird-creature's wings to be pulled away from its body. This would explain the agony carved into her face.  An old dried snakeskin coil is here.

The platform, hanging haphazardly by pulleys from only two of its four corners, is crafted from loose sheets of ring mail.

The floor stands agape here; a large hole resulting from the cedar floor boards being ripped up. Not far from the destruction is a collection of newly constructed heartwood coffins, their outer hulls inscribed with arcane and runic symbols. The closest container sits slightly ajar, offering the curious explorer a look within...   A cold stone staircase is here.

The cedar heartwood planks under the nearest cage door bear many deep scratch marks, a futile attempt to escape the prison.   A cold stone staircase is here.

Concentric circles of fire-blackened stone form an eerie pattern on the floor beneath a suspended platform. The platform, hanging haphazardly by pulleys from only two of its four corners, is crafted from loose sheets of ring mail. Each ring is large enough to allow your finger to pass through, as well as the searing heat of the fire. The ring mail still holds strands of hair and rotting scales.  A cold stone staircase is here.

Concentric circles of fire-blackened stone form an eerie pattern on the floor beneath a suspended platform. The platform, hanging haphazardly by pulleys from only two of its four corners, is crafted from loose sheets of ring mail. Each ring is large enough to allow your finger to pass through, as well as the searing heat of the fire. The ring mail still holds strands of hair and rotting scales.  A cold stone staircase is here.

The thin yet distinct carving of a female Anthian standing sideways, her wings flared, forms the carved doors of a cabinet leaning against the cold stone wall. Opening the cherry construct requires for the bird-creature's wings to be pulled away from its body. This would explain the agony carved into her face.

Small knobs adorn the wall on either side of the circular staircase. Upon further inspection, these knobs are actually small ebony hands, palms up and fingers slightly curved into a grasping position. The minute appendages line the walls high and low, some still holding long iron pokers and malleable steel paddles, others serving as hooks for three-pronged barbed whips.  A cold spiraling stone staircase, a small mottled marble mortar, and a faded orange steelwood leaf are here.

Stepping inside one of the cramped cells offers a perspective few wish to retain. Black iron manacles, hanging from chains imbedded in the walls, clank against each other hauntingly. The heavy, metallic smell of blood permeates the cell. Any view that might had been offered by the window has been squelched by the boards nailed over it. 

This area is illuminated.
You see the 1st black cat (wearing a small gold collar).
In the area are Marial the Secian (holding a flaming glowing holy symbol), Kang the Draco, Maelstra the Drake, Binx the Secian, Wings the Noble Secian, Dray the Noble Thugian (holding a flaming massive dark blue wax candle), and Laetus the Secian.

Concentric circles of fire-blackened stone form an eerie pattern on the floor beneath a suspended platform.

Each ring is large enough to allow your finger to pass through, as well as the searing heat of the fire. The ring mail still holds strands of hair and rotting scales.

A green veined marble chair occupies the center position in this portion of the tower. The armrests contain thick leather straps, obviously designed for holding the occupant of the chair in place securely, and sharp spikes where the wrists would rest. Similar restraints are found where the legs would be, and a larger leather binding hangs where a head would be positioned. Directly under the armrests hang rusted copper buckets.  A cold spiraling stone staircase is here.

This area is illuminated.
You see the 1st black cat (wearing a small gold collar) and the 1st chain-rattling executioner.
In the area are Marial the Secian (holding a flaming glowing holy symbol), Kang the Draco, Maelstra the Drake, Binx the Secian, Wings the Noble Secian, Dray the Noble Thugian (holding a flaming massive dark blue wax candle), and Laetus the Secian.

Concentric circles of fire-blackened stone form an eerie pattern on the floor beneath a suspended platform. The platform, hanging haphazardly by pulleys from only two of its four corners, is crafted from loose sheets of ring mail. Each ring is large enough to allow your finger to pass through, as well as the searing heat of the fire. The ring mail still holds strands of hair and rotting scales.  A cold stone staircase is here.

This area is illuminated.

In the area are Marial the Secian (holding a flaming glowing holy symbol), Kang the Draco, Maelstra the Drake, Binx the Secian, Wings the Noble Secian, Dray the Noble Thugian (holding a flaming massive dark blue wax candle), and Laetus the Secian.

Small knobs adorn the wall on either side of the circular staircase. Upon further inspection, these knobs are actually small ebony hands, palms up and fingers slightly curved into a grasping position. The minute appendages line the walls high and low, some still holding long iron pokers and malleable steel paddles, others serving as hooks for three-pronged barbed whips.  A cold spiraling stone staircase is here.

Concentric circles of fire-blackened stone form an eerie pattern on the floor beneath a suspended platform. The platform, hanging haphazardly by pulleys from only two of its four corners, is crafted from loose sheets of ring mail. Each ring is large enough to allow your finger to pass through, as well as the searing heat of the fire. The ring mail still holds strands of hair and rotting scales.

A green veined marble chair occupies the center position in this portion of the tower. The armrests contain thick leather straps, obviously designed for holding the occupant of the chair in place securely, and sharp spikes where the wrists would rest. Similar restraints are found where the legs would be, and a larger leather binding hangs where a head would be positioned. Directly under the armrests hang rusted copper buckets.  A cold spiraling stone staircase and a closed dirty lionskin pouch are here.

Bluesteel beams form the infrastructure of the conical roof in this top floor prison room. The criss-crossing network of beams high above serves as the anchor point for a dozen swaying manacle chains. Unlike the rest of the tower, the inward sloped floor in the prison is comprised of uneven cobblestone. A large grate sits like a waiting maw in the center of the floor, ready to consume any fluid that comes its way.   A cold stone staircase is here.

Concentric circles of fire-blackened stone form an eerie pattern on the floor beneath a suspended platform. The platform, hanging haphazardly by pulleys from only two of its four corners, is crafted from loose sheets of ring mail. Each ring is large enough to allow your finger to pass through, as well as the searing heat of the fire. The ring mail still holds strands of hair and rotting scales.  A cold stone staircase is here.

[Noble Way.]

Leaving the exceptionally wealthy estates of the Spurian nobility, Noble Way heads toward the Town Square to the northwest. Along the roadside can be seen the in-city homes of successful merchants and other wealthy citizens of the Spur. The homes display a slightly different style, perhaps they are not quite so restrained; a touch more exuberance and freedom with materials is displayed.  A street lantern is here.

[Noble Way.]

Gazing down each of the nearby private drives reveals a glimpse of a luxurious home, each a miniature estate in its own right. Short, stout walls and manicured hedges serve to keep out the riffraff and to protect the small, expensive gardens. Every detail has been attended to display the exotic plants, in all their pampered perfection.  A street lantern and a closed rosewood door are here.

Noble Way continues to wind its way among the rather modestly sized, but elegant, homes of the Spur's successful. Many a peasant farmer may live in homes larger than these, but none can match the quality found here. A peaceful, luxurious feeling pervades this part of town; perhaps it is the drifting floral scents wafting from the well-tended gardens.  A closed elegant black iron gate and a street lantern are here.

Many grand, even ostentatious, homes line this stretch of Noble Way. Most of the residents here were fortunate enough to be born into the right families. Few that live in this area have ever actually had to work for a living. Glancing at the nameplates reveals many of the recognizable names of the Spur. Some of these names could almost be considered famous.  A street lantern is here.

[Noble Way.]

An unusually large home, even for this part of town, lies off to the west. It seems as if one ambitious owner is slowly buying up the lots next to his and adding them to his own. Groundskeepers are at work in the surrounding gardens, trimming and raking, so intent on their work they do not bother to acknowledge the passing traffic on the road.  A street lantern is here.

To the north, you can make out an ornately scrolled gateway set in the base of the imposing city wall. The refined roadway of Noble Way stretches out to the south. The cobblestones of the road are smooth and even. The attention to detail shown here is a dramatic change from some of the other parts of the city.  A street lantern is here.

[Gateway.]

An elegant, carved wooden sign hangs above the ornate gateway set into the massive wall that divides Spurs Noble District from the Town Square. You can make out city guardsmen peering down attentively at all that approach from their posts atop the imposing wall. They seem to take a greater interest in this part of town, though there does not seem to be anything threatening enough here to warrant such attention.  A street lantern, an open iron gate, and a gilded silver plaque are here.

[Southern Avenue.]

Standing next to the large iron gate that separates the center of town from those of the elite class are several of the Spurian Guard. They are here to assist all who pass with the simple kindness of opening a gate, or the more important task of escorting those in need to the bank or market. A young looking cadet rubs wax into the stones of the city wall, his task is daunting, but one that will teach him discipline.  An open iron gate and a street lantern are here.

[Southern Avenue & Gorey Street.]

The boughs of a large apple tree hang over the well tended avenue. Below the beautiful tree stands a small fountain. Atop the fountain is an intricately carved Secian who appears to be dancing with the water as it splashes around her. Set in the marble base is a small plaque that reads, "For those who have gone before us." Many stand for a moment as they pass this way, giving thanks for the gift of life that is given by both the apple tree and the Secians of long ago. Large piles of dirt and broken stone lay on either side of the street as workmen ready the east and west alleys for expansion.  A street lantern, an open Secian etched moonsilver door, a pair of open silver forged swinging doors, and a sign above the doors are here.

Vast estates tower over the huge Spurian wall towards the south. The well-to-do who live in these homes idle away their days, enjoying the luxury of time. Standing next to a very empty lantern pole, a small Flerian child insists in a plaintive wail, that he had nothing to do with the missing lantern. The well-dressed guard that interrogates him keeps pointing at a small sack on the ground and its obvious contents.  An open small burlap sack, a street lantern, and a lantern are here.

Southern Avenue leads between the center of Spur and the homes of the prosperous and wealthy.

[Town Square South.]

The outward appearance of the people here seems a bit classier. Rich clothing and large coin purses are prevalent amongst the travelers. In fact, many of the folk heading into Town Square from the south are accompanied by large bodyguards to assure their safety. The well maintained road is lined with small brass lanterns, each swinging off an individual pole.  A street lantern and a fluffy white layer of snow are here.

[Town Square.]

The elegant Hotel Royale towers above the street, its emerald door sparkling in the light. The patrons that stroll in and out are catered to, doors opened and closed for them, and baggage and packages carried by harried servants. The large Bank of Spur sits on the east side of the square. Its location close to the Royale is not a coincidence. A gold-trimmed door is proof of the success of this branch of the Spurian bank and those who run it.  An elegant gold-trimmed walnut door, an open emerald steel door, a street lantern, a new rosewood sign pointing southeast, and a fluffy white layer of snow are here.

Two large Thugian guards stand sentinel on each side of the doors to the main branch of the Bank of Spur. Elegant furnishings adorn the office. Polished oak and gold filigree emphasize the wealth that abounds in this establishment. Well-dressed tellers stand ready to help you store your money safely or to reduce your coinage to more manageable form.  An elegant gold-trimmed walnut door, a wooden sign, and a bright wooden sign are here.

>[Bank.]

Two large Thugian guards stand sentinel on each side of the doors to the main branch of the Bank of Spur. Elegant furnishings adorn the office. Polished oak and gold filigree emphasize the wealth that abounds in this establishment. Well-dressed tellers stand ready to help you store your money safely or to reduce your coinage to more manageable form.  An elegant gold-trimmed walnut door, a wooden sign, and a bright wooden sign are here.

This room is illuminated.
In the room are Marial the Secian, Kang the Draco, Maelstra the Drake, Binx the Secian, Wings the Noble Secian, Dray the Noble Thugian (holding a flaming massive dark blue wax candle), and Laetus the Secian.

>[Town Square.]

The elegant Hotel Royale towers above the street, its emerald door sparkling in the light. The patrons that stroll in and out are catered to, doors opened and closed for them, and baggage and packages carried by harried servants. The large Bank of Spur sits on the east side of the square. Its location close to the Royale is not a coincidence. A gold-trimmed door is proof of the success of this branch of the Spurian bank and those who run it.  An elegant gold-trimmed walnut door, an open emerald steel door, a street lantern, a new rosewood sign pointing southeast, and a fluffy white layer of snow are here.

This area is illuminated.

>[Town Square Center.]

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.  A flowing white marble fountain, a marble statue of a Human, a shimmering marble statue of a Dragon, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a rosewood sign, a crisp gold lettered vellum notice, a fluffy white layer of snow, a glistening white snow fort, a pile of sparkling snow balls, an open gold-trimmed gold chest, and a damaged heavy suit of bark training armor are here.

This area is illuminated.
You see the 1st city guard mage and the 2nd city guard mage.
In the area are Vermithrax the Drake (flying 10 feet above you), Thistlethorn the Flerian, Callik the Noble Fir Elf, Mael the Thugian, Aethelwulf the Leuian, Telde the Drag-al, Kavita the Noble Secian, Tyran the Novice Anthian (seated), and Serisius the Novice Flerian.

[Town Square North.]

The traffic on the northern street heading away from town square is an eclectic bunch.  Those who belong to the guilds to the north travel in packs on their way to and from guild events.  It is not unusual to see a group of armored fighters passing a group of robed clerics, each heading in the opposite direction. The large temple of Rinanni rises to the north, its white marble almost glowing in the light.  A street lantern and a fluffy white layer of snow are here.

Beds of wildflowers line the carefully placed cobblestones along this street. A pair of love birds, cooing in delight, sit upon a white marble bench. The giggles and laughs of a pair of trysting lovers echoes from the room in the Traveler's Hostel to the east. It is certain that Rinanni looks down upon this scene with delight.  A white marble bench and a street lantern are here.

A peaceful bliss pervades the very core of this guilded path. Below a large oak tree a couple of Rinannian priestesses sing lightly in Secti. Several merchants pause to listen to the song. Even a few hardened warriors cannot help but smile at the sweet melody.  A large oak tree, an open dragon-etched emerald door, and a street lantern are here.

The distant glimmer from a temple made of white marble and pearl catches your eye. An intricate gilded iron gate and a small winding path are all that separate you from the dazzling temple of Rinanni. Majestic marble statues of doves in flight stand on either side of the gate. The gaze of their peaceful eyes seems to follow your every movement.  An open intricately gilded iron gate, a pair of pure white marble dove statues, and a street lantern are here.

A large stone building rises just to the east of Northern Avenue. These barracks house those known as Dread Knights. It is not unusual to see patrols of this elite group heading down the street towards Town Square. One would hope their presence would allow everyone to live in peace. If only they would stop fingering their swords all the time, you might believe it yourself.  A street lantern is here.

Northern Avenue ends at a gateway set within the massive city walls. On the other side of the gate are the Guild Halls. Those who pass through accept the bond of peace that the Guilds impose on all who desire their services. On either side of the gate guards stand at attention saluting all those who pass by.  An open iron gate, an open thick stone door, and a street lantern are here.

The massive building of the Merchant's Guild looms over a vast part of the guild district. The activity at the main door of the guild is mind numbing as hundreds of citizens and merchants alike rush in and out of the guild to handle their business. While the governor has control over the city guard, many claim it is the Merchant's Guild that runs the city of Spur.  An open exquisite polished mahogany door and a street lantern are here.

Members of the Spurian Merchant's Guild are among the wealthiest individuals in the realm, and they obviously aren't afraid to show it. A luxurious red carpet with gold embroidered trim pads the floor of the guild lobby. Overstuffed wing-back chairs are arranged around a marble fireplace, a waiting area for those with appointments to see one of the merchants. Personal guards stand vigil at the doorway, keeping a watchful eye on all who pass. A heavy velvet curtain separates the lobby from the activity within the guild hall.
