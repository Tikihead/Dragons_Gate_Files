[Elindale's Temple, Altar Room.]

The hum of busy bees and hummingbirds add a tone of unity to the soft chants of the priests and murmurings of those here to offer up the sacrifices and tithes to the great Goddess, Elindale. Several monks wearing floor length robes sit in silence, with the occasional clasped hands rising up in a particularly vibrant part of prayer. The altar itself is composed of growing flowers, the tiny buds enclosing gems and gold alike. Around the base of the altar grows a ring of mushrooms, vibrantly cloaked in red with white spots dotting the umbrellas.  A blooming altar of flowers and a red and white ring of mushrooms are here.

This room is illuminated.
In the room are Aradeia the Leuian (seated) and Lief the Fir Elf (seated).
Obvious exits: southeast*.

The hum of busy bees and hummingbirds add a tone of unity to the soft chants of the priests and murmurings of those here to offer up the sacrifices and tithes to the great Goddess, Elindale. Several monks wearing floor length robes sit in silence, with the occasional clasped hands rising up in a particularly vibrant part of prayer. The altar itself is composed of growing flowers, the tiny buds enclosing gems and gold alike. Around the base of the altar grows a ring of mushrooms, vibrantly cloaked in red with white spots dotting the umbrellas.  A blooming altar of flowers and a red and white ring of mushrooms are here.

While the tree appears gigantic from the outside, it still is nothing compared to the impression of being on the inside. Hollow branches large enough to pass a drake branch out here, the surfaces smooth, but in a most curious way. It is apparent that no tools were used to create these passageways, yet there is no evidence to give one the impression that the passageways formed over a long period of time. The branches have grown in this manner intentionally, quite unlike any plantlife found anywhere on the land.

A large tapestry lines the outside wall of the passageway, most impressive in that it is not made of fabric, but of vines as tiny as thick hairs, growing in a weave. The delicate shadings of the plants is perfectly natural, and as the eye becomes unfocused, a picture of a diminutive, beautiful maiden sits amongst a foresty background. The wall opposite of this magnificent tapestry is lined with portraits of prominent temple leaders, the colors vibrant, bringing a life-like sense to the frames. The eyes of the maiden in the tapestry seem to follow you, staring directly as you pass, boring into your soul.  A vellum portrait, a canvas portrait, a suede portrait, some unfinished portraits, and a carefully painted silk screen are here.

A staircase here seems to have some enchantment, judging by the strange appearance of unicorns, bears and owls on the lower steps. Strange, due to the fact that they don't appear carved, painted, or put there by any hand-made means. It is as if the glyphs grew into the wood itself. Mysterious symbols are scattered throughout the portraits, which shimmer with a golden whisper as they are approached.

Swollen beyond its banks, the once small creek is now a rushing overflowing river. What used to be the charred footbridge is now a safe haven for fish well down river, nothing left of its structure. Set well into the bank of the river is a long steel pole. Lashed to the pole is a heavy rope. The voice of the riverboat captain can be heard echoing across the water, taking command and moving his cargo.

A soft yellowish glow radiates from inside the sapphire entwined crystal arch as the faint murmur of chanting echoes in the air. The crystal archway is the entrance to a modest black marble building, which is intricately inlaid with sapphire designs of zigzags and lines. The walls of the Guild of Magi peak at a triangular rooftop, where a sapphire griffin sits as a sentinel at its zenith against the backdrop of the sky.  Some fragrant crimson roses, a pair of filigree crafted iron benches, a glowing rune inscribed cobblestone walkway, and a sapphire entwined crystal arch are here.

An enormous golden dragon, with outstretched wings ready for flight, climbs its way up the tower walls. Its sinuous tail wraps protectively around the tower's base, as intricately carved claws dig into the stone. The majestic creature's head curves around the tower's top, its mouth is opened in a permanent battle roar. Massive blue ruby eyes gaze down upon all who travel through Emjedah.

On wispy wings, the wind carries the dulcet scent of wild roses, as the whispered conversations of resting townspeople echoes the lulling rhythm of a constant song.

[Emjedah, Imperial Gate House.]

A massive black stone wall stands guard over the west side of Emjedah. Uniformed sentries pace slowly along the wall walk, as majestic flags of red, black, and blue rise high above two triple-turret Hawk Towers. The flags thrash crisply with the mountain's windy exhale. A steadfast stream of twisting rapids curls around the outer surface of the wall. The white-capped water cuts a treacherous path through rocks and ledges while it winds itself under an intricately carved stone drawbridge.  A moonsilver lettered teak sign, a moonsilver lettered teak Notice Of Exiles, a moonsilver lettered teak Notice Of Exiles #2, and an intricately carved stone drawbridge are here.

>                        You have visualized the following locations
                        -------------------------------------------

                                    Visualization #1 is:
The towering trees of the forest begin their ascension of the large mountain seen from the open plains of New South Lake. The root holds are precarious, as the mountain's face is especially steep on the northern side. The muddy path concludes in front of a sheer stone wall covered with verdant patches of green moss. A numbing breeze blows outward from the depths a massive cavern mouth, as if the mountain itself was exhaling ice-chilled breath. Deep-cut symbols grace the sides of the cavern entrance. They appear to be recently completed, as time, water, and weather have not yet dulled the sharp lines of the cuts.

                                    Visualization #2 is:
Four sturdy walls and a roof of woven branches enclose this small tavern. From the forest floor, winding their way around the trunk of the Mother Tree, a set of intricately railed steps serve as the entrance and exit of the town of Treehaven. Strangers arriving at the top of the steps find themselves under the watchful eye of patrons seated at tables positioned about the light, airy room. A set of oak steps lead up to the new Council chambers.

                                    Visualization #3 is:
An abundant gallery of paintings depicting sacrifices and hold offerings to their god suspend from crooked iron nails. Resting beside each painting, cold black iron braziers appear to hold burned blood and bone. A few charred, blackened pieces can be found in them. Several iron chains hang along the walls of the sacrificial chamber. Along the floor, intricately placed colored slate tiles are coated in dust covered dried blood. Centering the room is a raised platform accessible through a flight of stairs. Upon this raised formation rests an altar inlaid with rows and rows of teeth.

>[Treehaven, Main Platform]

The branches of this tree have begun to grow through the wooden platform. The limbs have begun to twist and turn, forming their own natural base. Soft leaves create a cushion and boast several small buds. The former bank is almost completely covered by vines and moss. Intricately crafted stairs lead from the platform to the new building that resides in the upper branches.  An open door and a freshly painted wooden sign are here.

>[Treehaven, Main Platform]

Leaves and small twigs spot the walkway as it hugs against the trunk of the Mother Tree. New sprouts from the branches above hang softly over the wooden planks, shading it slightly. A large building rests gently against the trunk in the limbs above, nestled as though it grew from within the tree itself.  An oak ladder is here.

This area is illuminated.
You see the 1st shadowless fir elf child.

>[Treehaven, Main Platform]

New wooden planks fit side by side creating the walkway that extends proudly upon the reconstructed supports. The view of the forest to the northwest is quite panoramic, despite the burnt spikes of trees in the midst. A staircase here seems to have some enchantment, judging by the strange appearance of unicorns, bears and owls on the lower steps. Strange, due to the fact that they don't appear carved, painted, or put there by any hand-made means. It is as if the glyphs grew into the wood itself. Mysterious symbols are scattered throughout the portraits, which shimmer with a golden whisper as they are approached.

This area is illuminated.
Obvious paths: north* south* northwest*.

>[Elindale's Temple.]

This is the main entrance of a Temple of Elindale, the inside walls perfectly smooth with glowing magickal symbols upon the surfaces. The enormity of this tree becomes apparent as one travels up the stairs to the northwest. The air holds a fresh, new ambiance, pleasantly scented with sweet sap and rich, earthly undertones.  Some glowing magickal symbols and a brown oak staircase are here.

Encircling the innards of this tree, these steps coil clock-wise to the top, the entire environment one single living thing. There are no cracks, no signs of building. Tapestries on the wall appear life-like, suspended with no visible attachments.  A breathtaking tapestry is here.

A diminutive niche in the wall provides shelter to a small family of flying squirrels. Just inside sit the young, comfortably settled into the soft bedding the parents have gathered up. A breeze carries their tiny chitters to your ears, revealing that the niche is somehow connected to the outside world as well.  A niche in the wall is here.

This room is illuminated.
Obvious exits: southeast* southwest*.
[Elindale's Temple.]

A large tapestry lines the outside wall of the passageway, most impressive in that it is not made of fabric, but of vines as tiny as thick hairs, growing in a weave. The delicate shadings of the plants is perfectly natural, and as the eye becomes unfocused, a picture of a diminutive, beautiful maiden sits amongst a foresty background. The wall opposite of this magnificent tapestry is lined with portraits of prominent temple leaders, the colors vibrant, bringing a life-like sense to the frames. The eyes of the maiden in the tapestry seem to follow you, staring directly as you pass, boring into your soul.  A vellum portrait, a canvas portrait, a suede portrait, some unfinished portraits, and a carefully painted silk screen are here.

This room is illuminated.
Obvious exits: southwest* northwest*.
[Elindale's Temple.]

While the tree appears gigantic from the outside, it still is nothing compared to the impression of being on the inside. Hollow branches large enough to pass a drake branch out here, the surfaces smooth, but in a most curious way. It is apparent that no tools were used to create these passageways, yet there is no evidence to give one the impression that the passageways formed over a long period of time. The branches have grown in this manner intentionally, quite unlike any plantlife found anywhere on the land.

This room is illuminated.
Obvious exits: north* northeast* southeast* south* southwest* west* northwest*.
[Elindale's Temple, Altar Room.]

The hum of busy bees and hummingbirds add a tone of unity to the soft chants of the priests and murmurings of those here to offer up the sacrifices and tithes to the great Goddess, Elindale. Several monks wearing floor length robes sit in silence, with the occasional clasped hands rising up in a particularly vibrant part of prayer. The altar itself is composed of growing flowers, the tiny buds enclosing gems and gold alike. Around the base of the altar grows a ring of mushrooms, vibrantly cloaked in red with white spots dotting the umbrellas.  A blooming altar of flowers and a red and white ring of mushrooms are here.
