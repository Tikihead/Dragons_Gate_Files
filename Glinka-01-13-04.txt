[Gateway.]

You are just inside the gateway between the Justice District and the Town Square. Most of those heading into the Justice District have a grim look about them. Then again, it could just be the chains. A small sign stands off to the side.  An open iron gate, a street lantern, and a wooden sign are here.

This area is illuminated.
In the area are Midnight the Noble Secian and Zackie the Secian.
Obvious paths: southeast* south*.

You follow Midnight southeast...

[Law Road & Shoteron Way.]

Law Road from the south and Shoteron Way from the east join before turning toward Town Square to the northwest. If one stays at this location long enough, they see the irony of these two roads joining. Most who are escorted south along Law Road are the criminals and ne'er-do-wells of the Spur, while those travel along Shoteron Way are the upper class residents whom live further east. Two office building, the City Planners Office and the Archmage's office stand on opposite sides of the road, each one neatly kept and freshly painted.  A street lantern and a closed morbius door are here.

[Shoteron Way.]

A shadowy black twisted free form metal sculpture stands on a small patch of grass at the beginning of Shoteron Way. Its unique design catches the light of both the sun and the moon. Below the memorial are several small items that have been left in passing. The well-manicured cobblestone path shows signs that it is well traveled, with enough room for even the largest cart or Leuian family.  A street lantern is here.

[Shoteron Way.]

A low hedge grows between the Spurian Wall and the street. Flowers bloom on the hedge, and cheer up what might be a dreary view. Two guards lean over the tall wall and call down greetings to those who pass. At any time of the day, one may pass a Fir Elf on the way to market, or a Hithual stumbling home to sleep.  A street lantern and an open large wrought iron gate are here.

[Cobblestone Lane.]

Several well placed street lanterns line the well kept cobblestone path. A towering oak tree sits off to the side of the path. Its leaves blow and twist displaying its various mint green colors. Nestled in its branches several blue birds call back and forth to one another in song. Floating grey clouds pass by overhead.  An open large wrought iron gate, a colorful cobblestone path, and a glowing tall wrought iron street lantern are here.

[Cobblestone Lane.]

Adjacent to the street lanterns, two wooden benches lay next to the cobblestone path. A fluttering yellow and orange butterfly flits back and forth amongst large lilac trees displaying their purple hues. A gentle breeze picks up the sweet scent of the purple flowers and carries it across the lane.  A colorful cobblestone path, a glowing tall wrought iron street lantern, a rosewood bench, and a flowering lilac tree are here.

[Raine Estates.]

Several majestic willow trees, with their long drooping branches, stand at the top of a gently sloping hill. A slight wind blows among the trees and grass in this flowery meadow while a trickling stream flows among the boulders at the bottom of a small hill. Home to many small animals, patches of tall grass and several bushes grow around the stream.  A large willow tree is here.

The scent of fresh, green trodden grass, and the gentle rustling of the golden leaves overhead delighted the senses. On the edge of the property, a waterfall trickles over an embankment of several large white stones into a light green pool below. The glistening water travels down a slow moving stream caring fallen leaves and grass.  A glistening stream is here.

[Mystical Garden.]

The garden is surrounded by a non-symmetrical stone wall done in earthen shades, yellow roses and wild vines clinging to its stony face. A small mosaic just barely peeking out from the mass of flowers and leaves can be viewed as the sun rises. In the midst of it all, a large willow tree spreads its massive branches over the area, colorful paper lanterns hanging within. A lush blanket of natural carpet, deep green clover spouting from the ground to form a soft pathway. The edge of the pond reaches to the edge of the path, the beginning of a breathtaking garden starting here. In the distance the calls of ducks and other wildlife can be heard. From one of the tallest tree branches, the echoing hum of busy bees sound from a golden beehive, the scent of honey filling the air with a delightful aroma.  Some earthen stone wall and an open vine entwined silver gate are here.

[Pathway Garden.]

Cheerful laughter can be heard echoing through this open air garden as wisps of bright colors flash past. Secians run and play a game of mid-flight tag, merrily flying past one another as their rainbow wings become a blur. Gray flecked white marble benches line a small, deep blue pool filled with cool, tranquil waters with the exception of a stray duck making a crash-landing. Various sorts of flowers from every imaginable part of Aradath sprout in full bloom in all areas, nearly overtaking the pathway. A red rosebush stands out in particular, well kept, the flowers bloom brilliantly opening to the sun. The scent of delicate floral mixed with fresh grass and tall, green leafed trees makes for an intoxicatingly fresh aroma.  A red rosebush is here.

[Entryway.]

A smooth gray marble floor flecked with white spreads out beneath you. A constant, calming sound of trickling water can be heard from a small matching marble fountain in the center. The fresh water trickles down from the three-tiered fountain spreading over little black and white pebbles in the basin. Pillows of bright colors, large and small, line the corner of the room, providing an inviting place for conversations and relaxation. A winding staircase with a thick wrought iron railing wraps its way upwards, only to grow hazy with wisps of mist as it reaches the ceiling. A few carved marble benches line the fountain for those that wish to sit next to it, the feet of the seating resembling that of a clawed Dragon. Affixed to one of the walls is a small plaque made of a blackened silvery-gray metal.  A blackened silver-trimmed plaque, a tall flowing marble fountain, and a mist covered cobblestone pathway are here.

[Fire.]

Worn stones form the walls and floor of this room; veined in ruby, the stones feel warm on the soles of your feet, glowing with their radiating heat. The air shimmers with the warmth emanating from the center of the area. A huge gold lined pit sits directly in the middle, magical red and amber flames dance within it. Roughly carved wooden logs surround the blaze, allowing one to bask in the warmth of the flames. Shadows dance along the walls, forming the perfect backdrop of mystery. Charred-ended sticks are scattered about, some with the blackened remains of marshmallows and other roasted foods.  Some glowing mystical red swirled amber flames and a golden fire pit are here.

[Air.]

Only two walls remain of this once large room. A few stray blades of grass protrude through the stone floor, sprouting between the cracks. You can still make out what was once a glorious mosaic, depicting a fluffy white cloud puffing a breath of swirled white and sapphire wind. A warm breeze flows through the area, and whispers through the four supportive blue sapphire pillars holding aloft a highly polished dome roof. A few cracks in the silver dome allow rays of warm sunlight to enter, creating chaotic patterns on the floor as the sun moves throughout the day. Suddenly a myriad of bubbles surround you, dancing through the air entering from cracks within the wall. The bubbles pop as they touch any furniture or person and vanish from sight. Soft feather stuffed white and blue silk pillows lay in groups around the room, surprisingly untouched from the elements and popping bubbles.  A pile of blue and white feathered pillows is here.

[Water.]

A highly detailed mural in various shades of turquoise and amethyst depicts the rolling ocean. White sea foam spreads across the edges of the waves into the clear sky of the elaborate wall paintings. The floor is made of a thick glass, underneath a pool of water swirls creating the illusion of being out to sea. A few fan-tailed fish swim through the underground pool and fade away from sight to some unknown area. A gentle breeze blows through the room at sporadic times, refreshing and soothing. Stray patches of white sand litter the floor, leading to their dune piles residing in the corners, creating a comfortable place to sit or build a castle.  A closed amethyst swirled marble chest is here.

[Earth.]

Overhead, the canopy of deep green leaves allows for only a little bit of sun to shine through, dappling the area in patches light. The dark brown trees seem ancient and impossibly huge. Vines climb across their branches, connecting each to the next. Lush vegetation grows around their bases; broad leafed ferns, and tropical flowers. A few rare copper tinted flowers sprout near the tallest of the dark trees. Bright jewel colored hummingbirds dart around cheerfully, not seeming to mind any noise or visitors. The roots of the largest tree in the center of the grove form a small depression, filled with the blue green waters accumulated during rainfall. Small stone benches rest in the nooks of the roots around the pool. Copper basins next to them are filled with refreshments.  A majestic willow tree and an ancient tarnished copper basin are here.

[Night.]

Upon entering this pitch black painted circular room it is difficult to find your bearings at first. Much darker in hue than the rest of the areas, the decor has been styled to represent a midnight sky.  An ebony archway barely visible rests on the far wall, magick surrounding it, preventing visibility into the area on the other side. Astonishing platinum stars inlaid into the ceiling flicker in the low pillar candle light.  Magickal platinum flamed candles made of deep black beeswax rest upon small round ebony tables.  Light fluffy pillows shaped to resemble clouds are stacked in three corners, dark blue and indigo in shade.  A few warm fleece blankets are stacked upon a black marble shelf carved into the wall, allowing visitors to keep warm even on the coldest of nights.  A winding wrought iron railed staircase, a closed smooth black marble box dotted with stars, and a smooth ebony archway are here.

[Day.]

Bright light fills this room at all times of day, reminding of pure, natural sunlight.  The rays of illumination have a brassy tint to them, creating a warm hued glow upon the simple furniture of this open-air room. Only one wall stands here, a divider to some unseen area; covered in brilliant emerald vines, splitting and taking over through cracks and niches. A single dark green vine appears sturdy enough to climb. A handmade bronze sun rests upon the wall, attached at the rough hammered points, only barely visible through the vines. Furniture built of bronze and brass center around a small pond within the center of the room. Hardly deep, a few metallic-hued fish can be seen through the emerald greenish mossy waters. When night turns to day, the bronze sun glows momentarily as a pale blue mist comes from within it, creating a magickal faux sky overhead resembling that of noon time; slowly it fades away as the day truly changes and the stars outside fade from few.  A deep crack in the wall and a smooth ebony archway are here.

[Bond Garden.]

Mysterious mists form the barrier around this strange garden. Nothing can be seen of the route you took to get here. Giant sized flowers bloom all around you, each one a different color and shade. A lush carpet of jewel green grass cushions your feet. The call of exotic birds echo through the air. Breaking through the path of flowers you come upon a small clump of peach trees. Luscious fruits hang from their drooping branches. Some have already been plucked and placed in a large straw basket. At the center of the stand of trees is spread a large quilted blanket. Upon closer examination of the quilt you notice each square shows a different stage of being in the life of a dragon. Quiet descends around you, filling the area with a sense of peace.  A long vine, a closed deep ribboned picnic basket, and a large multicolored quilted blanket are here.

[Day.]

Bright light fills this room at all times of day, reminding of pure, natural sunlight.  The rays of illumination have a brassy tint to them, creating a warm hued glow upon the simple furniture of this open-air room. Only one wall stands here, a divider to some unseen area; covered in brilliant emerald vines, splitting and taking over through cracks and niches. A single dark green vine appears sturdy enough to climb. A handmade bronze sun rests upon the wall, attached at the rough hammered points, only barely visible through the vines. Furniture built of bronze and brass center around a small pond within the center of the room. Hardly deep, a few metallic-hued fish can be seen through the emerald greenish mossy waters. When night turns to day, the bronze sun glows momentarily as a pale blue mist comes from within it, creating a magickal faux sky overhead resembling that of noon time; slowly it fades away as the day truly changes and the stars outside fade from few.  A deep crack in the wall and a smooth ebony archway are here.

[Night.]

Upon entering this pitch black painted circular room it is difficult to find your bearings at first. Much darker in hue than the rest of the areas, the decor has been styled to represent a midnight sky.  An ebony archway barely visible rests on the far wall, magick surrounding it, preventing visibility into the area on the other side. Astonishing platinum stars inlaid into the ceiling flicker in the low pillar candle light.  Magickal platinum flamed candles made of deep black beeswax rest upon small round ebony tables.  Light fluffy pillows shaped to resemble clouds are stacked in three corners, dark blue and indigo in shade.  A few warm fleece blankets are stacked upon a black marble shelf carved into the wall, allowing visitors to keep warm even on the coldest of nights.  A winding wrought iron railed staircase, a closed smooth black marble box dotted with stars, and a smooth ebony archway are here.

[Entryway.]

A smooth gray marble floor flecked with white spreads out beneath you. A constant, calming sound of trickling water can be heard from a small matching marble fountain in the center. The fresh water trickles down from the three-tiered fountain spreading over little black and white pebbles in the basin. Pillows of bright colors, large and small, line the corner of the room, providing an inviting place for conversations and relaxation. A winding staircase with a thick wrought iron railing wraps its way upwards, only to grow hazy with wisps of mist as it reaches the ceiling. A few carved marble benches line the fountain for those that wish to sit next to it, the feet of the seating resembling that of a clawed Dragon. Affixed to one of the walls is a small plaque made of a blackened silvery-gray metal.  A blackened silver-trimmed plaque, a tall flowing marble fountain, and a mist covered cobblestone pathway are here.

[Pathway Garden.]

Cheerful laughter can be heard echoing through this open air garden as wisps of bright colors flash past. Secians run and play a game of mid-flight tag, merrily flying past one another as their rainbow wings become a blur. Gray flecked white marble benches line a small, deep blue pool filled with cool, tranquil waters with the exception of a stray duck making a crash-landing. Various sorts of flowers from every imaginable part of Aradath sprout in full bloom in all areas, nearly overtaking the pathway. A red rosebush stands out in particular, well kept, the flowers bloom brilliantly opening to the sun. The scent of delicate floral mixed with fresh grass and tall, green leafed trees makes for an intoxicatingly fresh aroma.  A red rosebush and a mist covered cobblestone pathway are here.

[Mystical Garden.]

The garden is surrounded by a non-symmetrical stone wall done in earthen shades, yellow roses and wild vines clinging to its stony face. A small mosaic just barely peeking out from the mass of flowers and leaves can be viewed as the sun rises. In the midst of it all, a large willow tree spreads its massive branches over the area, colorful paper lanterns hanging within. A lush blanket of natural carpet, deep green clover spouting from the ground to form a soft pathway. The edge of the pond reaches to the edge of the path, the beginning of a breathtaking garden starting here. In the distance the calls of ducks and other wildlife can be heard. From one of the tallest tree branches, the echoing hum of busy bees sound from a golden beehive, the scent of honey filling the air with a delightful aroma.  Some earthen stone wall and an open vine entwined silver gate are here.

The scent of fresh, green trodden grass, and the gentle rustling of the golden leaves overhead delighted the senses. On the edge of the property, a waterfall trickles over an embankment of several large white stones into a light green pool below. The glistening water travels down a slow moving stream caring fallen leaves and grass.  A glistening stream and an open vine entwined silver gate are here.

Several majestic willow trees, with their long drooping branches, stand at the top of a gently sloping hill. A slight wind blows among the trees and grass in this flowery meadow while a trickling stream flows among the boulders at the bottom of a small hill. Home to many small animals, patches of tall grass and several bushes grow around the stream.  A large willow tree is here.

Several well placed street lanterns line the well kept cobblestone path. A towering oak tree sits off to the side of the path. Its leaves blow and twist displaying its various mint green colors. Nestled in its branches several blue birds call back and forth to one another in song. Floating grey clouds pass by overhead.

A low hedge grows between the Spurian Wall and the street. Flowers bloom on the hedge, and cheer up what might be a dreary view. Two guards lean over the tall wall and call down greetings to those who pass. At any time of the day, one may pass a Fir Elf on the way to market, or a Hithual stumbling home to sleep.

A shadowy black twisted free form metal sculpture stands on a small patch of grass at the beginning of Shoteron Way. Its unique design catches the light of both the sun and the moon. Below the memorial are several small items that have been left in passing. The well-manicured cobblestone path shows signs that it is well traveled, with enough room for even the largest cart or Leuian family.  A street lantern is here.

[Law Road & Shoteron Way.]

Law Road from the south and Shoteron Way from the east join before turning toward Town Square to the northwest. If one stays at this location long enough, they see the irony of these two roads joining. Most who are escorted south along Law Road are the criminals and ne'er-do-wells of the Spur, while those travel along Shoteron Way are the upper class residents whom live further east. Two office building, the City Planners Office and the Archmage's office stand on opposite sides of the road, each one neatly kept and freshly painted.  A street lantern and a closed morbius door are here.

A large wagon sits on the side of the street, its load having shifted and then toppled over. A Usil driver yells at his two Oog-ra helpers, explaining to them that the armoire should be sitting upright and not on its side. They scratch themselves in confusion, and you can hear them muttering something about leaving it on its side, so it does not fall again. There will be a resident who is unhappy with their purchase this evening.  A street lantern is here.

A neatly trimmed hedge with a small strip of grass fronts the road that travels between the Spurian Housing District and the center of town. A well dressed Frontacian woman hurries along the path as two immaculately dressed Guards lead a criminal towards the jail. She sniffs in a haughty manner, and tips her hat down so she does not have to view the filth of the city.  A street lantern is here.

The elegant Hotel Royale towers above the street, its emerald door sparkling in the light. The patrons that stroll in and out are catered to, doors opened and closed for them, and baggage and packages carried by harried servants. The large Bank of Spur sits on the east side of the square. Its location close to the Royale is not a coincidence. A gold-trimmed door is proof of the success of this branch of the Spurian bank and those who run it.  An elegant gold-trimmed walnut door, open emerald steel door, and a street lantern are here.

Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.   A flowing white marble fountain, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a cracked marble statue of a Human, a carved marble statue of a Dragon, a rosewood sign, some flaming ruby ashes, and a deep fluffy snow drift are here.

The outward appearance of the people here seems a bit classier. Rich clothing and large coin purses are prevalent amongst the travelers. In fact, many of the folk heading into Town Square from the south are accompanied by large bodyguards to assure their safety. The well maintained road is lined with small brass lanterns, each swinging off an individual pole. No expense has been spared to keep those who travel this road safe from the hoodlums that relish the darkness.  A street lantern is here.

[Town Square Center.]

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.   A flowing white marble fountain, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a cracked marble statue of a Human, a carved marble statue of a Dragon, a rosewood sign, some flaming ruby ashes, and a deep fluffy snow drift are here.

This area is illuminated.
You see the 1st city guard mage and the 1st raven (wearing a small gold collar).

[Town Square.]

The elegant Hotel Royale towers above the street, its emerald door sparkling in the light. The patrons that stroll in and out are catered to, doors opened and closed for them, and baggage and packages carried by harried servants. The large Bank of Spur sits on the east side of the square. Its location close to the Royale is not a coincidence. A gold-trimmed door is proof of the success of this branch of the Spurian bank and those who run it.  An elegant gold-trimmed walnut door, open emerald steel door, and a street lantern are here.

[Right Street.]

The road between the center of town and the housing district is well kept and maintained. Ruts are immediately repaired and small bushes and flowers line the way. The class of people that travel this way are better dressed and obviously of a higher class. Occasionally guards can be seen taking criminals towards the jail in an efficient and orderly manner.  A street lantern and a pair of closed wide mahogany doors are here.

A polished wooden bench sits in front of a neatly trimmed hedge. It is the perfect spot for those who wish to rest and allow their pets or children to play along the grass fronting the roadway. A small stone well complete with a dipper stands ready to slake the thirst of those who travel this way or who need a breather.  A small stone well and a street lantern are here.

A neatly trimmed hedge with a small strip of grass fronts the road that travels between the Spurian Housing District and the center of town. A well dressed Frontacian woman hurries along the path as two immaculately dressed Guards lead a criminal towards the jail. She sniffs in a haughty manner, and tips her hat down so she does not have to view the filth of the city.  A street lantern is here.

A large wagon sits on the side of the street, its load having shifted and then toppled over. A Usil driver yells at his two Oog-ra helpers, explaining to them that the armoire should be sitting upright and not on its side. They scratch themselves in confusion, and you can hear them muttering something about leaving it on its side, so it does not fall again. There will be a resident who is unhappy with their purchase this evening.  A street lantern is here.

Right Street ends at a gateway leading to the Housing and Administration District. Those living in this portion of town travel comfortably either by conveyance or by foot. Beautiful flowers grow on both sides of the well tended, freshly painted gate. In front, standing crisply at attention, a Guard tips his hat in greeting to all those who pass.  An open iron gate and a street lantern are here.

You are just inside the gateway between the Justice District and the Town Square. Most of those heading into the Justice District have a grim look about them. Then again, it could just be the chains. A small sign stands off to the side.  An open iron gate, a street lantern, and a wooden sign are here.

[Law Road & Shoteron Way.]

Law Road from the south and Shoteron Way from the east join before turning toward Town Square to the northwest. If one stays at this location long enough, they see the irony of these two roads joining. Most who are escorted south along Law Road are the criminals and ne'er-do-wells of the Spur, while those travel along Shoteron Way are the upper class residents whom live further east. Two office building, the City Planners Office and the Archmage's office stand on opposite sides of the road, each one neatly kept and freshly painted.  A street lantern and a closed morbius door are here.

A shadowy black twisted free form metal sculpture stands on a small patch of grass at the beginning of Shoteron Way. Its unique design catches the light of both the sun and the moon. Below the memorial are several small items that have been left in passing. The well-manicured cobblestone path shows signs that it is well traveled, with enough room for even the largest cart or Leuian family.  A street lantern is here.

A low hedge grows between the Spurian Wall and the street. Flowers bloom on the hedge, and cheer up what might be a dreary view. Two guards lean over the tall wall and call down greetings to those who pass. At any time of the day, one may pass a Fir Elf on the way to market, or a Hithual stumbling home to sleep.  A street lantern and an open large wrought iron gate are here.

[Cobblestone Lane.]

Several well placed street lanterns line the well kept cobblestone path. A towering oak tree sits off to the side of the path. Its leaves blow and twist displaying its various mint green colors. Nestled in its branches several blue birds call back and forth to one another in song. Floating grey clouds pass by overhead.  An open large wrought iron gate, a colorful cobblestone path, and a glowing tall wrought iron street lantern are here.

Adjacent to the street lanterns, two wooden benches lay next to the cobblestone path. A fluttering yellow and orange butterfly flits back and forth amongst large lilac trees displaying their purple hues. A gentle breeze picks up the sweet scent of the purple flowers and carries it across the lane.  A colorful cobblestone path, a glowing tall wrought iron street lantern, a rosewood bench, and a flowering lilac tree are here.

Several majestic willow trees, with their long drooping branches, stand at the top of a gently sloping hill. A slight wind blows among the trees and grass in this flowery meadow while a trickling stream flows among the boulders at the bottom of a small hill. Home to many small animals, patches of tall grass and several bushes grow around the stream.  A large willow tree is here.

[Willow Hill.]

The scent of fresh, green trodden grass, and the gentle rustling of the golden leaves overhead delighted the senses. On the edge of the property, a waterfall trickles over an embankment of several large white stones into a light green pool below. The glistening water travels down a slow moving stream caring fallen leaves and grass.  A glistening stream is here.

[Mystical Garden.]

The garden is surrounded by a non-symmetrical stone wall done in earthen shades, yellow roses and wild vines clinging to its stony face. A small mosaic just barely peeking out from the mass of flowers and leaves can be viewed as the sun rises. In the midst of it all, a large willow tree spreads its massive branches over the area, colorful paper lanterns hanging within. A lush blanket of natural carpet, deep green clover spouting from the ground to form a soft pathway. The edge of the pond reaches to the edge of the path, the beginning of a breathtaking garden starting here. In the distance the calls of ducks and other wildlife can be heard. From one of the tallest tree branches, the echoing hum of busy bees sound from a golden beehive, the scent of honey filling the air with a delightful aroma.  Some earthen stone wall and an open vine entwined silver gate are here.

Cheerful laughter can be heard echoing through this open air garden as wisps of bright colors flash past. Secians run and play a game of mid-flight tag, merrily flying past one another as their rainbow wings become a blur. Gray flecked white marble benches line a small, deep blue pool filled with cool, tranquil waters with the exception of a stray duck making a crash-landing. Various sorts of flowers from every imaginable part of Aradath sprout in full bloom in all areas, nearly overtaking the pathway. A red rosebush stands out in particular, well kept, the flowers bloom brilliantly opening to the sun. The scent of delicate floral mixed with fresh grass and tall, green leafed trees makes for an intoxicatingly fresh aroma.  A red rosebush is here.

A smooth gray marble floor flecked with white spreads out beneath you. A constant, calming sound of trickling water can be heard from a small matching marble fountain in the center. The fresh water trickles down from the three-tiered fountain spreading over little black and white pebbles in the basin. Pillows of bright colors, large and small, line the corner of the room, providing an inviting place for conversations and relaxation. A winding staircase with a thick wrought iron railing wraps its way upwards, only to grow hazy with wisps of mist as it reaches the ceiling. A few carved marble benches line the fountain for those that wish to sit next to it, the feet of the seating resembling that of a clawed Dragon. Affixed to one of the walls is a small plaque made of a blackened silvery-gray metal.

Worn stones form the walls and floor of this room; veined in ruby, the stones feel warm on the soles of your feet, glowing with their radiating heat. The air shimmers with the warmth emanating from the center of the area. A huge gold lined pit sits directly in the middle, magical red and amber flames dance within it. Roughly carved wooden logs surround the blaze, allowing one to bask in the warmth of the flames. Shadows dance along the walls, forming the perfect backdrop of mystery. Charred-ended sticks are scattered about, some with the blackened remains of marshmallows and other roasted foods.  Some glowing mystical red swirled amber flames and a golden fire pit are here.

Only two walls remain of this once large room. A few stray blades of grass protrude through the stone floor, sprouting between the cracks. You can still make out what was once a glorious mosaic, depicting a fluffy white cloud puffing a breath of swirled white and sapphire wind. A warm breeze flows through the area, and whispers through the four supportive blue sapphire pillars holding aloft a highly polished dome roof. A few cracks in the silver dome allow rays of warm sunlight to enter, creating chaotic patterns on the floor as the sun moves throughout the day. Suddenly a myriad of bubbles surround you, dancing through the air entering from cracks within the wall. The bubbles pop as they touch any furniture or person and vanish from sight. Soft feather stuffed white and blue silk pillows lay in groups around the room, surprisingly untouched from the elements and popping bubbles.  A pile of blue and white feathered pillows is here.

A few fan-tailed fish swim through the underground pool and fade away from sight to some unknown area. A gentle breeze blows through the room at sporadic times, refreshing and soothing. Stray patches of white sand litter the floor, leading to their dune piles residing in the corners, creating a comfortable place to sit or build a castle.

A smooth gray marble floor flecked with white spreads out beneath you. A constant, calming sound of trickling water can be heard from a small matching marble fountain in the center. The fresh water trickles down from the three-tiered fountain spreading over little black and white pebbles in the basin. Pillows of bright colors, large and small, line the corner of the room, providing an inviting place for conversations and relaxation. A winding staircase with a thick wrought iron railing wraps its way upwards, only to grow hazy with wisps of mist as it reaches the ceiling. A few carved marble benches line the fountain for those that wish to sit next to it, the feet of the seating resembling that of a clawed Dragon. Affixed to one of the walls is a small plaque made of a blackened silvery-gray metal.  A blackened silver-trimmed plaque, a tall flowing marble fountain, and a mist covered cobblestone pathway are here.

Overhead, the canopy of deep green leaves allows for only a little bit of sun to shine through, dappling the area in patches light. The dark brown trees seem ancient and impossibly huge. Vines climb across their branches, connecting each to the next. Lush vegetation grows around their bases; broad leafed ferns, and tropical flowers. A few rare copper tinted flowers sprout near the tallest of the dark trees. Bright jewel colored hummingbirds dart around cheerfully, not seeming to mind any noise or visitors. The roots of the largest tree in the center of the grove form a small depression, filled with the blue green waters accumulated during rainfall. Small stone benches rest in the nooks of the roots around the pool. Copper basins next to them are filled with refreshments.  A majestic willow tree and an ancient tarnished copper basin are here.

Upon entering this pitch black painted circular room it is difficult to find your bearings at first. Much darker in hue than the rest of the areas, the decor has been styled to represent a midnight sky.  An ebony archway barely visible rests on the far wall, magick surrounding it, preventing visibility into the area on the other side. Astonishing platinum stars inlaid into the ceiling flicker in the low pillar candle light.  Magickal platinum flamed candles made of deep black beeswax rest upon small round ebony tables.  Light fluffy pillows shaped to resemble clouds are stacked in three corners, dark blue and indigo in shade.  A few warm fleece blankets are stacked upon a black marble shelf carved into the wall, allowing visitors to keep warm even on the coldest of nights.

[Day.]

Bright light fills this room at all times of day, reminding of pure, natural sunlight.  The rays of illumination have a brassy tint to them, creating a warm hued glow upon the simple furniture of this open-air room. Only one wall stands here, a divider to some unseen area; covered in brilliant emerald vines, splitting and taking over through cracks and niches. A single dark green vine appears sturdy enough to climb. A handmade bronze sun rests upon the wall, attached at the rough hammered points, only barely visible through the vines. Furniture built of bronze and brass center around a small pond within the center of the room. Hardly deep, a few metallic-hued fish can be seen through the emerald greenish mossy waters. When night turns to day, the bronze sun glows momentarily as a pale blue mist comes from within it, creating a magickal faux sky overhead resembling that of noon time; slowly it fades away as the day truly changes and the stars outside fade from few.  A deep crack in the wall and a smooth ebony archway are here.

Mysterious mists form the barrier around this strange garden. Nothing can be seen of the route you took to get here. Giant sized flowers bloom all around you, each one a different color and shade. A lush carpet of jewel green grass cushions your feet. The call of exotic birds echo through the air. Breaking through the path of flowers you come upon a small clump of peach trees. Luscious fruits hang from their drooping branches. Some have already been plucked and placed in a large straw basket. At the center of the stand of trees is spread a large quilted blanket. Upon closer examination of the quilt you notice each square shows a different stage of being in the life of a dragon. Quiet descends around you, filling the area with a sense of peace.  A long vine, a closed deep ribboned picnic basket, and a large multicolored quilted blanket are here.

Four sturdy walls and a roof of woven branches enclose this small tavern. From the forest floor, winding their way around the trunk of the Mother Tree, a set of intricately railed steps serve as the entrance and exit of the town of Treehaven. Strangers arriving at the top of the steps find themselves under the watchful eye of patrons seated at tables positioned about the light, airy room. A set of oak steps lead up to the new Council chambers.

An abundant gallery of paintings depicting sacrifices and hold offerings to their god suspend from crooked iron nails. Resting beside each painting, cold black iron braziers appear to hold burned blood and bone. A few charred, blackened pieces can be found in them. Several iron chains hang along the walls of the sacrificial chamber. Along the floor, intricately placed colored slate tiles are coated in dust covered dried blood.

Gray flecked white marble benches line a small, deep blue pool filled with cool, tranquil waters with the exception of a stray duck making a crash-landing. Various sorts of flowers from every imaginable part of Aradath sprout in full bloom in all areas, nearly overtaking the pathway. A red rosebush stands out in particular, well kept, the flowers bloom brilliantly opening to the sun.

A small mosaic just barely peeking out from the mass of flowers and leaves can be viewed as the sun rises. In the midst of it all, a large willow tree spreads its massive branches over the area, colorful paper lanterns hanging within. A lush blanket of natural carpet, deep green clover spouting from the ground to form a soft pathway. The edge of the pond reaches to the edge of the path, the beginning of a breathtaking garden starting here. In the distance the calls of ducks and other wildlife can be heard. From one of the tallest tree branches, the echoing hum of busy bees sound from a golden beehive, the scent of honey filling the air with a delightful aroma.  Some earthen stone wall and an open vine entwined silver gate are here.

[Cobblestone Lane.]

Several well placed street lanterns line the well kept cobblestone path. A towering oak tree sits off to the side of the path. Its leaves blow and twist displaying its various mint green colors. Nestled in its branches several blue birds call back and forth to one another in song. Floating grey clouds pass by overhead.  An open large wrought iron gate, a colorful cobblestone path, and a glowing tall wrought iron street lantern are here.

A low hedge grows between the Spurian Wall and the street. Flowers bloom on the hedge, and cheer up what might be a dreary view. Two guards lean over the tall wall and call down greetings to those who pass. At any time of the day, one may pass a Fir Elf on the way to market, or a Hithual stumbling home to sleep.

Law Road from the south and Shoteron Way from the east join before turning toward Town Square to the northwest. If one stays at this location long enough, they see the irony of these two roads joining. Most who are escorted south along Law Road are the criminals and ne'er-do-wells of the Spur, while those travel along Shoteron Way are the upper class residents whom live further east.

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.   A flowing white marble fountain, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a cracked marble statue of a Human, a carved marble statue of a Dragon, a rosewood sign, some flaming ruby ashes, and a deep fluffy snow drift are here.

In front of each home is a beautiful garden, created to reflect the personality of those who live within. A well manicured courtyard sits in front of the homes dotted with smaller pines and benches.

Set among the large pine trees are four small white bungalows. Each with a uniquely colored door. They are set in an "L" shape, two of them north of the road and two of them east, a mirror reflection of the bungalows to the south. In front of each home is a beautiful garden, created to reflect the personality of those who live within. A well manicured courtyard sits in front of the homes dotted with smaller pines and benches. Small rabbits hop along unmolested nibbling upon the lush grass.  A closed blue pine door, a closed tan pine door, a closed red pine door, and a closed white pine door are here.

The broad expanse of lawn is dotted with pine cones and various animals. The wind blowing through the tall pine trees whistles as the mighty branches sway and dance far above. The white stone road splits as it heads towards the east, leading towards several sets of low slung bungalows. On the north side of the road a small cottage sits nestled among the trees. On the south side of the road a handsome two-story building a sign hanging on the front is carved with the single word, "Office."  A closed intricate steelwood door and a closed solid bluesteel door are here.

Two tall pines stand sentinel on either side of the small white stone lane. A neatly manicured lawn rides up against a smooth stone wall on both the southern and northern property line. The white road is made up of identically sized white stones that are so perfectly fitted together it is hard to tell that the road is not one long single piece. A single wooden bench sits under one of the larger trees, a nice place to rest and reflect.  An open large pine gate is here.

Several majestic willow trees, with their long drooping branches, stand at the top of a gently sloping hill. A slight wind blows among the trees and grass in this flowery meadow while a trickling stream flows among the boulders at the bottom of a small hill. Home to many small animals, patches of tall grass and several bushes grow around the stream.  A large willow tree is here.

The garden is surrounded by a non-symmetrical stone wall done in earthen shades, yellow roses and wild vines clinging to its stony face. A small mosaic just barely peeking out from the mass of flowers and leaves can be viewed as the sun rises. In the midst of it all, a large willow tree spreads its massive branches over the area, colorful paper lanterns hanging within. A lush blanket of natural carpet, deep green clover spouting from the ground to form a soft pathway. The edge of the pond reaches to the edge of the path, the beginning of a breathtaking garden starting here. In the distance the calls of ducks and other wildlife can be heard. From one of the tallest tree branches, the echoing hum of busy bees sound from a golden beehive, the scent of honey filling the air with a delightful aroma.  Some earthen stone wall and an open vine entwined silver gate are here.

Cheerful laughter can be heard echoing through this open air garden as wisps of bright colors flash past. Secians run and play a game of mid-flight tag, merrily flying past one another as their rainbow wings become a blur. Gray flecked white marble benches line a small, deep blue pool filled with cool, tranquil waters with the exception of a stray duck making a crash-landing. Various sorts of flowers from every imaginable part of Aradath sprout in full bloom in all areas, nearly overtaking the pathway. A red rosebush stands out in particular, well kept, the flowers bloom brilliantly opening to the sun. The scent of delicate floral mixed with fresh grass and tall, green leafed trees makes for an intoxicatingly fresh aroma.  A red rosebush is here.

On her face is a tattoo of a tiny dazzling misty blue raindrop under her right eye.

On her belly is a tattoo of a silver fox curled on a shining rainbow crescent moon around her navel.

She appears to be in perfect health.
There is a shining gold emblem affixed to her clothing.

You follow Midnight through a mist covered cobblestone pathway...

[Entryway.]

A smooth gray marble floor flecked with white spreads out beneath you. A constant, calming sound of trickling water can be heard from a small matching marble fountain in the center. The fresh water trickles down from the three-tiered fountain spreading over little black and white pebbles in the basin. Pillows of bright colors, large and small, line the corner of the room, providing an inviting place for conversations and relaxation. A winding staircase with a thick wrought iron railing wraps its way upwards, only to grow hazy with wisps of mist as it reaches the ceiling. A few carved marble benches line the fountain for those that wish to sit next to it, the feet of the seating resembling that of a clawed Dragon. Affixed to one of the walls is a small plaque made of a blackened silvery-gray metal.  A blackened silver-trimmed plaque, a tall flowing marble fountain, and a mist covered cobblestone pathway are here.

This room is illuminated.
You see the 1st black and white spotted dalmation puppy (wearing a small gold collar).
In the room are Mahtina the Noble Secian, Miriel the Secian, Midnight the Noble Secian, Equality the Noble Secian, and Meliya the Noble Secian (holding a glowing swirling tornado of desert sand).

[Fire.]

Worn stones form the walls and floor of this room; veined in ruby, the stones feel warm on the soles of your feet, glowing with their radiating heat. The air shimmers with the warmth emanating from the center of the area. A huge gold lined pit sits directly in the middle, magical red and amber flames dance within it. Roughly carved wooden logs surround the blaze, allowing one to bask in the warmth of the flames. Shadows dance along the walls, forming the perfect backdrop of mystery. Charred-ended sticks are scattered about, some with the blackened remains of marshmallows and other roasted foods.  Some glowing mystical red swirled amber flames and a golden fire pit are here.

[Pathway Garden.]

Cheerful laughter can be heard echoing through this open air garden as wisps of bright colors flash past. Secians run and play a game of mid-flight tag, merrily flying past one another as their rainbow wings become a blur. Gray flecked white marble benches line a small, deep blue pool filled with cool, tranquil waters with the exception of a stray duck making a crash-landing. Various sorts of flowers from every imaginable part of Aradath sprout in full bloom in all areas, nearly overtaking the pathway. A red rosebush stands out in particular, well kept, the flowers bloom brilliantly opening to the sun. The scent of delicate floral mixed with fresh grass and tall, green leafed trees makes for an intoxicatingly fresh aroma.  A red rosebush and a mist covered cobblestone pathway are here.

The garden is surrounded by a non-symmetrical stone wall done in earthen shades, yellow roses and wild vines clinging to its stony face. A small mosaic just barely peeking out from the mass of flowers and leaves can be viewed as the sun rises. In the midst of it all, a large willow tree spreads its massive branches over the area, colorful paper lanterns hanging within. A lush blanket of natural carpet, deep green clover spouting from the ground to form a soft pathway. The edge of the pond reaches to the edge of the path, the beginning of a breathtaking garden starting here. In the distance the calls of ducks and other wildlife can be heard. From one of the tallest tree branches, the echoing hum of busy bees sound from a golden beehive, the scent of honey filling the air with a delightful aroma.  Some earthen stone wall and an open vine entwined silver gate are here.

Law Road from the south and Shoteron Way from the east join before turning toward Town Square to the northwest. If one stays at this location long enough, they see the irony of these two roads joining. Most who are escorted south along Law Road are the criminals and ne'er-do-wells of the Spur, while those travel along Shoteron Way are the upper class residents whom live further east. Two office building, the City Planners Office and the Archmage's office stand on opposite sides of the road, each one neatly kept and freshly painted.

Beautiful flowers grow on both sides of the well tended, freshly painted gate. In front, standing crisply at attention, a Guard tips his hat in greeting to all those who pass.  An open iron gate and a street lantern are here.

A large wagon sits on the side of the street, its load having shifted and then toppled over. A Usil driver yells at his two Oog-ra helpers, explaining to them that the armoire should be sitting upright and not on its side. They scratch themselves in confusion, and you can hear them muttering something about leaving it on its side, so it does not fall again. There will be a resident who is unhappy with their purchase this evening.  A street lantern is here.

A neatly trimmed hedge with a small strip of grass fronts the road that travels between the Spurian Housing District and the center of town. A well dressed Frontacian woman hurries along the path as two immaculately dressed Guards lead a criminal towards the jail. She sniffs in a haughty manner, and tips her hat down so she does not have to view the filth of the city.  A street lantern is here.

A polished wooden bench sits in front of a neatly trimmed hedge. It is the perfect spot for those who wish to rest and allow their pets or children to play along the grass fronting the roadway.

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.

[Right Street.]

A polished wooden bench sits in front of a neatly trimmed hedge. It is the perfect spot for those who wish to rest and allow their pets or children to play along the grass fronting the roadway. A small stone well complete with a dipper stands ready to slake the thirst of those who travel this way or who need a breather.  A small stone well and a street lantern are here.

[Right Street.]

A neatly trimmed hedge with a small strip of grass fronts the road that travels between the Spurian Housing District and the center of town. A well dressed Frontacian woman hurries along the path as two immaculately dressed Guards lead a criminal towards the jail. She sniffs in a haughty manner, and tips her hat down so she does not have to view the filth of the city.  A street lantern is here.

You follow Midnight southeast...

[Right Street.]

A large wagon sits on the side of the street, its load having shifted and then toppled over. A Usil driver yells at his two Oog-ra helpers, explaining to them that the armoire should be sitting upright and not on its side. They scratch themselves in confusion, and you can hear them muttering something about leaving it on its side, so it does not fall again. There will be a resident who is unhappy with their purchase this evening.  A street lantern is here.

[Right Street.]

Right Street ends at a gateway leading to the Housing and Administration District. Those living in this portion of town travel comfortably either by conveyance or by foot. Beautiful flowers grow on both sides of the well tended, freshly painted gate. In front, standing crisply at attention, a Guard tips his hat in greeting to all those who pass.  An open iron gate and a street lantern are here.

You follow Midnight through an open iron gate...

[Gateway.]

You are just inside the gateway between the Justice District and the Town Square. Most of those heading into the Justice District have a grim look about them. Then again, it could just be the chains. A small sign stands off to the side.  An open iron gate, a street lantern, and a wooden sign are here.

Mahtina reaches out and tenderly joins hands with Darrow.

You follow Midnight southeast...

[Law Road & Shoteron Way.]

Law Road from the south and Shoteron Way from the east join before turning toward Town Square to the northwest. If one stays at this location long enough, they see the irony of these two roads joining. Most who are escorted south along Law Road are the criminals and ne'er-do-wells of the Spur, while those travel along Shoteron Way are the upper class residents whom live further east. Two office building, the City Planners Office and the Archmage's office stand on opposite sides of the road, each one neatly kept and freshly painted.  A street lantern and a closed morbius door are here.

[Shoteron Way.]

A shadowy black twisted free form metal sculpture stands on a small patch of grass at the beginning of Shoteron Way. Its unique design catches the light of both the sun and the moon. Below the memorial are several small items that have been left in passing. The well-manicured cobblestone path shows signs that it is well traveled, with enough room for even the largest cart or Leuian family.  A street lantern is here.

[Shoteron Way.]

A low hedge grows between the Spurian Wall and the street. Flowers bloom on the hedge, and cheer up what might be a dreary view. Two guards lean over the tall wall and call down greetings to those who pass. At any time of the day, one may pass a Fir Elf on the way to market, or a Hithual stumbling home to sleep.  A street lantern and an open large wrought iron gate are here.

[Cobblestone Lane.]

Several well placed street lanterns line the well kept cobblestone path. A towering oak tree sits off to the side of the path. Its leaves blow and twist displaying its various mint green colors. Nestled in its branches several blue birds call back and forth to one another in song. Floating grey clouds pass by overhead.  An open large wrought iron gate, a colorful cobblestone path, and a glowing tall wrought iron street lantern are here.

Darrow smiles warmly at Mahtina.

You follow Midnight south...

[Cobblestone Lane.]

Adjacent to the street lanterns, two wooden benches lay next to the cobblestone path. A fluttering yellow and orange butterfly flits back and forth amongst large lilac trees displaying their purple hues. A gentle breeze picks up the sweet scent of the purple flowers and carries it across the lane.  A colorful cobblestone path, a glowing tall wrought iron street lantern, a rosewood bench, and a flowering lilac tree are here.

[Raine Estates.]

Several majestic willow trees, with their long drooping branches, stand at the top of a gently sloping hill. A slight wind blows among the trees and grass in this flowery meadow while a trickling stream flows among the boulders at the bottom of a small hill. Home to many small animals, patches of tall grass and several bushes grow around the stream.  A large willow tree is here.

The scent of fresh, green trodden grass, and the gentle rustling of the golden leaves overhead delighted the senses. On the edge of the property, a waterfall trickles over an embankment of several large white stones into a light green pool below. The glistening water travels down a slow moving stream caring fallen leaves and grass.  A glistening stream is here.

[Mystical Garden.]

The garden is surrounded by a non-symmetrical stone wall done in earthen shades, yellow roses and wild vines clinging to its stony face. A small mosaic just barely peeking out from the mass of flowers and leaves can be viewed as the sun rises. In the midst of it all, a large willow tree spreads its massive branches over the area, colorful paper lanterns hanging within. A lush blanket of natural carpet, deep green clover spouting from the ground to form a soft pathway. The edge of the pond reaches to the edge of the path, the beginning of a breathtaking garden starting here. In the distance the calls of ducks and other wildlife can be heard. From one of the tallest tree branches, the echoing hum of busy bees sound from a golden beehive, the scent of honey filling the air with a delightful aroma.  Some earthen stone wall and an open vine entwined silver gate are here.

[Pathway Garden.]

Cheerful laughter can be heard echoing through this open air garden as wisps of bright colors flash past. Secians run and play a game of mid-flight tag, merrily flying past one another as their rainbow wings become a blur. Gray flecked white marble benches line a small, deep blue pool filled with cool, tranquil waters with the exception of a stray duck making a crash-landing. Various sorts of flowers from every imaginable part of Aradath sprout in full bloom in all areas, nearly overtaking the pathway. A red rosebush stands out in particular, well kept, the flowers bloom brilliantly opening to the sun. The scent of delicate floral mixed with fresh grass and tall, green leafed trees makes for an intoxicatingly fresh aroma.  A red rosebush is here.

[Entryway.]

A smooth gray marble floor flecked with white spreads out beneath you. A constant, calming sound of trickling water can be heard from a small matching marble fountain in the center. The fresh water trickles down from the three-tiered fountain spreading over little black and white pebbles in the basin. Pillows of bright colors, large and small, line the corner of the room, providing an inviting place for conversations and relaxation. A winding staircase with a thick wrought iron railing wraps its way upwards, only to grow hazy with wisps of mist as it reaches the ceiling. A few carved marble benches line the fountain for those that wish to sit next to it, the feet of the seating resembling that of a clawed Dragon. Affixed to one of the walls is a small plaque made of a blackened silvery-gray metal.

Worn stones form the walls and floor of this room; veined in ruby, the stones feel warm on the soles of your feet, glowing with their radiating heat. The air shimmers with the warmth emanating from the center of the area. A huge gold lined pit sits directly in the middle, magical red and amber flames dance within it. Roughly carved wooden logs surround the blaze, allowing one to bask in the warmth of the flames. Shadows dance along the walls, forming the perfect backdrop of mystery. Charred-ended sticks are scattered about, some with the blackened remains of marshmallows and other roasted foods.  Some glowing mystical red swirled amber flames and a golden fire pit are here.

[Air.]

Only two walls remain of this once large room. A few stray blades of grass protrude through the stone floor, sprouting between the cracks. You can still make out what was once a glorious mosaic, depicting a fluffy white cloud puffing a breath of swirled white and sapphire wind. A warm breeze flows through the area, and whispers through the four supportive blue sapphire pillars holding aloft a highly polished dome roof. A few cracks in the silver dome allow rays of warm sunlight to enter, creating chaotic patterns on the floor as the sun moves throughout the day. Suddenly a myriad of bubbles surround you, dancing through the air entering from cracks within the wall. The bubbles pop as they touch any furniture or person and vanish from sight. Soft feather stuffed white and blue silk pillows lay in groups around the room, surprisingly untouched from the elements and popping bubbles.  A pile of blue and white feathered pillows is here.

[Air.]

Only two walls remain of this once large room. A few stray blades of grass protrude through the stone floor, sprouting between the cracks. You can still make out what was once a glorious mosaic, depicting a fluffy white cloud puffing a breath of swirled white and sapphire wind. A warm breeze flows through the area, and whispers through the four supportive blue sapphire pillars holding aloft a highly polished dome roof. A few cracks in the silver dome allow rays of warm sunlight to enter, creating chaotic patterns on the floor as the sun moves throughout the day. Suddenly a myriad of bubbles surround you, dancing through the air entering from cracks within the wall. The bubbles pop as they touch any furniture or person and vanish from sight. Soft feather stuffed white and blue silk pillows lay in groups around the room, surprisingly untouched from the elements and popping bubbles.  A pile of blue and white feathered pillows is here.

This room is illuminated.
You see the 1st black and white spotted dalmation puppy (wearing a small gold collar) and the 1st flying squirrel (wearing a small gold collar).

[Entryway.]

A smooth gray marble floor flecked with white spreads out beneath you. A constant, calming sound of trickling water can be heard from a small matching marble fountain in the center. The fresh water trickles down from the three-tiered fountain spreading over little black and white pebbles in the basin. Pillows of bright colors, large and small, line the corner of the room, providing an inviting place for conversations and relaxation. A winding staircase with a thick wrought iron railing wraps its way upwards, only to grow hazy with wisps of mist as it reaches the ceiling. A few carved marble benches line the fountain for those that wish to sit next to it, the feet of the seating resembling that of a clawed Dragon. Affixed to one of the walls is a small plaque made of a blackened silvery-gray metal.  A blackened silver-trimmed plaque, a tall flowing marble fountain, and a mist covered cobblestone pathway are here.

[Water.]

A highly detailed mural in various shades of turquoise and amethyst depicts the rolling ocean. White sea foam spreads across the edges of the waves into the clear sky of the elaborate wall paintings. The floor is made of a thick glass, underneath a pool of water swirls creating the illusion of being out to sea. A few fan-tailed fish swim through the underground pool and fade away from sight to some unknown area. A gentle breeze blows through the room at sporadic times, refreshing and soothing. Stray patches of white sand litter the floor, leading to their dune piles residing in the corners, creating a comfortable place to sit or build a castle.  A closed amethyst swirled marble chest is here.

[Earth.]

Overhead, the canopy of deep green leaves allows for only a little bit of sun to shine through, dappling the area in patches light. The dark brown trees seem ancient and impossibly huge. Vines climb across their branches, connecting each to the next. Lush vegetation grows around their bases; broad leafed ferns, and tropical flowers. A few rare copper tinted flowers sprout near the tallest of the dark trees. Bright jewel colored hummingbirds dart around cheerfully, not seeming to mind any noise or visitors. The roots of the largest tree in the center of the grove form a small depression, filled with the blue green waters accumulated during rainfall. Small stone benches rest in the nooks of the roots around the pool. Copper basins next to them are filled with refreshments.  A majestic willow tree and an ancient tarnished copper basin are here.

Upon entering this pitch black painted circular room it is difficult to find your bearings at first. Much darker in hue than the rest of the areas, the decor has been styled to represent a midnight sky.  An ebony archway barely visible rests on the far wall, magick surrounding it, preventing visibility into the area on the other side. Astonishing platinum stars inlaid into the ceiling flicker in the low pillar candle light.  Magickal platinum flamed candles made of deep black beeswax rest upon small round ebony tables.  Light fluffy pillows shaped to resemble clouds are stacked in three corners, dark blue and indigo in shade.  A few warm fleece blankets are stacked upon a black marble shelf carved into the wall, allowing visitors to keep warm even on the coldest of nights.  A winding wrought iron railed staircase, a closed smooth black marble box dotted with stars, and a smooth ebony archway are here.

[Day.]

Bright light fills this room at all times of day, reminding of pure, natural sunlight.  The rays of illumination have a brassy tint to them, creating a warm hued glow upon the simple furniture of this open-air room. Only one wall stands here, a divider to some unseen area; covered in brilliant emerald vines, splitting and taking over through cracks and niches. A single dark green vine appears sturdy enough to climb. A handmade bronze sun rests upon the wall, attached at the rough hammered points, only barely visible through the vines. Furniture built of bronze and brass center around a small pond within the center of the room. Hardly deep, a few metallic-hued fish can be seen through the emerald greenish mossy waters. When night turns to day, the bronze sun glows momentarily as a pale blue mist comes from within it, creating a magickal faux sky overhead resembling that of noon time; slowly it fades away as the day truly changes and the stars outside fade from few.  A deep crack in the wall and a smooth ebony archway are here.

[Bond Garden.]

Mysterious mists form the barrier around this strange garden. Nothing can be seen of the route you took to get here. Giant sized flowers bloom all around you, each one a different color and shade. A lush carpet of jewel green grass cushions your feet. The call of exotic birds echo through the air. Breaking through the path of flowers you come upon a small clump of peach trees. Luscious fruits hang from their drooping branches. Some have already been plucked and placed in a large straw basket. At the center of the stand of trees is spread a large quilted blanket. Upon closer examination of the quilt you notice each square shows a different stage of being in the life of a dragon. Quiet descends around you, filling the area with a sense of peace.

Mysterious mists form the barrier around this strange garden. Nothing can be seen of the route you took to get here. Giant sized flowers bloom all around you, each one a different color and shade. A lush carpet of jewel green grass cushions your feet. The call of exotic birds echo through the air. Breaking through the path of flowers you come upon a small clump of peach trees. Luscious fruits hang from their drooping branches. Some have already been plucked and placed in a large straw basket. At the center of the stand of trees is spread a large quilted blanket. Upon closer examination of the quilt you notice each square shows a different stage of being in the life of a dragon. Quiet descends around you, filling the area with a sense of peace.  A long vine, a closed deep ribboned picnic basket, and a large multicolored quilted blanket are here.

                                    Visualization #1 is:
Mysterious mists form the barrier around this strange garden. Nothing can be seen of the route you took to get here. Giant sized flowers bloom all around you, each one a different color and shade. A lush carpet of jewel green grass cushions your feet. The call of exotic birds echo through the air. Breaking through the path of flowers you come upon a small clump of peach trees. Luscious fruits hang from their drooping branches. Some have already been plucked and placed in a large straw basket. At the center of the stand of trees is spread a large quilted blanket. Upon closer examination of the quilt you notice each square shows a different stage of being in the life of a dragon. Quiet descends around you, filling the area with a sense of peace.

                                    Visualization #2 is:
Four sturdy walls and a roof of woven branches enclose this small tavern. From the forest floor, winding their way around the trunk of the Mother Tree, a set of intricately railed steps serve as the entrance and exit of the town of Treehaven. Strangers arriving at the top of the steps find themselves under the watchful eye of patrons seated at tables positioned about the light, airy room. A set of oak steps lead up to the new Council chambers.

                                    Visualization #3 is:
An abundant gallery of paintings depicting sacrifices and hold offerings to their god suspend from crooked iron nails. Resting beside each painting, cold black iron braziers appear to hold burned blood and bone. A few charred, blackened pieces can be found in them. Several iron chains hang along the walls of the sacrificial chamber. Along the floor, intricately placed colored slate tiles are coated in dust covered dried blood. Centering the room is a raised platform accessible through a flight of stairs. Upon this raised formation rests an altar inlaid with rows and rows of teeth.

[Day.]

Bright light fills this room at all times of day, reminding of pure, natural sunlight.  The rays of illumination have a brassy tint to them, creating a warm hued glow upon the simple furniture of this open-air room. Only one wall stands here, a divider to some unseen area; covered in brilliant emerald vines, splitting and taking over through cracks and niches. A single dark green vine appears sturdy enough to climb. A handmade bronze sun rests upon the wall, attached at the rough hammered points, only barely visible through the vines. Furniture built of bronze and brass center around a small pond within the center of the room. Hardly deep, a few metallic-hued fish can be seen through the emerald greenish mossy waters. When night turns to day, the bronze sun glows momentarily as a pale blue mist comes from within it, creating a magickal faux sky overhead resembling that of noon time; slowly it fades away as the day truly changes and the stars outside fade from few.  A deep crack in the wall and a smooth ebony archway are here.

[Night.]

Upon entering this pitch black painted circular room it is difficult to find your bearings at first. Much darker in hue than the rest of the areas, the decor has been styled to represent a midnight sky.  An ebony archway barely visible rests on the far wall, magick surrounding it, preventing visibility into the area on the other side. Astonishing platinum stars inlaid into the ceiling flicker in the low pillar candle light.  Magickal platinum flamed candles made of deep black beeswax rest upon small round ebony tables.  Light fluffy pillows shaped to resemble clouds are stacked in three corners, dark blue and indigo in shade.  A few warm fleece blankets are stacked upon a black marble shelf carved into the wall, allowing visitors to keep warm even on the coldest of nights.  A winding wrought iron railed staircase, a closed smooth black marble box dotted with stars, and a smooth ebony archway are here.

A smooth gray marble floor flecked with white spreads out beneath you. A constant, calming sound of trickling water can be heard from a small matching marble fountain in the center. The fresh water trickles down from the three-tiered fountain spreading over little black and white pebbles in the basin. Pillows of bright colors, large and small, line the corner of the room, providing an inviting place for conversations and relaxation. A winding staircase with a thick wrought iron railing wraps its way upwards, only to grow hazy with wisps of mist as it reaches the ceiling. A few carved marble benches line the fountain for those that wish to sit next to it, the feet of the seating resembling that of a clawed Dragon. Affixed to one of the walls is a small plaque made of a blackened silvery-gray metal.  A blackened silver-trimmed plaque, a tall flowing marble fountain, and a mist covered cobblestone pathway are here.

[Pathway Garden.]

Cheerful laughter can be heard echoing through this open air garden as wisps of bright colors flash past. Secians run and play a game of mid-flight tag, merrily flying past one another as their rainbow wings become a blur. Gray flecked white marble benches line a small, deep blue pool filled with cool, tranquil waters with the exception of a stray duck making a crash-landing. Various sorts of flowers from every imaginable part of Aradath sprout in full bloom in all areas, nearly overtaking the pathway. A red rosebush stands out in particular, well kept, the flowers bloom brilliantly opening to the sun. The scent of delicate floral mixed with fresh grass and tall, green leafed trees makes for an intoxicatingly fresh aroma.  A red rosebush and a mist covered cobblestone pathway are here.

The garden is surrounded by a non-symmetrical stone wall done in earthen shades, yellow roses and wild vines clinging to its stony face. A small mosaic just barely peeking out from the mass of flowers and leaves can be viewed as the sun rises. In the midst of it all, a large willow tree spreads its massive branches over the area, colorful paper lanterns hanging within. A lush blanket of natural carpet, deep green clover spouting from the ground to form a soft pathway. The edge of the pond reaches to the edge of the path, the beginning of a breathtaking garden starting here. In the distance the calls of ducks and other wildlife can be heard. From one of the tallest tree branches, the echoing hum of busy bees sound from a golden beehive, the scent of honey filling the air with a delightful aroma.  Some earthen stone wall and an open vine entwined silver gate are here.

[Rose Gardens.]

Roses of every color imaginable bloom in full force at all times of year in this magickal garden; their sharp thorns glisten with dew drops each morning. A pitch black rosebush stands out in particular, well tended and cared for. Smooth, highly polished onyx benches rest in a few favorite sitting areas providing a comfortable spot for admiring the plants. In the very center of the garden rests a black marble fountain, carved in the shape of a massive, winged Dragon. At the fountain base a small Secian statue stands alongside the Dragon, the Secians wings veined with sparkling ruby detail. Ancient trees loom overhead, providing a dark canopy of leaves ever changing with the seasons. At the furthest point of the garden there is a break within the trees, here the air is calm and still. A blanket of clover and moss create the ideal setting for a picnic or stargazing when the night is clear.  A flowing marble dragon statue fountian, some highly polished onyx benches, and an open rose etched onyx gate are here.

This area is illuminated.
You see the 1st black and white spotted dalmation puppy (wearing a small gold collar) and the 1st flying squirrel (wearing a small gold collar).
In the area are Equality the Noble Secian, Tiamat the Drake, Mahtina the Noble Secian, Miriel the Secian, Midnight the Noble Secian, and Darrow the Secian (holding a glowing radiant crystalla dragon's tear jewel).

Tall trees with fresh fruit hanging from their massive branches dominate the area. A cheery tree house decorated in bright yellow rests in the branches of the largest tree. Almost every imaginable type of sweet produce can be found in the orchard, ranging from peaches to blackberries. A few stray baskets left within the orchard are filled to the brim with newly harvested fruits. A trellis rests off to one side, vines of grapes entwined about the frame. Under the trellis some multicolored wildflowers have taken root, growing tall with each passing season. Patches of sun-ripened red strawberries line the cobblestone pathway towards a moderately sized home, the outside done in black marble with a pair of large windows on either side of the onyx rose embossed moonsilver door.  An earthen woven wicker basket, a white grape vine trellis , a patched succulent strawberries, a closed rose embossed moonsilver door, and a large willow tree are here.

A wooden rocking chair sits in front of the hearth, next to it stands a baby bassinet adorned with a crystal dove mobile. On the mantel sits a lovely brass framed painting, on either side are two small brass vases filled with yellow baby roses. Yellow gossamer curtains adorn the windows, and a matching gossamer comforter graces a large brass framed sleigh bed that sits against the opposite wall. A plush yellow rug muffles every footstep.

A thick red velvet comforter rests beneath a few black satin pillows, matching equally dark sheets of silk. The walls are painted with wisps of ebony, gray, and white, creating the illusion of clouds. An intricate coffee table with beautiful rose carvings rests in the center of the room atop a plush black rug with red tassels. Having little access to natural light, many candles of various shades of red keep the area lit with a soft glow, setting a warm atmosphere. Fresh cut white and red roses rest in dark crystal vases upon cherry wood shelves built into the wall giving the area a light floral scent.

The style of this gorgeous room is elegant with a romantic flair. A dark cherry wood four post bed dominates the far corner with opaque black draperies hanging down, nearly reaching the floor. A thick red velvet comforter rests beneath a few black satin pillows, matching equally dark sheets of silk. The walls are painted with wisps of ebony, gray, and white, creating the illusion of clouds. An intricate coffee table with beautiful rose carvings rests in the center of the room atop a plush black rug with red tassels. Having little access to natural light, many candles of various shades of red keep the area lit with a soft glow, setting a warm atmosphere. Fresh cut white and red roses rest in dark crystal vases upon cherry wood shelves built into the wall giving the area a light floral scent.  A black draped four-post bed, an open rose carved cherry closet, a rose detailed cherry coffee table, and a black diamond-studded silver treasure chest are here.

Moonsilver molding with black diamond trim stands out against the elegant black marble of this room. A long deep black velvet rug covers the length of the floor; sewn with silver thread it depicts a lone black dragon soaring the night time sky. Ruby silk drapes frame an arched window that reaches almost to the floor. Soft, feather stuffed velvet cushions done in silver and ruby rest in front of the window. On a stand of onyx sits a polished moonsilver telescope positioned next to the cushions to look up into the heavens. A soft overstuffed ruby velvet love seat sits between shelves that have been carved into the marble wall. Warm light fills the room from black beeswax candles placed upon a myriad of moonsilver pedestals. The subtle sent of cloves hangs sweetly in the air.  A pair of ruby and silver velvet cushions, a polished moonsilver telescope, a soft ruby velvet overstuffed love seat, an elegant moonsilver serving tray, an elegant crystal candy dish, some carved black marble shelves, and an open rose embossed moonsilver door are here.

Tall trees with fresh fruit hanging from their massive branches dominate the area. A cheery tree house decorated in bright yellow rests in the branches of the largest tree. Almost every imaginable type of sweet produce can be found in the orchard, ranging from peaches to blackberries. A few stray baskets left within the orchard are filled to the brim with newly harvested fruits. A trellis rests off to one side, vines of grapes entwined about the frame. Under the trellis some multicolored wildflowers have taken root, growing tall with each passing season. Patches of sun-ripened red strawberries line the cobblestone pathway towards a moderately sized home, the outside done in black marble with a pair of large windows on either side of the onyx rose embossed moonsilver door.  An earthen woven wicker basket, a white grape vine trellis , a patched succulent strawberries, an open rose embossed moonsilver door, and a large willow tree are here.

[Rose Gardens.]

Roses of every color imaginable bloom in full force at all times of year in this magickal garden; their sharp thorns glisten with dew drops each morning. A pitch black rosebush stands out in particular, well tended and cared for. Smooth, highly polished onyx benches rest in a few favorite sitting areas providing a comfortable spot for admiring the plants. In the very center of the garden rests a black marble fountain, carved in the shape of a massive, winged Dragon. At the fountain base a small Secian statue stands alongside the Dragon, the Secians wings veined with sparkling ruby detail. Ancient trees loom overhead, providing a dark canopy of leaves ever changing with the seasons. At the furthest point of the garden there is a break within the trees, here the air is calm and still. A blanket of clover and moss create the ideal setting for a picnic or stargazing when the night is clear.  A flowing marble dragon statue fountian and some highly polished onyx benches are here.

Most who are escorted south along Law Road are the criminals and ne'er-do-wells of the Spur, while those travel along Shoteron Way are the upper class residents whom live further east.

[Right Street.]

A large wagon sits on the side of the street, its load having shifted and then toppled over. A Usil driver yells at his two Oog-ra helpers, explaining to them that the armoire should be sitting upright and not on its side. They scratch themselves in confusion, and you can hear them muttering something about leaving it on its side, so it does not fall again. There will be a resident who is unhappy with their purchase this evening.  A street lantern is here.

A neatly trimmed hedge with a small strip of grass fronts the road that travels between the Spurian Housing District and the center of town. A well dressed Frontacian woman hurries along the path as two immaculately dressed Guards lead a criminal towards the jail. She sniffs in a haughty manner, and tips her hat down so she does not have to view the filth of the city.  A street lantern is here.

A polished wooden bench sits in front of a neatly trimmed hedge. It is the perfect spot for those who wish to rest and allow their pets or children to play along the grass fronting the roadway. A small stone well complete with a dipper stands ready to slake the thirst of those who travel this way or who need a breather.  A small stone well and a street lantern are here.

[Town Square.]

The elegant Hotel Royale towers above the street, its emerald door sparkling in the light. The patrons that stroll in and out are catered to, doors opened and closed for them, and baggage and packages carried by harried servants. The large Bank of Spur sits on the east side of the square. Its location close to the Royale is not a coincidence. A gold-trimmed door is proof of the success of this branch of the Spurian bank and those who run it.  An elegant gold-trimmed walnut door, open emerald steel door, and a street lantern are here.

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.   A flowing white marble fountain, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a cracked marble statue of a Human, a carved marble statue of a Dragon, a rosewood sign, some flaming ruby ashes, a deep fluffy snow drift, and an open canvas sack are here.

[Town Square Center.]

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.   A flowing white marble fountain, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a cracked marble statue of a Human, a carved marble statue of a Dragon, a rosewood sign, some flaming ruby ashes, a deep fluffy snow drift, and an open canvas sack are here.

They scratch themselves in confusion, and you can hear them muttering something about leaving it on its side, so it does not fall again.
