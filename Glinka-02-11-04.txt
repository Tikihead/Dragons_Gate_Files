[Open plains]

The few lone fir trees that once stood mighty in this open plain have been broken in half and thrown casually to the side. The earth has been ripped up, exposing the dark black soil underneath. Several piles of grass, moss, rocks, and soil are piled in various directions, remnants of the freshly excavated ground. The giant hole leading into the ground reveals a dense curtain of thorny roots, surrounded by a multitude of strange symbols.  A light branch, some broken fir trees, a freshly expanded hole, a towering mound of soil, a towering mound of soil, a towering mound of soil, a towering mound of freshly dug earth, a towering mound of freshly dug earth, and a newly excavated opening are here.

It has a head, 2 arms, 2 legs and wings.

It appears to be in good shape.
It is currently 100' above the ground.
It will be very hard for you to hit and it will be easy for it to hit you!

You are near the southern edge of the plains. Butterflies flit across the top of the lush grass here while bees are busy in the wildflowers. The plains teem with life. The breeze from the north brings the scent of the mountain forest to your nose. High above, a freshly painted tree house rests in the leafy canopy darkness of trees in the area. A small welcome sign and a mailbox with the name Faraway carved into it sit next to a grand maple tree.  A large maple tree, a closed mailbox, and a closed dark mahogany door are here.

Swollen beyond its banks, the once small creek is now a rushing overflowing river. What used to be the charred footbridge is now a safe haven for fish well down river, nothing left of its structure. Set well into the bank of the river is a long steel pole. Lashed to the pole is a heavy rope. The voice of the riverboat captain can be heard echoing across the water, taking command and moving his cargo.  A flowing river, a freshly painted sign, some carved oak benches, a snow angel, and a pile of snow are here.

Lined with wooden seats, this slim oak boat looks to be able to carry its passengers relatively quickly to their destination. A sturdy rope is threaded through a steel eyelet that rises about two feet above the bow of the boat. The captain's muscles strain with each heave-ho on the rope, as the boat cleaves through the deep waters of the river. A thick mist circles about the river and the boat as it very slowly is pulled across the river.  A wooden railing and an exit are here.

The footbridge that once connected this path to its match on the other side of the overflowing rushing river is now nothing more then a few charred pilings. Tiny insects buzz around their remains, finding a comfortable new home. Lashed to the remains of one of the more sturdy pilings is a tall steel pole. Wrapped around the pole, and tied securely is a taut rope. Bobbing ever so lightly due to the strain of the riverboat, the rope holds tight.  A flowing river, a freshly painted sign, some carved oak benches, and a riverboat are here.

[Riverside.]

The footbridge that once connected this path to its match on the other side of the overflowing rushing river is now nothing more then a few charred pilings. Tiny insects buzz around their remains, finding a comfortable new home. Lashed to the remains of one of the more sturdy pilings is a tall steel pole. Wrapped around the pole, and tied securely is a taut rope. Bobbing ever so lightly due to the strain of the riverboat, the rope holds tight.  A flowing river, a freshly painted sign, some carved oak benches, a riverboat, and a tiny shrunken skull pendant are here.

The open plains are becoming scattered with scraggly trees, the wood of which proving inefficient to use for building as the elements of nature have grown the trunks so twisted and hard in order to withstand the onslaughts of time. Circling around the northern base of a small hill, there lies the lapping edge of the swamp to the south. Small slimy creatures lie on the smooth stones near the water, darting into it at the speed of light as you near them with tiny splashes and echoing wakes blending into the small, gentle waves coming into the shore. Swarms of mosquitoes move along the land in unison, lending them the appearance of large, unified bodies hovering around for the next feast.

Small slimy creatures lie on the smooth stones near the water, darting into it at the speed of light as you near them with tiny splashes and echoing wakes blending into the small, gentle waves coming into the shore. Swarms of mosquitoes move along the land in unison, lending them the appearance of large, unified bodies hovering around for the next feast.

A hedge of spiky brambles forms a natural division from the lands and the swampy terrain to the south. Tall, limbless trees dot the horizon there, their bases lost in the misty depths of the gases hovering over the waters. Now and then a strange, growling sound echos up to the north, or an odd, high-pitched call of some unseen crow, probably feasting on a fallen creature hidden in the mists. The path curves away from the sounds, as popular choice has preferred to travel around the edges, rather than through the marshy sludge.

A wooden signpost gives the directions and distances to the two closest cities. The arrow leading west is denoted as Spur, while the one directing east states Caersech. Next to the signpost rests an elderly druid amidst a cushion of moss, leaves, and flower petals. He is currently lecturing a young apprentice on the city of Spur and the negative effects it has had on nature.

Set within a wide tunnel leading through the hedge to the north is the Wilderness Gate. It separates the settled lands of Spur from the open plains to the south of the city. The plains stretch as far as the eyes can see, the horizon and the walls of the fort down the road the only blemishes of the grassy landscape in the distance. The stones of the road are smoothly set together, well built to withstand heavy travel.

Set within a wide tunnel leading through the hedge to the north is the Wilderness Gate. It separates the settled lands of Spur from the open plains to the south of the city. The plains stretch as far as the eyes can see, the horizon and the walls of the fort down the road the only blemishes of the grassy landscape in the distance. The stones of the road are smoothly set together, well built to withstand heavy travel.

The tradeway runs across the open grasslands northeast towards the Spur, and southwest towards distant lands and eventually, the coast. The plains to the south and east seem totally indifferent to your existence. Just ahead, a small path moves up a village of huts spread out in a semi-circle. In the center of the village a giant fire pit sits where barbarians who wander through the village can sit around to stay warm.  A worn grassy path is here.

The stone paved tradeway stretches across the open plains, interrupting nature's task of consuming the land. An endless sea of grass surrounds you, lapping at the road much like the tides against a beach. The faintly damp wind occasionally blowing in from the west smells of earth. Some of the stones in the road interlock together to form the crude image of a lion. There is no discerning if it was done on purpose or sheer accident.

Only the well-built, stone tradeway gives any hint of civilization ever having had any presence here. The tall grasses limit visibility nearby, hiding any wildlife that may be waiting for prey to stumble too close. A few blades of grass sway slightly in the breeze, some of them broken by the passing of something heavy over them. One of the larger stones in the road, broken loose from its mortar, waits patiently to be repaired.

The grass rises taller and taller in every direction further limiting view just off the roadside. A second glance reveals that this is the lowest point in a large, shallow depression. The tradeway sinks a little lower as it gets closer to the river off to the west. A ditch runs alongside the river's side of the road, small puddles of water filling the bottom. Trickles filter into the puddles from the grass beyond as mosquitoes dart across the muddy surfaces.

Rising up out of the plains, a large walled fort receives the end of the stone road. The river flows from either side, running through the fort from this angle of view. The vegetation surrounding the tradeway at this point has been burned out recently, allowing a clear field of vision from the tops of the walls ahead. The stones show little wear from the heavy traffic of feet and wheels alike; it has certainly been well constructed.

Two guards patrol above the gate, looking you over carefully before giving leave to pass through the heavy wood gate. Thick and long wooden ladders serve up to the guard's posts high in the sky so that they may have some relief from their duties overlooking the land and city. Through the slates of the wooden walkways, you can make out four archers playing a game of cards, weapons at the ready. A whip cracks loudly as a caravan heads out the gate towards Spur.

Caylith says, "Though I know who broke some of the gems."

Gwen shakes her head from side to side to you.

Losmir shakes his head from side to side to you.

Caylith says, "They were found all over"

Losmir says to Glinka, "They were found around Aradath"

You nod softly.

Mirrdae says, "A mage with a vendetta against dragonkyn planted them."

Losmir says to Mirrdae, "Often they were accompanied by Undead.  Though not always"

Losmir nods up and down to Mirrdae.

Caylith says, "Vermithrax found two in the fungus caverns. Brownies had one in Treehavem"

Mirrdae says, "I know not if the mage was taken care of."

Gwen murmurs if that is the real story.

Aliyah asks, "that mage would be?"

Aliyah ponders the meaning of the universe for a moment.

Caylith says, "They caused the monsters to swarm"

Losmir says to Mirrdae, "I haven't heard anything about him"

Mirrdae says, "I saw this mage and fought his minions."

Caylith says, "Hold on."

Losmir says to Aliyah, "Vesenil, I believe his name was..."

Mirrdae says, "Regardless, the gems turned out to be wyvern eggs."

Losmir says, "Though I could be mistaken"

Caylith nods to Losmir.

Losmir says, "Another Human"

Mirrdae says to Losmir, "Yes. That was it."

Gwen says, "You get ahead of yourselves."

Caylith nods.

Caylith says, "Now, when the oval gems first appeared we collected up all that were found and took them to Chadwick."

Losmir nods to Caylith.

Caylith says to Aliyah, "That is when the mage appeared."

Gwen whispers, "Vesenil planted the eggs, gems as we thought them at the time. The eggs started reacting, lovingly to secians, agresively to dragons. They made the dragons really mad, so some of them were broken."

Aliyah ponders the meaning of the universe for a moment.

Aliyah nods.
wh to gw oh !
You whisper to Gwen.

Caylith says, "He claimed that they were a parasite called Skull Scarabs and that they were after you Little Ones."

Aliyah asks, "where did they first start appearing?"

Aliyah asks, "who claimed that?  Chadwick or the Mage?"

Caylith says, "The Mage"

Losmir says, "The mage"

Aliyah asks, "the name of this Mage?"

Caylith says, "Vesenil"

Caylith says, "Of the School of Fire"

Aliyah's glowing hand-painted glass shadow box flickers for a moment.

Gwen whispers, "eventually we knew they were wyvern eggs, and we returned the ones we had. But the war between dragons and wyverns was rekindled. So the wyverns seek to take the lair from us, as we took their eggs from them"

Losmir ponders the meaning of the universe for a moment.

Aliyah nods slowly.

Gwen whispers, "(they don't listen about the mage)"

Caylith nods to Losmir.

Aliyah says, "the wyvern that has been speaking to us has been from Malevous"

Aliyah nods slowly.

The thick maned black stallion paces nervously.

Gwen says to Aliyah, "I didn't speak to a wyvern, only Mal"

Mirrdae says, "And now we must deal with them."

Losmir nods to Aliyah.

Mirrdae frowns thoughtfully.

Gwen says to Losmir, "Maybe because Nori cannot come herself, or because Nori hasn't been seen, and the conflict of dragon and wyvern involves imperials, not just drakes and dracos"

The eagle spreads its wings slightly and balances on one foot to clear the bloody remains of its last meal from its razor-sharp talons.

Aliyah, A smile hovering on her lips, just appeared.

Caylith says, "The thing is the wyverns have all the eggs expect for the one magickally hatched by Vesenil"

Aliyah ponders the meaning of the universe for a moment.

Losmir nods to Gwen.

The eagle spreads its wings.

Gwen asks Caylith, "Even the one that was held by an elf?"

Caylith says, "Ceresina's was the last one I think"

Losmir says to Caylith, "But they know that.  We've been trying to tell them that"

Gwen nods.

Caylith asks, "An elf has one?"

Mirrdae says to Caylith, "I have come under the impression that even if we could, returning that one won't help."

Caylith says, "It won't."

Losmir nods to Mirrdae.

Gwen grumbles.

Caylith says, "They want the lair. They told me such"

Losmir says, "The eggs were just a nice excuse"

The thick maned black stallion paces nervously.

Mirrdae says to Caylith, "So we either give it to them or lose it to them."

Mirrdae says, "A disgusting choice."

Caylith says, "The eggs were the catalyst to set it all ablaze"

The eagle spreads its wings.

Aliyah says, "and we cann't get in there to save Norius'a's belongings"

Mirrdae says to Aliyah, "We can. The lair isn't closed to us."

Gwen whispers, "from upstairs: I hate to do this, but Afton'a is an OOC entity. Be cool about it, but steer things away from that road :)"

Mirrdae says, "But some of the things cannot be moved."

The inside of this great tree is naturally hollow. Many bright windows fill the knots and holes of the sturdy old trunk, providing cheery light. The hollow of one particularly large root has been carefully lined with stone to make a cozy fireplace. A sturdy oak table stands as the rooms center piece, surrounded by soft fluffy pillows of all kinds. Bookshelves filled with texts of history, lore and rune magick line the many curves of the walls. Several well worn candles stand as testament to the resident's extensive study habits. In a quiet nook stands a simple alter bearing the mark of a dragon.  A closed antique oak chest, a closed crystal door, and a basket of baked goods are here.

The inside of this great tree is naturally hollow. Many bright windows fill the knots and holes of the sturdy old trunk, providing cheery light. The hollow of one particularly large root has been carefully lined with stone to make a cozy fireplace. A sturdy oak table stands as the rooms center piece, surrounded by soft fluffy pillows of all kinds. Bookshelves filled with texts of history, lore and rune magick line the many curves of the walls. Several well worn candles stand as testament to the resident's extensive study habits. In a quiet nook stands a simple alter bearing the mark of a dragon.  A closed antique oak chest, a closed crystal door, and a basket of baked goods are here.

Tall, sculpted hedges and well groomed gardens decorate the front lawns of various cottages. A cool breeze glides in from the south rustling the branches of a near by oak tree and carrying on it the smell of water. Set into the southern corner is a small, sturdy door. It leads into a small tower that barely rises up over the stockade around it.  An oak tree, some small stone cottages, a closed Leuian crafted koy door, a closed wrought iron gate, a closed silver-trimmed etched glass door, and an open magickal violet gate are here.

Within the heart of this proud fort one can see all around that the reconstruction of its buildings has begun. Large stones and logs have been stacked and piled, while some workers tirelessly attempt to repair the damage that occurred here during the Lords of Chaos wars. The buildings and homes of the people that resided here are slowly taking shape, though, far from completed. The smell of dyes, used to paint the town, permeate the area.  A breathtaking shimmering bouquet of moonflowers, an open light blue door, and a glowing wrought iron street lantern are here.

Two guards patrol above the gate, looking you over carefully before giving leave to pass through the heavy wood gate. Thick and long wooden ladders serve up to the guard's posts high in the sky so that they may have some relief from their duties overlooking the land and city. Through the slates of the wooden walkways, you can make out four archers playing a game of cards, weapons at the ready. A whip cracks loudly as a caravan heads out the gate towards Spur.

Rising up out of the plains, a large walled fort receives the end of the stone road. The river flows from either side, running through the fort from this angle of view. The vegetation surrounding the tradeway at this point has been burned out recently, allowing a clear field of vision from the tops of the walls ahead. The stones show little wear from the heavy traffic of feet and wheels alike; it has certainly been well constructed.

The tradeway sinks a little lower as it gets closer to the river off to the west. A ditch runs alongside the river's side of the road, small puddles of water filling the bottom. Trickles filter into the puddles from the grass beyond as mosquitoes dart across the muddy surfaces.

Only the well-built, stone tradeway gives any hint of civilization ever having had any presence here. The tall grasses limit visibility nearby, hiding any wildlife that may be waiting for prey to stumble too close. A few blades of grass sway slightly in the breeze, some of them broken by the passing of something heavy over them. One of the larger stones in the road, broken loose from its mortar, waits patiently to be repaired.

Only the well-built, stone tradeway gives any hint of civilization ever having had any presence here. The tall grasses limit visibility nearby, hiding any wildlife that may be waiting for prey to stumble too close. A few blades of grass sway slightly in the breeze, some of them broken by the passing of something heavy over them. One of the larger stones in the road, broken loose from its mortar, waits patiently to be repaired.

You see the 1st thick maned black stallion (wearing a small gold collar) and the 1st eagle (wearing a small gold collar).
In the area are Losmir the Draco, Caylith the Drake (an eagle upon her left shoulder), Gwen the Secian, and Mirrdae the Drake.

The stone paved tradeway stretches across the open plains, interrupting nature's task of consuming the land. An endless sea of grass surrounds you, lapping at the road much like the tides against a beach. The faintly damp wind occasionally blowing in from the west smells of earth. Some of the stones in the road interlock together to form the crude image of a lion. There is no discerning if it was done on purpose or sheer accident.

The tradeway runs across the open grasslands northeast towards the Spur, and southwest towards distant lands and eventually, the coast. The plains to the south and east seem totally indifferent to your existence. Just ahead, a small path moves up a village of huts spread out in a semi-circle. In the center of the village a giant fire pit sits where barbarians who wander through the village can sit around to stay warm.  A worn grassy path is here.

Set within a wide tunnel leading through the hedge to the north is the Wilderness Gate. It separates the settled lands of Spur from the open plains to the south of the city. The plains stretch as far as the eyes can see, the horizon and the walls of the fort down the road the only blemishes of the grassy landscape in the distance. The stones of the road are smoothly set together, well built to withstand heavy travel. A broken wagon wheel, discarded some time ago, covers a spot of nearby grass, weeds trying to climb through the spokes.

A wooden signpost gives the directions and distances to the two closest cities. The arrow leading west is denoted as Spur, while the one directing east states Caersech. Next to the signpost rests an elderly druid amidst a cushion of moss, leaves, and flower petals. He is currently lecturing a young apprentice on the city of Spur and the negative effects it has had on nature.

A hedge of spiky brambles forms a natural division from the lands and the swampy terrain to the south. Tall, limbless trees dot the horizon there, their bases lost in the misty depths of the gases hovering over the waters. Now and then a strange, growling sound echos up to the north, or an odd, high-pitched call of some unseen crow, probably feasting on a fallen creature hidden in the mists. The path curves away from the sounds, as popular choice has preferred to travel around the edges, rather than through the marshy sludge.

The open plains are becoming scattered with scraggly trees, the wood of which proving inefficient to use for building as the elements of nature have grown the trunks so twisted and hard in order to withstand the onslaughts of time. Circling around the northern base of a small hill, there lies the lapping edge of the swamp to the south. Small slimy creatures lie on the smooth stones near the water, darting into it at the speed of light as you near them with tiny splashes and echoing wakes blending into the small, gentle waves coming into the shore. Swarms of mosquitoes move along the land in unison, lending them the appearance of large, unified bodies hovering around for the next feast.

A sudden shift in the wind brings forth the sullied aroma of death and decay from the swamp southern lands. Slurpish noises belie the path of some creature traveling through the muddy scape, their movements hidden behind the smoky mist that reduces visibility to a mere few feet past the swamp's edge.

Ravens dark as pitch spread their feathers to a wing-span of nearly four feet, so large they are, as they quarrel over an abandoned mule carcass on the roadside breaks out. How final death seems, so casually nature simply encompasses the bodies of the fallen, through carrion hunters or moldy decay. Yet through death there be life again, any number of these ravens being sustained through this death, so they may live. Perhaps only to become sustenance for one of the swamp creatures, who, in turn, spends its life continuing the cycle.

Stepping near the orb to investigate closer only causes it to again blink out of existence, forming once more, deeper into the mists. It soon becomes apparent that the mysterious lights are attempting to slyly lead you into the swamp. To or for what purpose, is the question.

A thick mist circles about the river and the boat as it very slowly is pulled across the river.  A wooden railing and an exit are here.

[Riverboat.]

Lined with wooden seats, this slim oak boat looks to be able to carry its passengers relatively quickly to their destination. A sturdy rope is threaded through a steel eyelet that rises about two feet above the bow of the boat.

The river laps against this small dirt clearing. Foliage grows a healthy green next to the water. Smooth washed pebbles along with pieces of branches and leaves all clutter the dirt riverbank.  A small bird twitters in a singsong voice high in the trees. Just off to the west a little stone bridge spans the river.

A number of small saplings dot the ground between the black trunks. Between the stream bank and oaks, a small path of four-leaf-clover shaped stones weave a windy path through the forest.  A stone bridge, a wooden bridge, a clump of wildgrass, and a small winding stone path are here.

A fine haze of dust hovers over the remains of the Silver Owl Inn. Through the fallen timbers and memories of lives lost, one can see brilliant green sprouts reaching for sunlight. A tiny songbird perches on an old stick of furniture poking through the rubble, singing sweetly to herald new life and hope. A small winding path of stones placed in the shape of four leaf clovers winds itself through the forest.  A small winding stone pathway and a charred ancient steelwood tree are here.

The path of four leaf clove shaped flagstones leads past a small clean shack and into a well formed tunnel through the thorn bushes to the east and the Caersech to the west. The small shack is set back from the road, its walls built of a whitewashed birch. A sturdy corral, filled with well-fed horses, stands to the left of the shack. A matched pair of dapple grays stand in front of the shack waiting to take their human baggage to their destination. To the left of the door, behind a small paned window, a beautiful Fir Elf female takes coin and in return, with a charming smile, directs those who have paid their fare into the waiting room.  A small shack, a freshly painted sign, a notice of non-refund, and a small winding stone pathway are here.

Contrasting starkly with the ashes of the forest and brush is a freshly constructed set of stairs that wraps itself about the large tree. The intricate woodwork that decorates the steps is of the finest quality, as if in parody to the blackened destruction of the hedges and brambles around the base of the trunk. Bright green leaves of clover have begun springing up through the ashy soil in conjunction with soft moss to lend a durable cushion to this well-traveled spot.  Some steps circling the tree, a freshly painted wooden sign, a healthy green patch of clover, a flowing marble fountain, and some clover shaped stones are here.

A staircase here seems to have some enchantment, judging by the strange appearance of unicorns, bears and owls on the lower steps. Strange, due to the fact that they don't appear carved, painted, or put there by any hand-made means. It is as if the glyphs grew into the wood itself. Mysterious symbols are scattered throughout the portraits, which shimmer with a golden whisper as they are approached.

The delicate shadings of the plants is perfectly natural, and as the eye becomes unfocused, a picture of a diminutive, beautiful maiden sits amongst a foresty background. The wall opposite of this magnificent tapestry is lined with portraits of prominent temple leaders, the colors vibrant, bringing a life-like sense to the frames. The eyes of the maiden in the tapestry seem to follow you, staring directly as you pass, boring into your soul.
