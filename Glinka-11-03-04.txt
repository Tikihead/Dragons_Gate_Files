Large branches hang down from above, casting dark shadows across the forest floor.  With every rustle of the breeze they seem to take on a life of their own, almost to the point of distracting you from the deep ravine that lies ahead, obscured by the gnarly undergrowth.  A mossy rotting log, a crooked crumbling stone bridge, and a dark path are here.

A bored Flerian, leaning against the city wall, glances at you with hooded eyes as you pass by. He turns and slinks through a small hole at the base of the wall. Beautiful golden grasslands grow in a large clearing to the west.

Four draft horses stomp at the ground in annoyance as two miners struggle with the broken wheel of a horse-cart, filled to the top with glittering dark ore. One heavily muscled Hithual curses fluently in Battle as he attempts to leverage the cart with a plank from its own sideboard. The attempt to thread the axle with a new wheel fails, setting off shouts of pain and frustration.

Travelers from Rathan to the northwest, and the Trade Route to the south, converge at Spur's west gate. Guards posted on the ground give those seeking to enter the city a cursory once-over. Their lack of interest shows that anyone approaching has already been observed from above for some time. A grate in the ground loosens mud from wagon wheels and hooves before they pass through the gate, helping to keep the streets of Spur fairly clean.  An open giant black iron gate, a giant green oak tree, a small blue pool, a thick oak grate over the pool, and a polished stone marker are here.

Connecting the two is a merchant road built long ago.

The tall, shaded forest breaks like a green tinged wave upon the tranquil calm of the grasslands. The huge trees within are ancient, reaching hundreds of feet into the air. As if steaming from a great cauldron, a heavy ground fog seeps from deep within the forest carrying with it the fresh smell of decomposing green matter.

The pool is damned by a small hillock which allows no drainage so the pool remains stagnant. The mountains to the north reflect in perfectly upside-down symmetry on the still pond's surface, only wavering slightly in concentric circles to the deft touch of small insects.

Their roots protectively sheltered from the weather, idiosyntric sprouts of taller grasses thrive haphazardly inside the wheel. Several tiny holes top small pyramids of sandy debris, where a few red fire ants scout their wagon-wheel domain for fodder.

As the road bends around a curve, ruts left by merchant's wagons cut so deeply into the mud that all wheeled vehicles are forced to follow the set path. Four loaded wagons of a merchants caravan stand idle as one larger than standard wagon skitters along the path. The buckboard's frame groans and strains to keep it inline while the driver attempts to negotiate the turn. Four dark maned, matched mules balk at the noise behind them, and stomp nervously over the deep ruts. The liveried caravan guards attempt to haul the mules forward, further adding to the mules stubborn refusal to move.

The road charges across a flat valley through waving stalks of grain with coppery tinted seeds. Around the northern edge grows a row of huge cypress trees with trunks that measure eight feet across. Debris from the trees' self-trimming mats the taller grasses into an impenetrable wall. The cypresses produce the necessary windbreak for the field to bear the heavy headed grain.

The worn merchants road travels the southern side of a low hill in one wide arc. The broad path is slightly banked to accomodate for the turn and incline. On the exposed side of the road, the sturdy road-bed is exposed to the elements and yet has remained solid. A neatly kept plank house with a stone well and fenced paddock overlooks grain fields to the southeast.

Broadening to fill the lee of a wide valley, the roadway passes by several temporary campsites where caravans have bolstered the existing comforts for their temporary encampments. Neat stacks of foraged sticks and axe-hewn firewood sit adjacent to the blackened rocks of two impromptu fire rings. Freshly dug midden pits waft clues to the camp's frequent use into the clean mountain air.

Just to the north, the roadway curves gently around a bend in a large river that flows towards the southeast. An enormous smooth round rock splits off a small eddy from the main current resulting a deep, clear pool by the eastern side of the road. The cool calm water catches the reflection of the white snowcapped mountain range further up the valley while the river rushes past towards Spur. Five fishermen recline on folding chairs or against rocks, tethered by the silvery lines of their poles to the fishing hole. Each fisherman is spread evenly around the pool as if held apart by some invisible barrier as they eye the large shadowy fish shapes finning effortlessly against the mild current in the eddy.

Deeply grooved sled tracks lead to the east towards the bridge from this part of the road where the flatness of the valley was best suited for the staging area during the bridge's reconstruction. Smooth rectangles of tent foundations still mark their location in a semi circle around a blackened fire ring where the workers and their supervisors lived during it's rebuilding.

The decaying remains of the bridge workers camp sprawls across this flat valley. To house their draft beasts, the workers constructed small stalls and shelters from rickety boards nailed quixotically to the standing trees. Three brass ring topped posts lie sunk into the grasslands turf, to the south, which was most likely used for tethering grazing animals. Between the posts is a rough stone trough that is filled automatically with water by a rickety mechanical wind mill, whirling lazily in the breeze.

To house their draft beasts, the workers constructed small stalls and shelters from rickety boards nailed quixotically to the standing trees. Three brass ring topped posts lie sunk into the grasslands turf, to the south, which was most likely used for tethering grazing animals. Between the posts is a rough stone trough that is filled automatically with water by a rickety mechanical wind mill, whirling lazily in the breeze.

Water loving trees hug the river's course through the low lying valley. Giant beech and huge alders vie for the valuable sodden shoreline and shade the understory bushes and ferns from direct sunlight. The result is a lushly green, verdant forest that obscures the river from the view on the road, though the hiss of rushing water reveals it's course.

Running parallel to the road is a smooth rock lined trench that channels the road's run-off during rainstorms. This flat part of the road that follows the valley floor would be prone to turn into a muddy bog and therefore a hazard to most caravans and their pack animals. Anticipating this event, the road's engineers built drains into the lower side of the road that carry the runoff into the culvert, which carries it harmlessly down to the low end of the valley.

With the care and attention to detail rarely given to a mundane project such as a road, the engineers foresaw potential hazards and built the solutions into their finished project. Tracking the southern, downhill side of the road is a stone lined trough meant to solve any flooding or mud related issues.

White barked birch trees populate the moist valleys that drain into the river to the southeast as the merchant road passes nearby. The tall vertical trees reach to the sky in a beautiful dance reminiscent of dancers waving their arms gracefully to some unheard rhythm. The grain-laden grasses sway in accompaniment, and the tinkling waterfalls and babbling creeks beat like odd syncopated patterns onto the rocks.

The roadway takes advantage of a cut in the hill to negotiate a tumbled cliff face. At the top of the hill is a high, flat, steppe grassland, and at the bottom is the edge of the open range. At one point, the road narrows to cross a small stream. Very little mud gathers in the shallows of the stream and the pebbles and rocks glitter like gold as the wagon wheels churn the gravel.

Much higher up the great mountainsides a line where trees stop growing gives testament to the altitude. The air is cool.

The forest is ancient and the trunks of the trees bare witness to fires, lightning strikes and the attacks of insects. Large gout-like burls disfigure some of the wide, grey trunks which have grown quietly next to the road for hundreds of years.

Flat, yellow capped mushrooms and rippled shelf fungi sprout from the fallen trees. The pleasant aroma of healthy decomposing leaves fills the air.

Hand pounded concrete pipes, half circle in shape, channel two small streams under the chinked rock and gravel road-bed. The icy spring water bubbles down the hill and glides over a sheet of shorn granite until it fills a crystal clear pool at the bottom, far below the road. The pool's overflow creates a single clear stream that meanders towards the ancient oak forest.

A few staunch oaks grow alone or in groups of one or two, their roots exposed where they cling to the rocky soil for sustenance. Thin, scraggly junipers suck up what little moisture the soil does manage to hold. The merchant road placidly passes by, untouched by time in the dry environment.

All manner of beasts are drawn to the springs and the protection they offer. Bright blue scrub jays chatter noisily among themselves as they dart and swerve in accomplished aerial feats pursuing their winged insect meals. A small herd of wary jackrabbits stop munching the grass to turn their white ears towards the merchant road. The nearest jack to the road stands on his hind legs and tests the air for any scent of their many predators.

The merchant road swerves around a rock strewn hill. Several ancient oak trees grow in solitary wonder on the south side of the hill. Dead fall and broken branches cover the hollow and is home for a family of thick furred marmots. The dark brown colored rodents stare out of the dark recesses of the dead branches with shiny black eyes. A brace of buck-toothed, adolescent marmots scramble for cover as the shrill cry of a hawk sounds further up the mountain.

Thicker stalked grasses grow here on this high plateau where the air is rarified and rain spills quickly down the small rocky gullies. A few staunch oaks grow alone or in groups of one or two, their roots exposed where they cling to the rocky soil for sustenance. Thin, scraggly junipers suck up what little moisture the soil does manage to hold. The merchant road placidly passes by, untouched by time in the dry environment.

Bright green trees and healthy bushes stand out sporadically on the dusty steppe. The little spring fed islands are surrounded by the blue-green grasses that thrive here. All manner of beasts are drawn to the springs and the protection they offer. Bright blue scrub jays chatter noisily among themselves as they dart and swerve in accomplished aerial feats pursuing their winged insect meals. A small herd of wary jackrabbits stop munching the grass to turn their white ears towards the merchant road. The nearest jack to the road stands on his hind legs and tests the air for any scent of their many predators.

Blending perfectly with the muted hues of the arid surroundings, a lone timber wolf stalks the outer edges of the grassland about a half a mile from the merchant road. The wolf's ears are perked to listen for the rustling of the bushy tailed jack rabbits that thrive in the prairie. The wolf lifts it nose to catch a scent, howls briefly and trots off towards the southeast to catch it's prey from downwind.

Game trails cut back and forth across the merchants road covered with the split, sharp toed hoof prints of deer and elk. Dark spoor mark the trails most frequently used by the herbivores: the hunted. Sharp yipping pierces the cold, quiet air from both sides of the road: the hunters. The widely spaced junipers, scrub oaks, and mountain hawthorns offer ample cover for the pack of wolves to range unseen through the plateau.

The merchant road cuts straight through a hill where men and beasts must have toiled to remove tons of blasted rock and dirt. The choice to remove hundreds of feet of hillside was more prudent to the road engineers then a long series of switch-backs that would have to climb the steep hillside for hundreds of feet. Tube shaped holes drilled into the bedrock still remain from when the roadbed was blasted eons years ago.

The boulder is pure white crystal quartz, fractured and broken into beautiful prisms around the edges, but remains whole and pure in the center. The road marker clearly points out the cardinal directions using four arrows.   A solid brass road marker is here.

The merchant road threads through bottom of the small, narrow valley. Sheer granite walls block the view from the well traveled road to either side and above, only a narrow ray of sky testifies to the time of day. The engineers set a route as far as possible from the broken stones in the center of the valley and, by luck or design, this foresight has saved the road-bed from constant reconstruction. Small cracks run parallel to the road, but none have broken through the thick layers of sand and stone.

As the merchant road approaches the western end of the valley, the valley wall abruptly falls away to a sheer drop. Crumbling rock and dirt spill constantly into the deep abyss. Sections of the mountain have slid away into the valley and the merchant road has been rebuilt higher along the steeper sides of the mountain. The fault line of broken rocks continues its path of destruction to the west, skirted by the land-slide prone softer dirt.   A freshly uncovered crevice is here.

As the merchant road approaches the western end of the valley, the valley wall abruptly falls away to a sheer drop. Crumbling rock and dirt spill constantly into the deep abyss. Sections of the mountain have slid away into the valley and the merchant road has been rebuilt higher along the steeper sides of the mountain. The fault line of broken rocks continues its path of destruction to the west, skirted by the land-slide prone softer dirt.   A freshly uncovered crevice is here.

A treacherous dusty trail leads west along the shaky fault line from a fork in the main road. The original roadbed has fallen into the chasm years ago, leaving the merchants to their own wiles to ply the slippery slopes past the fault zone. Many attempts have failed at conquering the shifting dirt and rocks. Currently a bumpy trail skirts the bigger rocks and loose gravel.

Cutting across a wide debris path, the merchant road is barely discernible from the hemorrhage of slowly decaying mountain.  Small footprints track across the torpid river but disappear within hours. To the north, a landmark of sorts allows travelers a point from which to reconoiter their path. A mount of rocks that resembles the beak of a large bird marks the northern rim of the crater. Southbound traffic must rely on their wits to reach the badlands beyond the chasm.

For miles, gray to white polished granite dominates the rock-topped landscape with one exception. A few paces off the roadway, the hard rock dips into a small ditch that is strewn with broken rocks and marked by dark recesses. The wind whips several gossamer filaments of light stringy material out of the darker region of the ditch.

A new rent has been cut into the southeastern side of the mountain, allowing passage to the southern road.

Tough lichen and scrub pines absorb nutrients from the mineral laden run-off. The sun shines brightly on the southern exposure of the trail, sheltered from the wind and freezing cold. Bright green oases of life sprout from rocky niches and the path is slippery where the green slimy growths cross it.

The boulders bear scars from deeply driven pinions and screws used to hold cables and reins, or perhaps impromptu corrals for the portage animals. The paths that enter and exit the haven are narrow and strewn with small but heavy rocks. Any wagons drawn this far would have to be manhandled over them using cables, levers, or wedges.

A lean-to built from odds and ends serves as a way station for exhausted travelers. Gathered firewood lines the lean-to's walls, and a small darkened pit smolders outside the opening. Inside the small, cramped lean-to, light filters in through the makeshift construction. The possibility of being snowed in and sheltering for a long period in this little hovel is not a welcome proposition.

On closer inspection, hair-line fractures have appeared in the smoothly cut tunnel walls, allowing a few moist rivuletes to seep through onto the granite's surface.

Stepping stones cut across what was once a large lawn. Their destination is the rather imposing manse to the north. Weeds have choked out any grass that may have at one time existed. A cold breeze drifts across the area, even the most stoic can feel the goose bumps rising on their arms.  An open old black obsidian gate is here.

Grey stepping stones, worn with time, bisect the overgrowth of weeds. They give you access to the untended flower beds that front the mansion. Waist high weeds crowd out what visible path remains. Your best bet seems to be to aim for the front door or the gate to the south.

Entering the foyer the first thing you notice is its subtle opulence. The floor is highly polished black marble, the walls are covered with a gold stripped, cream colored paper. Light filters in through a large paned glass window which, at one time must have glistened, but is now coated with the accumulation of years of dirt. A finely crafted staircase, its balustrade polished from many years of use, rises to the second floor unsupported.  A polished oak circular staircase and some open massive black obsidian double doors are here.

Several larger head stones are set up in a circular pattern in the weed infested grass. Their sizes vary and are all intricately carved. Over half of them have overgrown flowering bushes in front of them. At one time the flowers were a beautiful sign of dedication, now they just blot out the worn wording on the stones.  A worn pink headstone, a crumbling white headstone, a large faded headstone, and a bronze hammer are here.

Dirt streaked windows look out upon what was once a beautiful lawn. The morning sun shines into them, brightening the dining room each and every morning. Below the window is a small bench covered with cushions that are starting to rot with age. A small child's toy lies on its side, wedged between two cushions, long forgotten by its owner.  A small red and white child's toy is here.

Unique fragrant flowers bloom in an array of colors, their petals sticking cloyingly to your clothes if you brush up to close to them.  A small overgrown path is here.

Stepping stones cut across what was once a large lawn. Their destination is the rather imposing manse to the north. Weeds have choked out any grass that may have at one time existed. A cold breeze drifts across the area, even the most stoic can feel the goose bumps rising on their arms.  An open old black obsidian gate is here.

An old cottage stands along the side of the road, decaying with years of disuse and exposure. The thatch roof has fallen in on the house, letting the rain and wind destroy the old structure. Green ivy grows unchecked up the wall on one side of the house, pulling the stones loose and aiding in the demise of the cottage.

The gladiators that once sat dejected and forlorn against the arch now stand proudly and alert, polishing their swords to the highest sheen, and adjusting their helms and breastplates. A long line of potential competitors and audience members alike is beginning to form, the last of whom glance uneasily in the direction of the looming cemetary before turning their attention back on the huge arena ahead.

[Condemned Walk.]

A small rivulet of blood flows down the path that leads from the north and meets up with Condemned Walk. At the end of the path lies Execution Square and its viewing stands. It is at this point that the sentenced criminals discover their fate. Many hope to battle for their lives in the arena, but for most, the sentence is execution by one of the Spurian Justices.  A street lantern is here.

People hurry on their way along the eastern road both into and out of Spur. A black clad woman holding the hands of two small children slowly walks towards the east, facing the somber task of burial. Two armored warriors, carrying tankards, are in high spirits as they head back to Town Square to share the story of their day in the arena.  A street lantern is here.

[Town Square East.]

Travel to the eastern portion of Town Square finds battle clad warriors shoulder to shoulder with chained criminals and those who live outside the Spurian Walls. The cobblestones that line the street are stained with blood.  It is unknown as to whether the blood is from guards carrying out quick executions, or gladiators who refused to wait their turn for arena space.  A street lantern and a slate grey misty fog are here.

[Town Square Center.]

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.   A flowing white marble fountain, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a marble statue of a Human, a crumbled marble statue of a Dragon, and a rosewood sign are here.

Two elegant buildings, one to the north and one to the west, stand on either side of a quickly degrading road. Nattily dressed patrons of the two establishments hurry to their destination, not pausing for fear of being robbed, or worse. To the northwest the houses steadily become more decrepit. A dark pallor of smoky air hangs heavily over the area.  A street lantern, a heavy mahogany door, and a slate grey misty fog are here.

[Bazaar Path.]

Many people crowd the narrow Bazaar Path, either heading towards the infamous Bazaar, or forcing their way back towards Trade Way. For a small price, a farmer can rent a booth and directly market his goods. Both some of the best and some of the worst deals can be made within this collection of stalls. The tall wall of Spur looms high to the east, and many of the guards take an early peek into the carts and the goods coming to market.  A street lantern is here.

Further passage along Bazaar Path is blocked occasionally by brawling peasants. Fights break out over who got here first, who gets to sell first, whose goods are better and who should just pack up and leave. When guards are forced to leave their posts to settle the arguments, all involved lose.  A street lantern is here.

The going slows down briefly as someone stops dead in their tracks. Every so often one feels the need to take in the sounds and smells that are uniquely the Bazaar. Any slow down in the movement of the crowd creates a loud string of curses. The sellers are eager to get to market to get rid of their goods, and the buyers anticipate their purchases.

A break in the traffic shows a small worn path that heads to the west. Many travel that way, sure of their ability to navigate the stalls and tents that create this market place.

At this intersection many stands display their exotic foodstuffs. Hanging from large hooks are various unidentifiable hunks of meat, and vegetables of all shapes and colors. The only thing more prevalent than the merchants and buyers are the bugs, who clamor to find the most pungent item to land on. To the northeast a small tent can barely be seen hiding behind the stalls.  A white silk tent and a street lantern are here.

The well-defined Bazaar path heads off to the west. This corner is a mix of the old and the new. On one corner an old stall is barely standing. The roof has caved in, and it quickly becomes apparent that this location has become a local dump. Pieces of wood that look suspiciously like some of the leftovers from other construction sites are piled on top of rotting offal. On the opposite corner a new tent is being erected, its high roof and vivid coloring pleasing to the eye.  An open stall and a street lantern are here.

Several large carts head west, full of various items the owners are sure will sell for a decent profit. Empty carts, the sign of a prosperous day, head east. An old Thugian pulls and pushes a very stubborn donkey. Neither end seems to be cooperating with his demands. Two small children dance around the Thugian and the donkey, chanting and singing a nasty song. Quickly, he takes out a switch, which is enough encouragement for both the donkey to move and the children to run.  A street lantern is here.

The foot traffic on Bazaar Path turns south down a small trail into the heart of the Bazaar. Many of the smaller carts follow the buyers and merchants to avoid the conflicts with the larger wagons that continue west. The shouting up ahead quickens the pulse of even the most experienced seller.  A street lantern is here.

Deep, muddy ruts mar the road. A trickle of water flows from an unknown source creating a horrid hazard. Drivers curse one another for holding up the flow of traffic. Merchants and buyers carefully pick their way around the hold up, attempting to carefully navigate the slippery ground.  A street lantern is here.

Bazaar Path makes a sudden left hand turn, following the direction of the large Spurian Wall. Carts and wagons creak in protest as their heavy loads shift precariously.  Waiting for that rare item to fall from one of the merchant carts, several small Flerian children play in the dust at the side of the road.  A street lantern is here.

A break in the traffic shows a small worn path that heads to the west. Many travel that way, sure of their ability to navigate the stalls and tents that create this market place. The larger carts and those not too sure of themselves continue to head north. A small shack sits on the eastern side of the road, its door hanging precariously on its hinges.  A street lantern is here.

The going slows down briefly as someone stops dead in their tracks. Every so often one feels the need to take in the sounds and smells that are uniquely the Bazaar. Any slow down in the movement of the crowd creates a loud string of curses. The sellers are eager to get to market to get rid of their goods, and the buyers anticipate their purchases.  A street lantern is here.

The muffled noises you hear drifting in from the west come out of the Bazaar itself, a veritable hive of activity day and night. An occasion exotic smell is carried by the breeze to tantalize the nose. A large etched window displays tastefully dressed mannequins of many races.  An open sturdy mahogany door and a street lantern are here.

Further passage along Bazaar Path is blocked occasionally by brawling peasants. Fights break out over who got here first, who gets to sell first, whose goods are better and who should just pack up and leave. When guards are forced to leave their posts to settle the arguments, all involved lose.  A street lantern is here.

[Bazaar Path.]

Many people crowd the narrow Bazaar Path, either heading towards the infamous Bazaar, or forcing their way back towards Trade Way. For a small price, a farmer can rent a booth and directly market his goods. Both some of the best and some of the worst deals can be made within this collection of stalls. The tall wall of Spur looms high to the east, and many of the guards take an early peek into the carts and the goods coming to market.  A street lantern is here.

This well-worn road separates the Bazaar to the north and Market Circle to the south. Only a Thugian could appreciate the layered odors of simmering foodstuffs and shoppers from the Bazaar. Crowds of people push past, some brushing against you. It might be a good idea to keep an eye on your coinpurse.  A street lantern is here.

The buildings of Market Circle stand to the south. It becomes obvious that the area through the arch is a much cleaner marketplace than the bazaar. An inviting eatery stands beside the road, its door open to those weary after a long trip to Spur, as well as those preparing to venture to the great expanses beyond the west gate. A human couple exit the building, arm in arm. A small sign stands beside the intersection.  A sign, an open glossy lacquered oak door, and a street lantern are here.

Situated between the well-traveled Trade Way to the north and the fine shops of Market Circle to the south, this small stretch of road is busy at all times of day. Adventurers with sacks of plundered goods leave Market Street and head west where a shrewd businessman has set up shop in this busy area of the Market District. A small shop stands slightly to the east of the arch leading into Merchant Circle, light shining through its red glass door and illuminating the store front in a cheerful, ruby glow.  A street lantern, an opaque ruby red glass door, and a gold lettered wooden sign are here.

An arch between two large buildings connects Market Circle and Market Street. The more reputable shopkeepers do business within the circle, but pay higher taxes for the privilege. The buildings have been built to last, as these merchants are no traveling tinkers. Interlocking stone walkways and colorful plantings span this central area. Despite the number of animals waiting outside the bank for their owners, the area is spotless. Loud chatter in many languages can be heard from the southwest.  A marble archway, an open elegant gold-trimmed walnut door, and a wooden sign are here.

Situated between the well-traveled Trade Way to the north and the fine shops of Market Circle to the south, this small stretch of road is busy at all times of day. Adventurers with sacks of plundered goods leave Market Street and head west where a shrewd businessman has set up shop in this busy area of the Market District. A small shop stands slightly to the east of the arch leading into Merchant Circle, light shining through its red glass door and illuminating the store front in a cheerful, ruby glow.  A street lantern, an opaque ruby red glass door, and a gold lettered wooden sign are here.

The buildings of Market Circle stand to the south. It becomes obvious that the area through the arch is a much cleaner marketplace than the bazaar. An inviting eatery stands beside the road, its door open to those weary after a long trip to Spur, as well as those preparing to venture to the great expanses beyond the west gate. A human couple exit the building, arm in arm. A small sign stands beside the intersection.  A sign, an open glossy lacquered oak door, and a street lantern are here.

The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.

Travel to the eastern portion of Town Square finds battle clad warriors shoulder to shoulder with chained criminals and those who live outside the Spurian Walls.

The occasional bright flash of light from inside the store suggests all kinds of strange and rare magicks are being cast inside!

A massive circular stone platform stands to the side of Magick Lane, strangely entrancing runes carved on every inch of its sides.
