An enormous circle of smooth oak columns create the walls of the Great Room. From the door, the hard-packed floor descends to a blazing fire pit with aromatic woods such as apple wood, orange and juniper. Fragrant braided sweet-grass mats are placed randomly around the fire pit. Horn sconces bearing beeswax candles emit a soft light, which permeates the room. A simple, yet elegant redwood plaque adorns the far wall. Carved into this plaque is a dedication. A golden flag is prominently displayed against one wall. Mounted above the grand oak door is a leather banner that has "Walk in Honor" branded into it. A Saldaean crafted, walnut weapons case stands in the corner of the room. Various Leuian symbols are hammered into the moonsilver panels adorning the case's doors. A highly polished, maple pantry sits next to the weapons case and bears the mark of the Leuian warrior on each of it's doors.  An open polished maple pantry, an open Leuian crafted oak trunk, an open Saldean crafted walnut weapons case, a redwood plaque, a golden flag, a Leuian carved koy wood archway, and an open star embossed leather door are here.

An enormous circle of smooth oak columns create the walls of the Great Room.

Fragrant braided sweet-grass mats are placed randomly around the fire pit. Horn sconces bearing beeswax candles emit a soft light, which permeates the room. A simple, yet elegant redwood plaque adorns the far wall. Carved into this plaque is a dedication. A golden flag is prominently displayed against one wall. Mounted above the grand oak door is a leather banner that has "Walk in Honor" branded into it. A Saldaean crafted, walnut weapons case stands in the corner of the room. Various Leuian symbols are hammered into the moonsilver panels adorning the case's doors. A highly polished, maple pantry sits next to the weapons case and bears the mark of the Leuian warrior on each of it's doors.

From the door, the hard-packed floor descends to a blazing fire pit with aromatic woods such as apple wood, orange and juniper. Fragrant braided sweet-grass mats are placed randomly around the fire pit. Horn sconces bearing beeswax candles emit a soft light, which permeates the room. A simple, yet elegant redwood plaque adorns the far wall. Carved into this plaque is a dedication. A golden flag is prominently displayed against one wall. Mounted above the grand oak door is a leather banner that has "Walk in Honor" branded into it. A Saldaean crafted, walnut weapons case stands in the corner of the room. Various Leuian symbols are hammered into the moonsilver panels adorning the case's doors.

Plush, green grass covers the ground. A small babbling brook rises suddenly from the ground then runs through the clearing flowing over smooth stones creating a miniature waterfall which then drains back into the earth. A large garden with rows of vegetables is surrounded by a radiant flowerbed bursting in a riot of colors. Claw footed oak benches are sporadically placed around the garden and brook. Large trees, as tall as the surrounding building, create a canopy for the clearing allowing small rays of sun, as well as, tiny portals to view the twinkling stars with a stunning view of Rinanni's Circle of Promise. On each side of the garden, almost hidden by the dense foliage of the trees, are two grand deep mahogany tufted leather doors etched with the Pride's symbol.  A babbling brook, a small granite cenotaph, a rhododendron bush, an open star embossed leather door, and an open claw marked leather door are here.

A grove of young, green-needled pine trees surrounds a small meadow of vibrantly flowering rhododendrons. Hues of bright pink, red, and white create a stunning contrast against the darker grey bark of the pines. Brighter green hemlock trees spread to catch the sunlight, which, in turn, shelter smaller stands of delicious salmonberry bushes, airy leather ferns, and poignantly fragranced sorrels that thrive on the compost of the forest floor. Soft haircap moss covers the river stone-lined path, dew from the mist collecting on it like pollen on bees. The distant wash of rushing water quietly filters through the peaceful air that hangs heavily saturated with moisture.  A stack of rocks is here.

What was once a very well used trade route has slowed to some caravans bringing supplies for the townsmen and the occasional merchants traveling from the far southern reaches of the land. Many guards protect this section of the fort as it is home to some wild beasts that live outside these walls.

Large stones and logs have been stacked and piled, while some workers tirelessly attempt to repair the damage that occurred here during the Lords of Chaos wars. The buildings and homes of the people that resided here are slowly taking shape, though, far from completed. The smell of dyes, used to paint the town, permeate the area.

The grass rises taller and taller in every direction further limiting view just off the roadside. A second glance reveals that this is the lowest point in a large, shallow depression. The tradeway sinks a little lower as it gets closer to the river off to the west. A ditch runs alongside the river's side of the road, small puddles of water filling the bottom. Trickles filter into the puddles from the grass beyond as mosquitoes dart across the muddy surfaces.

Only the well-built, stone tradeway gives any hint of civilization ever having had any presence here. The tall grasses limit visibility nearby, hiding any wildlife that may be waiting for prey to stumble too close. A few blades of grass sway slightly in the breeze, some of them broken by the passing of something heavy over them. One of the larger stones in the road, broken loose from its mortar, waits patiently to be repaired.

The stone paved tradeway stretches across the open plains, interrupting nature's task of consuming the land. An endless sea of grass surrounds you, lapping at the road much like the tides against a beach. The faintly damp wind occasionally blowing in from the west smells of earth. Some of the stones in the road interlock together to form the crude image of a lion. There is no discerning if it was done on purpose or sheer accident.

[Southern Tradeway.]

The tradeway runs across the open grasslands northeast towards the Spur, and southwest towards distant lands and eventually, the coast. The plains to the south and east seem totally indifferent to your existence. Just ahead, a small path moves up a village of huts spread out in a semi-circle. In the center of the village a giant fire pit sits where barbarians who wander through the village can sit around to stay warm.  A worn grassy path is here.

[Wilderness gate.]

Set within a wide tunnel leading through the hedge to the north is the Wilderness Gate. It separates the settled lands of Spur from the open plains to the south of the city. The plains stretch as far as the eyes can see, the horizon and the walls of the fort down the road the only blemishes of the grassy landscape in the distance. The stones of the road are smoothly set together, well built to withstand heavy travel. A broken wagon wheel, discarded some time ago, covers a spot of nearby grass, weeds trying to climb through the spokes.  An open bronze gate is here.

This narrow tunnel through the hedge leads up to the gateway that lets out to the wilderness beyond. Though it used to see heavy traffic from the south, the docks have made this gate largely a place of semi-banishment for the guards.  An open bronze gate is here.

Golden and green stalks of corn sway slowly with the wind, filling the air with the soft whisper of their movement. Small patches of dirt, grass, and pebbles lead straight, narrow paths through the towering maze of corn. Each row is thick and heavy with luscious stalks of golden corn. To the west, blackened soot and ashes frame the outline of a razed field. The rickety old fence creaks open and closed as the wind becomes more strident.  An open iron gate and a brightly painted warning are here.

The old wooden fence bends sharply forming borders for the northwest corner of the cornfield. Looking beyond the fence, rolling plains stretch out as far as the eye can see. However, a blackened field, lying directly beside the cornfield, tarnishes the rolling green landscape. Smoke wafts from the smoldering grasses, plants, and wood. Some of the charred debris stirs with the wind, blackening the old fence with ash-covered patches.  Some charred weeds and twigs, an iron pitchfork, some silver coins, a large dull iron spade, a closed layered burlap sack, a brittle old iron shovel, a closed beautiful silver coffer, an iron pitchfork, a closed weathered buckskin bag, an iron pitchfork, and a closed handmade brass coffer are here.

Cluttered with pebbles and rocks, the ground slopes down into a shallow depression where a larger animal has burrowed a hole into the path. The towering stalks bend with the wind as if a hand pushes them down forcefully. The corn's heavy weight causes some of the stalks to hang over the fence, leaving gaps between the rows. A faceless scarecrow, standing still and lifeless on a stake, peeks out from behind the corn.

Perfectly straight and well-kept rows of corn tower above, creating a living maze. The dusty path whittles itself between the tall cornstalks and a wooden fence.

Small stacks of golden hay sit in the field, being prepared for the winter months.  Some dry corncobs are here.

[Corn Field.]

Perfectly straight and well-kept rows of corn tower above, creating a living maze. The dusty path whittles itself between the tall cornstalks and a wooden fence. Just beyond the rickety old fence to the east, brown and white cows graze a vibrant green field. They move slowly across the landscape of hills and pasture. Small stacks of golden hay sit in the field, being prepared for the winter months.  Some dry corncobs are here.

This area is illuminated.
You see the 1st scarecrow, the 2nd scarecrow, the 3rd scarecrow, and the 4th scarecrow.
In the area is Tarum the Human.
Obvious paths: east* west*.

>[Corn Field.]

Perfectly straight and well-kept rows of corn tower above, creating a living maze. The dusty path whittles itself between the tall cornstalks and a wooden fence. Just beyond the rickety old fence to the east, brown and white cows graze a vibrant green field. They move slowly across the landscape of hills and pasture. Small stacks of golden hay sit in the field, being prepared for the winter months.  Some dry corncobs are here.

This area is illuminated.
You see the 1st scarecrow, the 2nd scarecrow, the 3rd scarecrow, and the 4th scarecrow.
In the area is Tarum the Human.
Obvious paths: east* west*.

[Corn Field.]

Perfectly straight and well-kept rows of corn tower above, creating a living maze. The dusty path whittles itself between the tall cornstalks and a wooden fence. Just beyond the rickety old fence to the east, brown and white cows graze a vibrant green field. They move slowly across the landscape of hills and pasture. Small stacks of golden hay sit in the field, being prepared for the winter months.  Some dry corncobs are here.

This area is illuminated.
You see the 1st scarecrow, the 2nd scarecrow, the 3rd scarecrow, the 4th scarecrow, and the 5th scarecrow.
Obvious paths: east* west*.

Perfectly straight and well-kept rows of corn tower above, creating a living maze. The dusty path whittles itself between the tall cornstalks and a wooden fence. Just beyond the rickety old fence to the east, brown and white cows graze a vibrant green field. They move slowly across the landscape of hills and pasture. Small stacks of golden hay sit in the field, being prepared for the winter months.  Some dry corncobs are here.

This area is illuminated.
You see the 1st scarecrow, the 2nd scarecrow, the 3rd scarecrow, the 4th scarecrow, the 5th scarecrow, and the 6th scarecrow.
Obvious paths: east* west*.

>[Corn Field.]

Perfectly straight and well-kept rows of corn tower above, creating a living maze. The dusty path whittles itself between the tall cornstalks and a wooden fence. Just beyond the rickety old fence to the east, brown and white cows graze a vibrant green field. They move slowly across the landscape of hills and pasture. Small stacks of golden hay sit in the field, being prepared for the winter months.  Some dry corncobs are here.

This area is illuminated.
You see the 1st scarecrow, the 2nd scarecrow, the 3rd scarecrow, the 4th scarecrow, the 5th scarecrow, and the 6th scarecrow.

>[Corn Field.]

Cluttered with pebbles and rocks, the ground slopes down into a shallow depression where a larger animal has burrowed a hole into the path. The towering stalks bend with the wind as if a hand pushes them down forcefully. The corn's heavy weight causes some of the stalks to hang over the fence, leaving gaps between the rows. A faceless scarecrow, standing still and lifeless on a stake, peeks out from behind the corn.

This area is illuminated.
You see the 1st raven.

[Corn Field.]

A large pile of bleached cow bones are stacked high against the outside fence. On the top of the bones, sits a cow skull with a menacing gaze, explaining why the cows give such a large berth to the fence and cornfield. A garden snake slithers slowly in and out of the skeletal cow's eye orbital cavities. Tall weeds grow wildly at the corner of the cornfield, entwining themselves around the aged wood. This is the only area of the cornfield that is not well groomed.

Cluttered with pebbles and rocks, the ground slopes down into a shallow depression where a larger animal has burrowed a hole into the path. The towering stalks bend with the wind as if a hand pushes them down forcefully. The corn's heavy weight causes some of the stalks to hang over the fence, leaving gaps between the rows. A faceless scarecrow, standing still and lifeless on a stake, peeks out from behind the corn.

Golden and green stalks of corn sway slowly with the wind, filling the air with the soft whisper of their movement. Small patches of dirt, grass, and pebbles lead straight, narrow paths through the towering maze of corn. Each row is thick and heavy with luscious stalks of golden corn. To the west, blackened soot and ashes frame the outline of a razed field. The rickety old fence creaks open and closed as the wind becomes more strident.

The old wooden fence bends sharply forming borders for the northwest corner of the cornfield. Looking beyond the fence, rolling plains stretch out as far as the eye can see. However, a blackened field, lying directly beside the cornfield, tarnishes the rolling green landscape. Smoke wafts from the smoldering grasses, plants, and wood. Some of the charred debris stirs with the wind, blackening the old fence with ash-covered patches.  Some charred weeds and twigs are here.

Pitchforks, shovels, and other implements are stacked up neatly against the fence here. Imprints where some tools would have been before are sunk into the earth. A blood soaked rag is tied around the fence and wafts softly like a pennant catches flight with a breeze. The sweet smell of corn carries on the wind.  Its aroma is inviting, yet there are so few animals drawn to it.  A shovel and a hoe are here.

Perfectly straight and well-kept rows of corn tower above, creating a living maze. The dusty path whittles itself between the tall cornstalks and a wooden fence. Just beyond the rickety old fence to the east, brown and white cows graze a vibrant green field. They move slowly across the landscape of hills and pasture. Small stacks of golden hay sit in the field, being prepared for the winter months.  Some dry corncobs are here.

Pitchforks, shovels, and other implements are stacked up neatly against the fence here. Imprints where some tools would have been before are sunk into the earth. A blood soaked rag is tied around the fence and wafts softly like a pennant catches flight with a breeze. The sweet smell of corn carries on the wind.  Its aroma is inviting, yet there are so few animals drawn to it.  A shovel and a hoe are here.

Beyond the razed field, beautiful birds flutter and sore over the green field. Strange that there are not many birds in the cornfield. The top beam of the old fence has been broken into two parts. A tuft of fur is tangled in the splintered timber. It is also heavily soiled by blood as if the creature was wounded before it fled. Heavy footprints lead a trail across the razed field. From the depth and length of the footprints, the animal moved with quick precise movements until it reached the edge of the field, where its carcass now rots.

The wind howls through the deep maze of corn, carrying strange clicking and snapping noises from inside the cornstalks. A glint of white in the soil shimmers softly as it catches the passing light. A closer look reveals that is a skeletal hand, reaching out from under the dirt. Some slimy brown worms slither down its fingers, before burrowing themselves into the fertile earth. A blood stained scythe rests in the cusp of the corner fence.

[Corn Field.]

Dark flashes of auburn dart from the woods and streak past the cornfield. The deer nonchalantly throw a glance at the field then quickly continue on their way. The corn that hovers over the fence bears the mark of their nibbling. Straw is strewn across the pathway. Some if it is thrown in a large heap on the ground outside the fence, and a pair of pants and a shirt rests in the golden hay. From inside the fence, it looks like a person who toppled over.  Some dry corncobs are here.

The wind howls through the deep maze of corn, carrying strange clicking and snapping noises from inside the cornstalks. A glint of white in the soil shimmers softly as it catches the passing light. A closer look reveals that is a skeletal hand, reaching out from under the dirt. Some slimy brown worms slither down its fingers, before burrowing themselves into the fertile earth. A blood stained scythe rests in the cusp of the corner fence.

Beyond the razed field, beautiful birds flutter and sore over the green field. Strange that there are not many birds in the cornfield. The top beam of the old fence has been broken into two parts. A tuft of fur is tangled in the splintered timber. It is also heavily soiled by blood as if the creature was wounded before it fled. Heavy footprints lead a trail across the razed field. From the depth and length of the footprints, the animal moved with quick precise movements until it reached the edge of the field, where its carcass now rots.

[Corn Field.]

Pitchforks, shovels, and other implements are stacked up neatly against the fence here. Imprints where some tools would have been before are sunk into the earth. A blood soaked rag is tied around the fence and wafts softly like a pennant catches flight with a breeze. The sweet smell of corn carries on the wind.  Its aroma is inviting, yet there are so few animals drawn to it.  A shovel and a hoe are here.

[Corn Field.]

The old wooden fence bends sharply forming borders for the northwest corner of the cornfield. Looking beyond the fence, rolling plains stretch out as far as the eye can see. However, a blackened field, lying directly beside the cornfield, tarnishes the rolling green landscape. Smoke wafts from the smoldering grasses, plants, and wood. Some of the charred debris stirs with the wind, blackening the old fence with ash-covered patches.  Some charred weeds and twigs are here.

Golden and green stalks of corn sway slowly with the wind, filling the air with the soft whisper of their movement. Small patches of dirt, grass, and pebbles lead straight, narrow paths through the towering maze of corn. Each row is thick and heavy with luscious stalks of golden corn. To the west, blackened soot and ashes frame the outline of a razed field. The rickety old fence creaks open and closed as the wind becomes more strident.  An open iron gate and a brightly painted warning are here.

A few scraggly trees are the forerunners of the large forest barely coming into view on the horizon.  A picketed fence to the south of you marks the end of the corn field that you had been passing.  An open iron gate and a crushed bloated merchant's corpse are here.

Even though it shows heavy wear, the road is in remarkably good repair. It was built by expert craftsmen to withstand the rigors of time and use. Evidence of recent repairs indicate that any problems are dealt with quickly and competently.  A broken old wooden trash wagon is here.

Through the gate lies the city of Spur, the major center of trade and civilization on the plains. The dusty road leading through the gates is well traveled, and walls of the city are in good repair. A small shack sits to the west of the road, during most times of the day a dusty coach can be seen waiting in front, its horses stomping with impatience to be gone. To the right of the door is a small window, its opening covered with metal bars. An old man, missing most of his teeth, waits patiently for the travelers to pay their fare, and then directs them into the waiting area. On the east side of the road a billowing multicolored tent has been erected, the hustle and bustle of merchants and customers can be seen coming and going at all times of the day.  A rainbow silk tent, an open iron gate, and a fluffy white layer of snow are here.
