[Town Square Center.]

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.  A marble statue of a Human, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a rosewood sign, a crisp gold lettered vellum notice, a flowing purple marble fountain, a shimmering purple marble statue of an Ice Demon, a small blackened pile of ashes, a short iron dirk, and some silver coins are here.

Torrana, lost in her thoughts, just entered from the west.

Linus asks Crax, "You say you protect the weak, but would not letting such a crazed madman wander about be letting it attack some innocent later?"

Torrana's head suddenly begins glowing. She places a hand upon her chest. The glow travels down an arm to her hand. The glow quickly spreads over Torrana's entire body, then fades away.


Symphany smiles at Torrana.

Torrana smiles at Symphany and hugs him lightly.

September says, "My great grandfather taught me to turn the other cheek, I am sure it it were a much more powerful foe then the young ones would not have attacked"

Crax says, "wasn't fully healed"

Linus says to Crax, "Obviously not, it came in trying to attack, perhaps out of desperation, perhaps not. In any case, if you had forced it to leave, it would have been by magical means, not lasting ones.."

Crax mutters something beneath his breath.

September says to Linus, "or defending against Etheri as I did and leaving the area"

The speckled woodland owl glares.

Dathis says to Crax in Leuian, "Ya did ya best. No one can ask for more. "

Amaya just entered from the north.

Amaya just went west.

Etheri shrugs.

The traffic on the northern street heading away from town square is an eclectic bunch.  Those who belong to the guilds to the north travel in packs on their way to and from guild events.  It is not unusual to see a group of armored fighters passing a group of robed clerics, each heading in the opposite direction. The large temple of Rinanni rises to the north, its white marble almost glowing in the light.  A street lantern and a fluffy white layer of snow are here.

Beds of wildflowers line the carefully placed cobblestones along this street. A pair of love birds, cooing in delight, sit upon a white marble bench. The giggles and laughs of a pair of trysting lovers echoes from the room in the Traveler's Hostel to the east. It is certain that Rinanni looks down upon this scene with delight.  A white marble bench and a street lantern are here.

A peaceful bliss pervades the very core of this guilded path. Below a large oak tree a couple of Rinannian priestesses sing lightly in Secti. Several merchants pause to listen to the song. Even a few hardened warriors cannot help but smile at the sweet melody.  A large oak tree, an open dragon-etched emerald door, and a street lantern are here.

The 2nd drunk bar patron stumbles about drunkenly.

The distant glimmer from a temple made of white marble and pearl catches your eye. An intricate gilded iron gate and a small winding path are all that separate you from the dazzling temple of Rinanni. Majestic marble statues of doves in flight stand on either side of the gate. The gaze of their peaceful eyes seems to follow your every movement.  An open intricately gilded iron gate, a pair of pure white marble dove statues, and a street lantern are here.

A large stone building rises just to the east of Northern Avenue. These barracks house those known as Dread Knights. It is not unusual to see patrols of this elite group heading down the street towards Town Square. One would hope their presence would allow everyone to live in peace. If only they would stop fingering their swords all the time, you might believe it yourself.  A street lantern is here.

Northern Avenue ends at a gateway set within the massive city walls. On the other side of the gate are the Guild Halls. Those who pass through accept the bond of peace that the Guilds impose on all who desire their services. On either side of the gate guards stand at attention saluting all those who pass by.  An open iron gate, an open thick stone door, and a street lantern are here.

The city walls tower high above you at the entrance to the guild district. On top of the wall, a very bored looking guard with a lazy eye watches those passing through the gate. The large guild buildings spread out around the district, bustling with the day-to-day activity of the city's guild groups.  An open iron gate and a street lantern are here.

The massive building of the Merchant's Guild looms over a vast part of the guild district. The activity at the main door of the guild is mind numbing as hundreds of citizens and merchants alike rush in and out of the guild to handle their business. While the governor has control over the city guard, many claim it is the Merchant's Guild that runs the city of Spur.  An open exquisite polished mahogany door and a street lantern are here.

To the south the road runs back into the center of the city, further to the north the city road continues on toward the other guilds. All the legal city guilds are represented within this city district except for the Forester's Guild. A sign stands beside the road to help direct lost would-be foresters to their guild hall.

Numerous citizens walk purposefully along the busy street. Fighters and mercenaries make up the majority, but some from almost all walks of life hurry past as well.

The sounds of clashing steel and the calls of battle fill the air near the entrance to the Mercenary's Guild. Numerous hardened warriors lean up against the walls of the building waiting for job offers, while others move in and out of the guild hall going about their daily business. By the looks of it, some of the veterans are giving a barbarian near the front door a hard time.  An open white cedar door and a street lantern are here.

A narrow steel gate leads through a short white stone wall. Beyond the gate lies the practice yard for the Mercenary's Guild. Novice mercenaries sit or stand outside the gate, either resting from their exertions or gathering their courage to enter. Piles of old bandages lie beside the road. Behind the practice yard, the incredible outer wall stands high above the city.  An open polished oak door, a street lantern, and an open shattered grey steel gate are here.

The tangy-sweet smell of metal and leather permeate the air of this shop. A stout Hithual wearing a leather apron barks an order to a young apprentice who lets out a yelp and rushes to the back of the shop to carry out his master's wishes. The shopkeeper mumbles about lazy youngsters and returns to oiling a fine looking leather weapon harness, leaving you to examine his wares on your own.   Some glowing quartz faced copper lanterns and an open polished oak door are here.
