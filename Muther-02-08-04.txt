A small shaft of light catches your eye. It appears someone has thrown a rope up to a small landing, and from the looks of it just narrowly missed being crushed by a cave in. Looks like his friend was not so lucky. A small crack has opened up in the cave wall, and the smell of must wafts from it.  A tattered rope, some boulders, and a rotting corpse are here.

The stone walls swallow the golden light as darkness drapes the tunnel in a black veil.

Tendrils of ruby climb up the dark stone walls, forming an arch below a large orifice that resembles a gaping mouth with fangs.

Following the flickering yellow light, the ceiling slants upwards from the cave into a spacious opening.

Dissolved out of limestone by acidic water, the cave opens into a vast cavern. The walls are constantly wet from flowing water and have resulted in cauliflower formations. An astounding variety of glistening  icicle shaped stalactites and stalagmites have slowly formed by minerals in the water slowly building up. Under one of the largest stalactites, a cave pool has receded in this area leaving large mushroom shaped bell canopies.

Blowing wind carrying abrasive particles has eroded the walls in this tall, canyon-like passage. A colony of small cave dwelling bats roost in dense clusters upon the ceiling. A single bat breaks free from the group darting back and forth. Eventually, the rest tumble into the sky tumultuously bounding all around. The group becomes a swirling tornado of beating wings as the bats engulf the cavern. Suddenly, the outburst starts to disintegrate as groups of bats break off to roosts again.

The slow drip of water has carved a shallow bowl-like groove into the floor over the years.

Sulfurous clouds of mist rise, without any noticeable pattern, from a crack in the floor. They stain the grayish rock with a yellowish tinge. The smell is acrid and offending.

Growing at an odd angle, and sticking out from about eight inches of water, is a colorless plant. The only thing to identify it as plant life are a couple anemic looking leaves. It is as if anything in this deep dark cavern has the life sucked out of it. Even something as strong as this little plant shows the ravages of time and the strength it takes to survive.

Deep enough that a Thugian would have to wade carefully, the water in this portion of the tunnel laps high on the walls. Drips can be heard, and occasionally pelt those traversing the tunnel on the head, or down the back of their necks. Odd looking fish dart in and out amongst unidentifiable items beneath the surface. It may be best to not try to hard to figure out what the items are.

Almost completely underwater the depths of this tunnel have been reached. Darting amongst those brave enough to swim through are small iridescent blue fish, their bodies pulse with an eerie blue light. In the dark of the cave, the light they produce is enough to allow most to see their surroundings. Veins of silver line the ceiling, those competent enough to not drown are able to reach out and touch them if they so wish.

Lapping at the muddy sides, water rises half way up the tunnel walls. Cold water mixes with stringy moss, and objects that remain unidentifiable. Small fish can be seen darting through the water, their skin glowing a light blue. Whether they glow from some unseen ambient light, or just a natural mutation of nature is unknown. Only those lucky enough to fly above the water remain dry.

The sound of dripping water echoes through the darkened tunnel. The smell of moisture and the feeling of dampness invades the surrounding area.

Minute streams of water seep through slender fractures in the limestone walls. From the constant trickle of water, feathery designs, like lavish drapes, are worn into the light gray surroundings.

A mysterious glow can be seen to the north. The smell of burning wood permeates the immediate area. Tucked against the wall of tunnel are the remnants of a rather large camp fire. Every so often a small drop of water leaches out from the rocks above and drips on the old ash, wafting the smell of campfire through the cavern.  A dusty camp fire is here.

This portion of the passage way opens up to a large circular room. The stunning aspect of the room is the three-hundred sixty degree mural drawn on the smooth walls.  The rock ceiling is painted a vibrant hue of blue, the floor a lush verdant green. The scene on the walls depicts a large open area, with dirt roads leading off in eight different directions. A careful look at the mural reveals you are standing in a faux Town square of Spur, only in the city on the wall there is not a building to be seen. The fact this must have been drawn a long time ago becomes readily apparent.

A gradual rise in the tunnel changes the appearance of the walls. The mix of dirt and stone gives way to soft dirt. A few pieces of old wood, that resemble tree trunks more then wooded slats, attempt to hold back soft walls. They are not doing a very good job, as small rivulets of dirt puddle on the packed earthen floor.

Steps have been dug into the soft earthen floor of this dark cave. Either descending into the darkness or rising to the top of the tunnel, someone long ago decided the going was too difficult and attempted to make it simpler.

A steep sloping tunnel heads south into the depths of darkness. A small slice of light seeps through a crevasse at the top of this cavern. Shrill screams and deep moans resonate from the fissure, echoing off the empty walls. While this tunnel appears to have been here many years, the fact those trying to escape from the jail missed it by such a slim margin is just bad luck.  A long thin crack is here.

[Noble Way.]

The occasional locked gate marks the entrance to some of the more hidden estates of Spurs nobility. From this broad avenue, little can be seen of their splendor. Behind the imposing gate recedes a proud drive, disappearing mysteriously into the trees. If not for the large imposing tower rising above the hedges it would be hard to discern anything was beyond the gate. It is apparent the residents do not wish to be disturbed.  A street lantern, a closed morbius door, and an open black iron gate are here.

Majestic elms continue to line this broad roadway, sheltering the avenue on both sides and further enhancing the grandiose atmosphere. Fronting the beautiful homes, cobbled paths edged with narrow flower beds meander through nearby private gardens. Though they appear wonderful places to spend an afternoon or take a picnic, the glances from those tending the estates makes it clear they are only for the invited.  A street lantern is here.

A small roadway bordered by flowering hedges bisects the wide avenue of Noble Way at a right angle, heading east to west.  A thick, sturdy sign stands just off to the side of a charming path, its large friendly letters intent on luring travelers into the city's premiere roadstay, the Gilded Lion Inn. The entrance is clearly marked and welcoming, extending off to the southeast.  A wooden sign and a street lantern are here.

Occasional gates and driveways lead back into the well-kept estates of the city's nobility, breaking and adding interest to the defining plane of the walls lining Noble Way.

Numerous trees lining the avenue serve as the dividing border between the majestic estates of the nobility and the lightly traveled roadway.

However, they are no easier to access, still protected by their own guarding walls, some covered with ivy or colorful blooming vines.  A street lantern is here.

The entire avenue is composed of fine cobblestone, each level with its neighbor, providing a smooth ride for passing carriages and horses.

Leaving the exceptionally wealthy estates of the Spurian nobility, Noble Way heads toward the Town Square to the northwest. Along the roadside can be seen the in-city homes of successful merchants and other wealthy citizens of the Spur. The homes display a slightly different style, perhaps they are not quite so restrained; a touch more exuberance and freedom with materials is displayed.  A street lantern is here.

Gazing down each of the nearby private drives reveals a glimpse of a luxurious home, each a miniature estate in its own right.

Noble Way continues to wind its way among the rather modestly sized, but elegant, homes of the Spur's successful. Many a peasant farmer may live in homes larger than these, but none can match the quality found here. A peaceful, luxurious feeling pervades this part of town; perhaps it is the drifting floral scents wafting from the well-tended gardens.

They are here to assist all who pass with the simple kindness of opening a gate, or the more important task of escorting those in need to the bank or market.

The boughs of a large apple tree hang over the well tended avenue. Below the beautiful tree stands a small fountain. Atop the fountain is an intricately carved Secian who appears to be dancing with the water as it splashes around her. Set in the marble base is a small plaque that reads, "For those who have gone before us." Many stand for a moment as they pass this way, giving thanks for the gift of life that is given by both the apple tree and the Secians of long ago. Large piles of dirt and broken stone lay on either side of the street as workmen ready the east and west alleys for expansion.  A street lantern, a Secian etched moonsilver door, a pair of open silver forged swinging doors, and a sign above the doors are here.

Vast estates tower over the huge Spurian wall towards the south. The well-to-do who live in these homes idle away their days, enjoying the luxury of time. Standing next to a very empty lantern pole, a small Flerian child insists in a plaintive wail, that he had nothing to do with the missing lantern. The well-dressed guard that interrogates him keeps pointing at a small sack on the ground and its obvious contents.  An open small burlap sack and a street lantern are here.

The outward appearance of the people here seems a bit classier. Rich clothing and large coin purses are prevalent amongst the travelers. In fact, many of the folk heading into Town Square from the south are accompanied by large bodyguards to assure their safety. The well maintained road is lined with small brass lanterns, each swinging off an individual pole. No expense has been spared to keep those who travel this road safe from the hoodlums that relish the darkness.  A street lantern and some charred foliage are here.

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.   A flowing white marble fountain, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a cracked marble statue of a Human, a carved marble statue of a Dragon, a rosewood sign, a small jagged cobblestone crack, a welcome mat, and a spent marshmallow on a stick are here.

The traffic on the northern street heading away from town square is an eclectic bunch.  Those who belong to the guilds to the north travel in packs on their way to and from guild events.

Behind a tall counter a well-dressed female with a short beard takes new orders and scurries to retrieve items for pickup. Behind her, industrious Hithuals work at several forges, filling the stout building with noise and smoke. Specializing in the repairing of old damaged equipment for adventurers, their services are in high demand. Their quality and quick turn over has earned them enough coin to garner one of the prime locations in the Spur.  A giant iron anvil, a wooden sign, and a heavy mahogany door are here.

[Town Square.]

Two elegant buildings, one to the north and one to the west, stand on either side of a quickly degrading road. Nattily dressed patrons of the two establishments hurry to their destination, not pausing for fear of being robbed, or worse. To the northwest the houses steadily become more decrepit. A dark pallor of smoky air hangs heavily over the area.  A street lantern and a heavy mahogany door are here.

[Low Street.]

A darkly clad hoodlum leans against a worn street sign. He eyes those who pass by very carefully and then makes a few gestures into the shadows. All who are forced to travel upon this road have learned to keep one hand on their coin purse, the other on their weapon, and their wits about them.  A faded wooden sign and a glowing street lantern are here.

[Town Square Center.]

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.   A flowing white marble fountain, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a cracked marble statue of a Human, a carved marble statue of a Dragon, a rosewood sign, a small jagged cobblestone crack, a welcome mat, and a spent marshmallow on a stick are here.

In the area are Quento the Drag-al, Haberthan the Hithual, Noffbrau the Noble Hithual, Quazzy the Leuian, Phannah the Noble Human (holding a glowing yellow and black glass bumble bee), Lorkhit the Leuian, and Kayin the Human.

You have entered the somber insurance headquarters of the House of the Dead. Richly appointed furnishings indicate that these services are refused by few. An elegant sign over a massive desk details available services. The presence of some inexplicable power sets your nerves on end. This is no place for hostility.

[Trade Way & Bazaar Path.]

A path to the north winds its way among various stalls and tents. Some specialty outlets can be found, provided one does not get lost in this maze known as the Bazaar. More permanent structures to the south suggest finer goods as well as increased security.  A street lantern is here.

[Trade Way.]

This well-worn road separates the Bazaar to the north and Market Circle to the south. Only a Thugian could appreciate the layered odors of simmering foodstuffs and shoppers from the Bazaar. Crowds of people push past, some brushing against you. It might be a good idea to keep an eye on your coinpurse.  A street lantern is here.

[Trade & Market.]

The buildings of Market Circle stand to the south. It becomes obvious that the area through the arch is a much cleaner marketplace than the bazaar. An inviting eatery stands beside the road, its door open to those weary after a long trip to Spur, as well as those preparing to venture to the great expanses beyond the west gate. A human couple exit the building, arm in arm. A small sign stands beside the intersection.  A sign, an open glossy lacquered mahogany door, and a street lantern are here.

Situated between the well-traveled Trade Way to the north and the fine shops of Market Circle to the south, this small stretch of road is busy at all times of day.

A new building has been erected on this side street. It is sturdily constructed from wood and brick, and bears a sign reading, "Symher's Trading Post." Various objects line the window display ranging from weapons and armor to random objects you've never seen before. Insistent bartering goes on at all hours.

Symher the Usil Trader sits in a corner with a small lamp cataloging and appraising the various items he has deemed fit to buy.  The cluttered shelves are piled so high it's a wonder he can keep track.  You carefully make your way through the armor, weapons and assorted sundries, to the counter.
