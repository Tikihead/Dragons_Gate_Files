A narrow steel gate leads through a short white stone wall. Beyond the gate lies the practice yard for the Mercenary's Guild. Novice mercenaries sit or stand outside the gate, either resting from their exertions or gathering their courage to enter. Piles of old bandages lie beside the road. Behind the practice yard, the incredible outer wall stands high above the city.  An open polished oak door, a street lantern, and an open shattered grey steel gate are here.

The sounds of clashing steel and the calls of battle fill the air near the entrance to the Mercenary's Guild. Numerous hardened warriors lean up against the walls of the building waiting for job offers, while others move in and out of the guild hall going about their daily business. By the looks of it, some of the veterans are giving a barbarian near the front door a hard time.  An open white cedar door and a street lantern are here.

Northern Avenue meets Art Avenue at this intersection. Further to the north, the Mercenary's Guild makes its home, while the Bard's and Sage's Guilds are to the east. The extravagant Merchant's Guild stands to the south. Various sponsors wave pieces of parchment in an attempt to recruit new members.

To the south the road runs back into the center of the city, further to the north the city road continues on toward the other guilds. All the legal city guilds are represented within this city district except for the Forester's Guild. A sign stands beside the road to help direct lost would-be foresters to their guild hall.  A beautiful etched wooden sign and a street lantern are here.

The massive building of the Merchant's Guild looms over a vast part of the guild district. The activity at the main door of the guild is mind numbing as hundreds of citizens and merchants alike rush in and out of the guild to handle their business. While the governor has control over the city guard, many claim it is the Merchant's Guild that runs the city of Spur.  An open exquisite polished mahogany door and a street lantern are here.

Northern Avenue ends at a gateway set within the massive city walls. On the other side of the gate are the Guild Halls. Those who pass through accept the bond of peace that the Guilds impose on all who desire their services. On either side of the gate guards stand at attention saluting all those who pass by.

A large stone building rises just to the east of Northern Avenue. These barracks house those known as Dread Knights. It is not unusual to see patrols of this elite group heading down the street towards Town Square. One would hope their presence would allow everyone to live in peace. If only they would stop fingering their swords all the time, you might believe it yourself.  A street lantern is here.

The distant glimmer from a temple made of white marble and pearl catches your eye. An intricate gilded iron gate and a small winding path are all that separate you from the dazzling temple of Rinanni. Majestic marble statues of doves in flight stand on either side of the gate. The gaze of their peaceful eyes seems to follow your every movement.  An open intricately gilded iron gate, a pair of pure white marble dove statues, and a street lantern are here.

A peaceful bliss pervades the very core of this guilded path. Below a large oak tree a couple of Rinannian priestesses sing lightly in Secti. Several merchants pause to listen to the song.

Beds of wildflowers line the carefully placed cobblestones along this street. A pair of love birds, cooing in delight, sit upon a white marble bench.

The traffic on the northern street heading away from town square is an eclectic bunch.  Those who belong to the guilds to the north travel in packs on their way to and from guild events.  It is not unusual to see a group of armored fighters passing a group of robed clerics, each heading in the opposite direction. The large temple of Rinanni rises to the north, its white marble almost glowing in the light.  A street lantern and a fluffy white layer of snow are here.

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.  A marble statue of a Human, a shimmering marble statue of a Dragon, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a rosewood sign, a crisp gold lettered vellum notice, a fluffy white layer of snow, a pile of sparkling snow balls, and a flowing white marble fountain are here.

Travel to the eastern portion of Town Square finds battle clad warriors shoulder to shoulder with chained criminals and those who live outside the Spurian Walls. The cobblestones that line the street are stained with blood.  It is unknown as to whether the blood is from guards carrying out quick executions, or gladiators who refused to wait their turn for arena space.  A street lantern and a fluffy white layer of snow are here.

People hurry on their way along the eastern road both into and out of Spur. A black clad woman holding the hands of two small children slowly walks towards the east, facing the somber task of burial. Two armored warriors, carrying tankards, are in high spirits as they head back to Town Square to share the story of their day in the arena.  A street lantern is here.

A small rivulet of blood flows down the path that leads from the north and meets up with Condemned Walk. At the end of the path lies Execution Square and its viewing stands. It is at this point that the sentenced criminals discover their fate. Many hope to battle for their lives in the arena, but for most, the sentence is execution by one of the Spurian Justices.

Those who use Condemned Walk as a thoroughfare find themselves amongst an interesting group of travelers. Those returning from burying their dead and those from the dilapidated housing beyond the eastern gate mix with warriors and criminals.

It is readily apparent that only the gladiators return, usually with a satisfied smirk on their faces. A large group of guards on top of the large Spurian Wall keeps a careful watch on the downtrodden who travel this way. Their appearance makes them suspect, their lack of strength, natural victims.

Huge, colorful silk banners float proudly in the breeze from the giant stone arch that provides passage to the reopened Spurian Arena. The gladiators that once sat dejected and forlorn against the arch now stand proudly and alert, polishing their swords to the highest sheen, and adjusting their helms and breastplates. A long line of potential competitors and audience members alike is beginning to form, the last of whom glance uneasily in the direction of the looming cemetary before turning their attention back on the huge arena ahead.

A large double gate opens on the south side of the road, leading down an old cobbled path. Large wagons, small ox carts, and in some cases old buckboards make the turn toward the cemetery carrying their precious cargo to its final resting place. A large group of darkly-clad San Elves stand just outside the gate, carefully perusing those who pass by. It becomes obvious that those in Taath's Temple will be quickly informed of any insurgent groups heading their direction.  A large double gate is here.

A large, stubborn dog has resolutely planted himself in the middle of the road. His master pulls on the rope around his neck, then pushes his backside firmly. It is quite apparent that nothing short of a nice meaty bone is going to make him budge. Those who travel this path keep their heads lowered and ignore the comical scene. A gnawing hunger and aching muscles after a long day of hard work keep most from paying attention to even the simple things around them.

A small gate stands between Eastern Spur Road and the small, weed infested path that heads north. Through the rusted and worn gate you can make out a few old headstones and crypts, but the vines and overgrown brush obstruct your view. The rumors of evil death-howls and unusual occurrences have the locals hurrying past this location as quickly as possible.  An open black obsidian gate is here.

Uneven cobblestones line the roadway. Worn down by time and heavy traffic, the large potholes have filled with water, debris and unidentifiable muck, and are more prevalent than the stone. Those who travel this way have grown accustomed to the trouble spots, and appear to be dancing to a strange, unheard tune as they bob and weave their way toward their destination.

Uniformed guards patrol high above, conscientiously glancing down to assure peace is being kept along this well-traveled road.

A large, stubborn dog has resolutely planted himself in the middle of the road. His master pulls on the rope around his neck, then pushes his backside firmly. It is quite apparent that nothing short of a nice meaty bone is going to make him budge. Those who travel this path keep their heads lowered and ignore the comical scene. A gnawing hunger and aching muscles after a long day of hard work keep most from paying attention to even the simple things around them.

This room is illuminated.
You see the 1st dirty looking gang member corpse.

A small gate stands between Eastern Spur Road and the small, weed infested path that heads north. Through the rusted and worn gate you can make out a few old headstones and crypts, but the vines and overgrown brush obstruct your view. The rumors of evil death-howls and unusual occurrences have the locals hurrying past this location as quickly as possible.  An open black obsidian gate is here.

This area is illuminated.
You see the 1st brightly clothed gypsy, the 1st loitering bum, and the 1st dirty looking gang member.
Obvious paths: east* west*.

A few brick buildings tower over the rest in the more established part of the Merchant district. An official looking edifice houses the Rasnian Bank, guarded by the city's finest. A few gold-collared pets await their owners inside, sniffing at the ground and each other.  A glowing ornate wrought iron street lantern, an open thick gold-trimmed walnut door, a wooden sign, and an open white snowdrift are here.

The front walls of the building are dominated by glass panels displaying the latest fashions from several of the stores inside.  A pair of women carrying several shopping bags spin through the glass revolving doors while two grumpy looking men drag behind them with even larger bags. A large banner over the revolving doors proudly displays the name, "The Galleria", for all to see.   A street lantern and an open gold trimmed revolving glass door are here.

Guards stand sentry from atop the wall as well as the ground.  A street lantern is here.

Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.  A marble statue of a Human, a shimmering marble statue of a Dragon, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a rosewood sign, a crisp gold lettered vellum notice, a fluffy white layer of snow, a pile of sparkling snow balls, and a flowing white marble fountain are here.

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.  A marble statue of a Human, a shimmering marble statue of a Dragon, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a rosewood sign, a crisp gold lettered vellum notice, a fluffy white layer of snow, a pile of sparkling snow balls, and a flowing white marble fountain are here.

On his forehead is the Mark of Moloch.

On his left calf is a glowing pale green skull with moonsilver eyes.

He appears to be in perfect health.

His gaze greets you with a knowing smirk. A faint green shard of color flickers from within the depths of his dark sapphire eyes as a mysterious countenance befalls his features, masking his intentions.

A large stone building rises just to the east of Northern Avenue. These barracks house those known as Dread Knights. It is not unusual to see patrols of this elite group heading down the street towards Town Square. One would hope their presence would allow everyone to live in peace. If only they would stop fingering their swords all the time, you might believe it yourself.  A street lantern is here.

The distant glimmer from a temple made of white marble and pearl catches your eye. An intricate gilded iron gate and a small winding path are all that separate you from the dazzling temple of Rinanni. Majestic marble statues of doves in flight stand on either side of the gate. The gaze of their peaceful eyes seems to follow your every movement.  An open intricately gilded iron gate, a pair of pure white marble dove statues, and a street lantern are here.

The traffic on the northern street heading away from town square is an eclectic bunch.  Those who belong to the guilds to the north travel in packs on their way to and from guild events.  It is not unusual to see a group of armored fighters passing a group of robed clerics, each heading in the opposite direction. The large temple of Rinanni rises to the north, its white marble almost glowing in the light.  A street lantern and a fluffy white layer of snow are here.

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.  A marble statue of a Human, a shimmering marble statue of a Dragon, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a rosewood sign, a crisp gold lettered vellum notice, a fluffy white layer of snow, a pile of sparkling snow balls, and a flowing white marble fountain are here.

Low Street is the thoroughfare that carries people to the northwestern portion of Spur. The traffic along this road leans towards those without any viable economic means. Women who look older then their years, crippled old men and darkly clad shadowy figures all move stoically towards their destination. Only the plodding of worn shoes breaks the dismal silence.

Potholes and cracks in the road impede travel on this portion of Low Street. Maintenance is not considered a priority, due to the roads distance from the center of the city. Unimpeded by the poor condition of the street, several people gather around a nearby newsstand, reading the latest issue of the Spurian Free Press and discussing politics. Across the street from the newsstand a sign next to a weathered brown wooden door reads, "Spurian Free Press" in large, bold letters.   A street lantern, an open weathered brown wooden door, and a wooden newsstand are here.

A tall stone building, painted a deep sable, rises against the poor quarter wall. Shabbily dressed people enter and exit the building rapidly. Many exit carrying bundles of papers. A faint haze of smoke drifts from the buildings doorway.  A pile of stones and an open wide smoke filled doorway are here.

Many of the other buildings have undergone some refurbishment and are fronted by freshly painted doors and windows. Around the base of the trees that have been planted along the street someone has planted rings of daisies. On the side of the street, a gang of young Thugians taunt a human child, pushing him back and forth. There is neither fear nor anger on the child's face, only dull, apathetic acceptance.

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.  A marble statue of a Human, a shimmering marble statue of a Dragon, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a rosewood sign, a crisp gold lettered vellum notice, a fluffy white layer of snow, a pile of sparkling snow balls, and a flowing white marble fountain are here.

Many of the other buildings have undergone some refurbishment and are fronted by freshly painted doors and windows. Around the base of the trees that have been planted along the street someone has planted rings of daisies. On the side of the street, a gang of young Thugians taunt a human child, pushing him back and forth. There is neither fear nor anger on the child's face, only dull, apathetic acceptance.  An open blue door, a scented lilac tree, a scented lilac tree, and some cheerful yellow and white daisies are here.

The street is immaculately clean save the tons of stones piled along the poor quarter wall. The street stones extend westward, paving the beginnings of a large square shaped area. A tall stone building, painted a deep sable, rises against the poor quarter wall. Shabbily dressed people enter and exit the building rapidly. Many exit carrying bundles of papers. A faint haze of smoke drifts from the buildings doorway.  A pile of stones and an open wide smoke filled doorway are here.

Potholes and cracks in the road impede travel on this portion of Low Street. Maintenance is not considered a priority, due to the roads distance from the center of the city. Unimpeded by the poor condition of the street, several people gather around a nearby newsstand, reading the latest issue of the Spurian Free Press and discussing politics. Across the street from the newsstand a sign next to a weathered brown wooden door reads, "Spurian Free Press" in large, bold letters.   A street lantern, an open weathered brown wooden door, and a wooden newsstand are here.

The traffic on the northern street heading away from town square is an eclectic bunch.  Those who belong to the guilds to the north travel in packs on their way to and from guild events.  It is not unusual to see a group of armored fighters passing a group of robed clerics, each heading in the opposite direction. The large temple of Rinanni rises to the north, its white marble almost glowing in the light.  A street lantern and a fluffy white layer of snow are here.

While the governor has control over the city guard, many claim it is the Merchant's Guild that runs the city of Spur.  An open exquisite polished mahogany door and a street lantern are here.

To the south the road runs back into the center of the city, further to the north the city road continues on toward the other guilds. All the legal city guilds are represented within this city district except for the Forester's Guild. A sign stands beside the road to help direct lost would-be foresters to their guild hall.  A beautiful etched wooden sign and a street lantern are here.

Numerous citizens walk purposefully along the busy street. Fighters and mercenaries make up the majority, but some from almost all walks of life hurry past as well. A dejected street cleaner struggles to keep up with the messes left behind by the pets and other beasts that travel on the roads.  A street lantern is here.

Northern Avenue meets Art Avenue at this intersection. Further to the north, the Mercenary's Guild makes its home, while the Bard's and Sage's Guilds are to the east. The extravagant Merchant's Guild stands to the south. Various sponsors wave pieces of parchment in an attempt to recruit new members.  An open lustrous hammered steel door and a street lantern are here.

The sounds of clashing steel and the calls of battle fill the air near the entrance to the Mercenary's Guild. Numerous hardened warriors lean up against the walls of the building waiting for job offers, while others move in and out of the guild hall going about their daily business. By the looks of it, some of the veterans are giving a barbarian near the front door a hard time.  An open white cedar door and a street lantern are here.

A narrow steel gate leads through a short white stone wall. Beyond the gate lies the practice yard for the Mercenary's Guild. Novice mercenaries sit or stand outside the gate, either resting from their exertions or gathering their courage to enter. Piles of old bandages lie beside the road. Behind the practice yard, the incredible outer wall stands high above the city.  An open polished oak door, a street lantern, and an open shattered grey steel gate are here.

The tangy-sweet smell of metal and leather permeate the air of this shop. A stout Hithual wearing a leather apron barks an order to a young apprentice who lets out a yelp and rushes to the back of the shop to carry out his master's wishes. The shopkeeper mumbles about lazy youngsters and returns to oiling a fine looking leather weapon harness, leaving you to examine his wares on your own.   Some glowing quartz faced copper lanterns and an open polished oak door are here.
