A treacherous dusty trail leads west along the shaky fault line from a fork in the main road. The original roadbed has fallen into the chasm years ago, leaving the merchants to their own wiles to ply the slippery slopes past the fault zone. Many attempts have failed at conquering the shifting dirt and rocks. Currently a bumpy trail skirts the bigger rocks and loose gravel.   A wide eyed merchant's corpse is here.

The old merchant road lies in pieces at the bottom of a deep gorge far below. An artificial pathway has been constructed in the wake of the recent collapse, allowing continued passage through the mountains. This new merchant road has been constructed in great haste and is still quite unstable. Gravel that has been spread on the road to make it safer, is actually making it far more precarious. Pebbles roll continuously off of the roads surface and down into the chasm below.

The road ascends upward at a rather severe angle towards the northwest combined with the shifting road surface, it makes this particular passage very difficult for any merchants traveling with a large quantity of goods. A swiftly flowing river is visible several hundred feet below, and it can only be assumed that it was the cause of the collapse of old merchant road. The audible roar of the river is evident, even this far above.

A lone carrion bird seems to stare from the branches of a gnarled old tree. The road surface alternates between the usual hard-packed dirt covered in gravel, and solid rock. The terrain creates even more difficult travel for those heading north or south. A large pile of broken wagons, barrels, and boxes lie quite some distance below. Many skeletons of pack animals, picked clean by carrion birds, are also discernible. It is highly likely some of the bones are Humanoid as well.

A large pile of animal carcasses in various stages of decay is situated on a precarious ledge halfway up the cliff face. Bloody footprints from some sort of predatory animal are plainly visible along the edge of the path, providing a bit of insight into the decaying animal remains. The road reaches the top of the cliff up the gentle slope to the east.  Some greying oak planks are here.

There is an extremely large crevasse in the roadway that would normally prevent any further travel along this road. Astoundingly, someone has constructed a very sturdy looking bridge using two perfectly chiseled granite blocks. The blocks make up the support for the bridge structure, which is also constructed of chiseled granite slabs. There is seemingly no explanation for the excellent condition of this stretch of the road.  A sturdy granite bridge is here.

The cliff face to the north is wet, but there is no apparent source of the moisture. A slight overhang also creates a near permanent shadow in the area, providing a perfect atmosphere for the dense lichen that covers the rocks. Sporadic tufts of grass futilely attempt to assert themselves against the multi-colored lichen, but the spongy fungus prevails. Strange looking spiders scurry about amongst the lichen-covered rocks, before disappearing over the top of the cliff.

Small low-lying bushes with bright red berries dominate this stretch of the road. Many birds of various sizes and colors hop from bush to bush, chirping pleasantly as they feast upon the berries.

A large number of horses, carts, and merchants are congregated off the side of the road. They are either preparing for the journey down the cliff to the southwest, or are resting from the trip in the opposite direction. A dangerously high cliff is visible to the south, while to the east a flat plateau leads the roadway between two large mountains. The green hue of a forest is just visible between them.

The road is almost non-existent. The many large granite boulders that cover the path evidence the instability of the mountains to the north and south. The merchants who travel this road have erected a series of shoddy road signs to direct travelers safely around the boulders. Several of these signs point away from a shadowy area just off the side of the road. The rocks of the area seem to hang over the road slightly, blocking out the light. Light colored stringy material is barely visible along the side of the path.  A flimsy wooden sign, a flimsy wooden sign, a craggy overhang, and a slightly bloated merchant's corpse are here.

The merchant road ascends slightly to the east as it travels between two mountain peaks. Up the slopes to the north and south is a dense forest with massive red barked trees. Closer to the path, the forest begins to thin out and only a few trees have established themselves close to the road. The merchants who made this road did not bother to go around one of the largest, which is situated directly in the middle of the path.  An ancient towering rosewood tree is here.

Several tall rosewood trees litter the area. Just to the south is a small cliff no more than ten feet high, off of which flows a tiny picturesque waterfall.

The merchant road descends gently to the east, coming down from a pass between two large mountain peaks clearly visible to the southwest.

The tranquil terrain has been torn asunder to the northwest. One of the forces of nature has caused a great fissure to open in the earth. Although the fissure slopes downward at a severe angle, the terrain is surprisingly smooth and could be navigated even by a goods-loaded wagon. To the east a great deal of grass is growing on the road itself. It almost seems as if no one has used that road in a while.

Tufts of dried grass intermixed with broken rock cover the ground of this makeshift merchant road. The vicious rend that created this pathway reaches its lowest point here, drastically sloping upward in both directions. Massive walls of constantly shifting rock and earth stand a few hundred feet in the air to the southwest and the northeast. Every now and then a few rocks tumble down the sides on top the heads of unwary travelers.

Where there was once a craggy rock-studded earthen cliff, a massive rent has formed. Through the cleft to the southwest, travel seems possible.

This area of the path is fairly nondescript. A sparsely forested hill rises steeply to the south while a rocky grass covered hill rises to the north. Neither is particularly spectacular, save a lone male deer which grazes at a higher elevation on the southern hill. A few spare patches of grass grow alongside the path. The environment becomes more arid to the west.

The road slopes down slightly to the east, gently following a valley between two large hills. Ground dwelling rodents move about on the arid hill to the north gathering food. Large conifers, capable of withstanding the dry climate, sparsely populate the hill to the south. Visible among the tops of the trees are several majestic red-tailed Rathanian hawks. The screech of the hawks fills the air, as they hunt their small furry prey from above.

A large gap between two large hills to the north and west offers safe passage through this hilly terrain. A cold wind out of the northwest blows stiffly, whipping up the dust. The ground is so dry that most of the topsoil is easily pulled off by the strong winds. Large angry clouds of dust move back and forth throughout the area, wreaking havoc on the eyes and lungs of any that dare to pass through them.  A large thick cloud of dust is here.

A slight wind blows through the area, picking up speed as it continues southeast between two hills. The road drops down to the west through a deep gully before turning out of sight. There is quite a bit of debris on the road in that direction. A family of prairie dogs has dug a series of holes a few meters from the road. One is constantly on watch, attempting to keep the family safe from harm. At the slightest noise, it scurries back into its hole and out of sight.  An animal made hole is here.

One of the walls in this gully has collapsed inward, covering the road surface. The landslide is surely recent, as it is not yet packed down and is still rolling fresh dirt from above. It should be fairly easy to bypass this section of the road by climbing over the shifting dirt. Although surely dangerous, it might be possible to climb up the slide itself.  A landslide is here.

This section of the road is all that remains of the former mountain trail. The old pathway is visible to the north, however a large pile of moist earth, dull grey rock, and broken tree trunks has buried it several feet high making further passage impossible. It would seem this area is prone to landslides. A new road has been cut into the terrain to the southwest, heading in the direction of a smaller mountain peak. The old mountain trail is visible as it climbs up the barren mountainside to the north.

This narrow valley is enclosed on all sides by mountains. Just to the south of the path is a small lake full of what is surely ice cold water. Various small streamlets are visible running down a few of the surrounding snow-capped peaks, ensuring that the icy lake will remain filled.

The sturdy wooden walls and support beams surrounding you serve as an extension of the dark stone cavern that descends gradually into the depths of the earth. The smell of dried blood drifts in on a cool breeze from the cavern, only to be replaced by the over powering scent of burning sulfur. The walls of the cavern house several mounted display cases, each one stocked fully with potions featuring a range of effects from restoring life to taking the last breath of an unsuspecting victim. An intricately carved ash bookshelf stretches up toward the ceiling above, housing a large collection of books on anything from Arachnian alchemy techniques to Taathian torture rituals. The contents of each tome likely played a role in the development of the shop's inventory.   An intricately carved ash bookshelf, an open dark cavern, a closed rune-etched ebony door, and a closed display case are here.

The sturdy wooden walls and support beams surrounding you serve as an extension of the dark stone cavern that descends gradually into the depths of the earth. The smell of dried blood drifts in on a cool breeze from the cavern, only to be replaced by the over powering scent of burning sulfur. The walls of the cavern house several mounted display cases, each one stocked fully with potions featuring a range of effects from restoring life to taking the last breath of an unsuspecting victim. An intricately carved ash bookshelf stretches up toward the ceiling above, housing a large collection of books on anything from Arachnian alchemy techniques to Taathian torture rituals. The contents of each tome likely played a role in the development of the shop's inventory.   An intricately carved ash bookshelf, an open dark cavern, a closed rune-etched ebony door, and a closed display case are here.

The small crevice you entered through opens into a surprisingly large natural cavern. A heavily muscled matron arachnian clicks her mandibles at you challengingly from a ledge on the far wall, but doesn't move to attack. She eyes you warily instead, rythmically swaying her mandibles from side to side. Several glowing iron braziers of coal cast a steady glow, allowing easy inspection of the selection of goods securely webbed to the walls.   Some glowing iron braziers of coal, a closed thick grey steel armory, and a small crevice are here.

A massive rent opens up between the mountain side heading south. Boulders sit precariously on the mountain side ready to fall to the ground.

Old trees lay side by side with the massive boulders of the mountain, intermingling in a terrible landslide.

Withstanding seasonal floods and constant traffic, the durable road shows how affective good design and competent construction can be. It travels a hand paved berm straight to an imposing grey stone bridge to the southeast. The pilons of the bridge are cloaked in river mist as the raging river sweeps by. Only the brightness of the fluttering flags that top the spans stand out sharply.

>[Silver River Bridge.]

A massive stone bridge spans a raging grey tinted river as it runs it's course towards the southeast. The mud around the bridge footings has been churned by wheels of quarry wagons, tracks of sleds bearing block and tackle, shod hooves of draft beasts and booted feet of masons and bridge workers. The newer parts of the huge bridge are obvious due to the contrast in colors of mortar and rock. Bright banners snap briskly in the wind from both ends of the bridge.  A broken wooden wagon is here.

Mismatched mortar colors and varying types and cuts of the stone show the extent of the reconstruction made by quick working masons. A few proud workers chiseled their initials and the date into their handiwork, most reading the date of Rinannimas, 6th month, 61st day, year 313. Bright banners flutter in the breeze on both sides of the bridge as if in celebration of its victory over both the river's truculence and sabotage.

In the middle of the stone bridge's span, a carved stone plaque is set into the masonry of the rock wall. Worked black marble bears a likeness of a San Elf and a brief warning describing her and her crimes against the merchants who depend on this bridge for their livelihood.  A fat bloody merchant's corpse is here.

The river surges strongly below the stone span. Even from this height, the noise of the flowing water is near deafening. Two small fishing boats nearly collide as they try to tack between the same set of supports. Only skillful sailing prevents them from hitting each other, or the supports.

The huge stone bridge span was built tall to allow the various merchant ships to pass underneath. This amazing height affords a splendid view of the countryside: from the blur of smoky residential air to the southeast, across the verdant grasslands that cover the foothills, to the majestic peaks of the mountain range to the north.

The massive stone bridge expands over the raging river, it's huge pilons buried deep in the river's bottom. Within sight and just downstream, the water rushes past what remains of the old bridge, causing dangerous under-currents. Bright red bouys mark the broken fragments locations and signs tell of the peril. The river pilots earn their pay negotiating this treacherous obstacle.

Built to withstand the constant flooding of the large river, the roadbed here was constructed 3 feet higher then the rest of the valley floor. The competant engineers extended the berm further northwest until it became the footings of a stalwart rock bridge.

The metal grey river deposits a sandbar on its western bank near the merchant road, causing a snag of dead logs, branches and floating debris. A cat sized rodent, with long teeth, flat tail and webbed toes peaks briefly over the jumbled tangle of branches before dipping back into the frigid water without a splash.

The raging silver-cast river cuts through the grassland and heads southeast. Fishing boats, bearing the crest of the city of Spur, dart around several barges laden with exotic wares to trade in the merchant city. Most bear the purple livery of the city of Rathan, but every so often a ship flying unfamiliar colors can be sighted.

Just to the north, the roadway curves gently around a bend in a large river that flows towards the southeast. An enormous smooth round rock splits off a small eddy from the main current resulting a deep, clear pool by the eastern side of the road. The cool calm water catches the reflection of the white snowcapped mountain range further up the valley while the river rushes past towards Spur. Five fishermen recline on folding chairs or against rocks, tethered by the silvery lines of their poles to the fishing hole. Each fisherman is spread evenly around the pool as if held apart by some invisible barrier as they eye the large shadowy fish shapes finning effortlessly against the mild current in the eddy.

The road diverts around a small pool of murky water that lies to the north. A confusion of hoof prints muddies the shoreline where the placid bovines have come to water themselves. The pool is damned by a small hillock which allows no drainage so the pool remains stagnant. The mountains to the north reflect in perfectly upside-down symmetry on the still pond's surface, only wavering slightly in concentric circles to the deft touch of small insects.

A rickety criss-crossed rough beam fence pens the grazing of black and white cows whose ponderous forms are barely visible through the tall grass on either side of the road. To the north, the soft, undulating grassland floor of the wide valley succumbs to the rolling foothills, which in turn delineates the imposing outline of a vista-spanning mountain range. Many a traveler has witnessed this idyllic vantage point and has been drawn on to follow the road that travels into the heart of the mountains.

Grassy plains stretch out to the west across the wide flat valley broken only by the outline of a dark forest further to the southwest. The huge expanse of waving stalks is home to creatures large and small. Each has adapted to their own niche and are camouflaged from the casual observers gaze.

From the west spans a dark green forest of Sycamore and Beech trees that soak in the moister parts of the lower river valley. The tall, shaded forest breaks like a green tinged wave upon the tranquil calm of the grasslands. The huge trees within are ancient, reaching hundreds of feet into the air. As if steaming from a great cauldron, a heavy ground fog seeps from deep within the forest carrying with it the fresh smell of decomposing green matter.

Lush grass grows up to the borders of a thick, dense forest that cloaks the hills to the west. The grasslands thin near the grove as the huge trees completely shade the ground, and are replaced by taller bushes and juniper trees. The contrast between the waving stalks on the flat vista and the dark leaves of almost vertical trees is striking.

The noise and sputum of the big city stains the south eastern horizon through the vague outline of old-growth oaks, maples and cedars. This well traveled road transverses the flat terrain shouldered by weeds and vines and, due to the proximity of the city, small paths continuously cut through the road from either side.

In the dusty distance, Spur's great wall demarks the southern end of this well-traveled merchant's road. Soaring majestically to the north stands the spiky pinnacles and snow topped peaks of an epic mountain range so immense that it separates lands, races, and cultures. Connecting the two is a merchant road built long ago.

The path is flanked by countless tall oaks, swaying peacefully in the wind. They do their best to hide the sky from view, making it hard to tell night from day at times. Littering the area are pieces of broken wagon, bits of human remains and dried splotches of blood. The remnants of a violent fight lie all around you, whomever used to belong to the wagon is no more than vulture food.  A bloody severed foot is here.

Travelers from Rathan to the northwest, and the Trade Route to the south, converge at Spur's west gate. Guards posted on the ground give those seeking to enter the city a cursory once-over. Their lack of interest shows that anyone approaching has already been observed from above for some time. A grate in the ground loosens mud from wagon wheels and hooves before they pass through the gate, helping to keep the streets of Spur fairly clean.  An open giant patched steelwood gate, a giant green oak tree, a small blue pool, a thick oak grate over the pool, a polished stone marker, and a fluffy white layer of snow are here.

The relative safety inside Spur is a comfort to those returning from the fields and mountains. To those leaving, a massive wall of defense around the city lies ahead. Archer towers beside the gate overlook the wall, offering a painful welcome to would-be invaders. Several guards on foot patrol pass and disappear behind a thick, bluesteel banded steelwood door. Wall road stretches to the south, a wide passage between the city wall and several large buildings.  An open patched steelwood gate, an open thick stone door, a street lantern, and a fluffy white layer of snow are here.
