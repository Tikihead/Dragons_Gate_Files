[Town Square West.]

People carrying bundles stream in from the west and rapidly lose themselves in the large crowds moving about in the vast town square. Several citizens head west with bulging coinpurses babbling excitedly about what they're going to purchase. Giggling children dart around the slower moving folks rushing on their way to spend the silvers in their pockets.  A street lantern is here.

Merchants, some in frilly finery, others dressed in homespun wools, travel back and forth along this street on their way to and from work. They seem to blend together here, if only briefly. Several of the more haughty looking merchants are trailed by overloaded carts pushed along by haggard young apprentices.   A street lantern is here.

Several city guardsmen have just finished wrestling to the ground some young tough thieves, who thought to rob one of the returning merchants. To one side a relieved-looking Fir Elf gentleman holds on tightly to his gold-tipped walking stick, as the human boy yells his innocence to any who might listen. His pleas fall on deaf ears as the guards drag him away.  A street lantern is here.

Merchant Walk comes to an abrupt end at a massive moonsilver gate. The towering walls of Spur on either side of the gates force all to pass by the guards who are constantly on the watch for thieves and bandits. Just beyond the gates one can glimpse the bustling Merchant District of Spur.  A gilded oak sign and a street lantern are here.

[Trade Way.]

A large gate separates the Merchant District and Town Square-the hub of Spur's activity. The partially opened gate is currently able to accommodate the simultaneous passage of several locals and visitors, but can be expanded to accept carriages, or sealed to ward against invasion.  Guards stand sentry from atop the wall as well as the ground.  A street lantern is here.

Many townsfolk pass along this busy thoroughfare. Rich and poor alike mix freely on this street, much to the dismay of a passing nobleman. A young human struggles with an armful of packages and two young children in tow. Those in need of goods or supplies head west towards the market, those looking for the news of the day head east towards Town Square.  A street lantern is here.

An inviting eatery stands beside the road, its door open to those weary after a long trip to Spur, as well as those preparing to venture to the great expanses beyond the west gate. A human couple exit the building, arm in arm. A small sign stands beside the intersection.  A sign, an open glossy lacquered oak door, and a street lantern are here.

Deep grey mists surround a strange pile of rubble that lies south of the road. Occasionally a priest clad in a simple grey robe will wander past the rubble and whisper a short prayer under his breath. The fence running around the rubble is well kept, but the gate which once allowed entrance to this Temple has been chained closed.  A grey iron chained gate, a pile of rubble, and a street lantern are here.

The relative safety inside Spur is a comfort to those returning from the fields and mountains. To those leaving, a massive wall of defense around the city lies ahead. Archer towers beside the gate overlook the wall, offering a painful welcome to would-be invaders. Several guards on foot patrol pass and disappear behind a thick, bluesteel banded steelwood door. Wall road stretches to the south, a wide passage between the city wall and several large buildings.  An open iron gate, an open thick stone door, and a street lantern are here.

An acrid stench assails your nose before the source becomes apparent. Something quite large, but definitely dead and half-eaten, lies between two large ravens. Squawking noisily, they compete over the carrion. Muffled growls emanate from the tree-line, and a sudden rustling causes the birds to take flight, leaving their prize behind. Were those golden eyes flashing in the shadows?

With a wave and a nod, a Firian guard on the city wall indicates the way is clear.

An acrid stench assails your nose before the source becomes apparent. Something quite large, but definitely dead and half-eaten, lies between two large ravens. Squawking noisily, they compete over the carrion. Muffled growls emanate from the tree-line, and a sudden rustling causes the birds to take flight, leaving their prize behind.

Travelers from Rathan to the northwest, and the Trade Route to the south, converge at Spur's west gate. Guards posted on the ground give those seeking to enter the city a cursory once-over. Their lack of interest shows that anyone approaching has already been observed from above for some time. A grate in the ground loosens mud from wagon wheels and hooves before they pass through the gate, helping to keep the streets of Spur fairly clean.

This well-worn road separates the Bazaar to the north and Market Circle to the south. Only a Thugian could appreciate the layered odors of simmering foodstuffs and shoppers from the Bazaar. Crowds of people push past, some brushing against you. It might be a good idea to keep an eye on your coinpurse.  A street lantern is here.

A path to the north winds its way among various stalls and tents. Some specialty outlets can be found, provided one does not get lost in this maze known as the Bazaar. More permanent structures to the south suggest finer goods as well as increased security.  A street lantern is here.

Many townsfolk pass along this busy thoroughfare. Rich and poor alike mix freely on this street, much to the dismay of a passing nobleman. A young human struggles with an armful of packages and two young children in tow. Those in need of goods or supplies head west towards the market, those looking for the news of the day head east towards Town Square.  A street lantern is here.

A large gate separates the Merchant District and Town Square-the hub of Spur's activity. The partially opened gate is currently able to accommodate the simultaneous passage of several locals and visitors, but can be expanded to accept carriages, or sealed to ward against invasion.  Guards stand sentry from atop the wall as well as the ground.  A street lantern is here.

Merchant Walk comes to an abrupt end at a massive moonsilver gate. The towering walls of Spur on either side of the gates force all to pass by the guards who are constantly on the watch for thieves and bandits. Just beyond the gates one can glimpse the bustling Merchant District of Spur.  A gilded oak sign and a street lantern are here.

Several city guardsmen have just finished wrestling to the ground some young tough thieves, who thought to rob one of the returning merchants. To one side a relieved-looking Fir Elf gentleman holds on tightly to his gold-tipped walking stick, as the human boy yells his innocence to any who might listen. His pleas fall on deaf ears as the guards drag him away.  A street lantern is here.

Merchants, some in frilly finery, others dressed in homespun wools, travel back and forth along this street on their way to and from work. They seem to blend together here, if only briefly. Several of the more haughty looking merchants are trailed by overloaded carts pushed along by haggard young apprentices.   A street lantern is here.

A neatly kept park fronts this portion of Merchant Walk. Topiary and low shrubberies partition off small sections of the park. Young lovers sit on benches almost hidden from view, gazing at each other with looks of love, oblivious to the continual bustle of passing customers and merchants on their way to do business.

People carrying bundles stream in from the west and rapidly lose themselves in the large crowds moving about in the vast town square.

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.   A flowing white marble fountain, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a cracked marble statue of a Human, a carved marble statue of a Dragon, a rosewood sign, a small jagged cobblestone crack, a welcome mat, a two-handed steel scythe, some vomit, and a tattered list of customers are here.

The traffic on the northern street heading away from town square is an eclectic bunch.  Those who belong to the guilds to the north travel in packs on their way to and from guild events.  It is not unusual to see a group of armored fighters passing a group of robed clerics, each heading in the opposite direction. The large temple of Rinanni rises to the north, its white marble almost glowing in the light.  A street lantern is here.

Beds of wildflowers line the carefully placed cobblestones along this street. A pair of love birds, cooing in delight, sit upon a white marble bench.

The distant glimmer from a temple made of white marble and pearl catches your eye.

A large stone building rises just to the east of Northern Avenue. These barracks house those known as Dread Knights. It is not unusual to see patrols of this elite group heading down the street towards Town Square. One would hope their presence would allow everyone to live in peace. If only they would stop fingering their swords all the time, you might believe it yourself.  A street lantern is here.

The massive building of the Merchant's Guild looms over a vast part of the guild district.

While the governor has control over the city guard, many claim it is the Merchant's Guild that runs the city of Spur.  An open exquisite polished mahogany door and a street lantern are here.
