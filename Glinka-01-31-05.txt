>[Law Road & Shoteron Way.]

Law Road from the south and Shoteron Way from the east join before turning toward Town Square to the northwest. If one stays at this location long enough, they see the irony of these two roads joining. Most who are escorted south along Law Road are the criminals and ne'er-do-wells of the Spur, while those travel along Shoteron Way are the upper class residents whom live further east. Two office building, the City Planners Office and the Archmage's office stand on opposite sides of the road, each one neatly kept and freshly painted.  A street lantern, a closed gilded carved door, and a closed morbius door are here.

This area is illuminated.
Obvious paths: east* south* northwest*.

A shadowy black twisted free form metal sculpture stands on a small patch of grass at the beginning of Shoteron Way. Its unique design catches the light of both the sun and the moon. Below the memorial are several small items that have been left in passing. The well-manicured cobblestone path shows signs that it is well traveled, with enough room for even the largest cart or Leuian family.  A street lantern is here.

A low hedge grows between the Spurian Wall and the street. Flowers bloom on the hedge, and cheer up what might be a dreary view. Two guards lean over the tall wall and call down greetings to those who pass. At any time of the day, one may pass a Fir Elf on the way to market, or a Hithual stumbling home to sleep.  A street lantern and an open large wrought iron gate are here.

This area is illuminated.
Obvious paths: east* west*.
>[Cobblestone Lane.]

Several well placed street lanterns line the well kept cobblestone path. A towering oak tree sits off to the side of the path. Its leaves blow and twist displaying its various mint green colors. Nestled in its branches several blue birds call back and forth to one another in song. Floating grey clouds pass by overhead.  An open large wrought iron gate, a colorful cobblestone path, and a glowing tall wrought iron street lantern are here.

Adjacent to the street lanterns, two wooden benches lay next to the cobblestone path. A fluttering yellow and orange butterfly flits back and forth amongst large lilac trees displaying their purple hues. A gentle breeze picks up the sweet scent of the purple flowers and carries it across the lane.  A colorful cobblestone path, a glowing tall wrought iron street lantern, a rosewood bench, a flowering lilac tree, a white flowered rose bush, and a misty amethyst arch are here.

An ivy-covered wrought iron fence lines the cobblestone path to the west. Intricately sculpted hedges and elegant flower arrangements adorn the lawn behind it. Ivy has crept over to the street lanterns and entwined their way to the top. An enchanting landscape of lush green fields, adorned with vibrant flowers and trees can be seen in both directions.  A colorful cobblestone path and a glowing tall wrought iron street lantern are here.

Several well placed street lanterns line the well kept cobblestone path. A towering oak tree sits off to the side of the path. Its leaves blow and twist displaying its various red and yellow colors. Nestled in its branches several blue birds call back and forth to one another in song. Floating grey clouds pass by overhead. Large, double gates supported on either side by elegantly carved alabaster columns. Each gate bears a large, golden, rampant dragon. Through the gates you can see lush emerald green lawns, pale pink crushed shell paths, sculptures and a grove of stately maidenhair trees off to one side.  A colorful cobblestone path, a glowing tall wrought iron street lantern, and a closed large double gate are here.

Two tall pines stand sentinel on either side of the small white stone lane. A neatly manicured lawn rides up against a smooth stone wall on both the southern and northern property line. The white road is made up of identically sized white stones that are so perfectly fitted together it is hard to tell that the road is not one long single piece. A single wooden bench sits under one of the larger trees, a nice place to rest and reflect.  An open large pine gate is here.

The broad expanse of lawn is dotted with pine cones and various animals. The wind blowing through the tall pine trees whistles as the mighty branches sway and dance far above. The white stone road splits as it heads towards the east, leading towards several sets of low slung bungalows. On the north side of the road a small cottage sits nestled among the trees. On the south side of the road a handsome two-story building a sign hanging on the front is carved with the single word, "Office."  A closed intricate steelwood door and a closed solid bluesteel door are here.

This area is illuminated.
Obvious paths: northeast southeast west*.
[Majestic Pine Lane, North.]

Set among the large pine trees are four small white bungalows. Each with a uniquely colored door. They are set in an "L" shape, two of them north of the road and two of them east, a mirror reflection of the bungalows to the south. In front of each home is a beautiful garden, created to reflect the personality of those who live within. A well manicured courtyard sits in front of the homes dotted with smaller pines and benches. Small rabbits hop along unmolested nibbling upon the lush grass.  A closed blue pine door, a closed tan pine door, a closed red pine door, and a closed white pine door are here.

Thick plank floors are covered with a beautiful white and gold rug. Set upon the rug is a large overstuffed golden sofa. Threads of what look like pure spun gold run vertically throughout the sofa catching even the tiniest of light and reflecting it out to the walls of the bungalow. Behind a white slatted divider is a large bed, its white downy comforter falling to the floor. Beneath a large picture window that looks over the courtyard is a small wooden table with two chairs, perfect for a meal with a view.  An open white pine door, a large comfortable bed, a closed gold-trimmed white walnut chest, a glowing crystal orb, and a white framed glass window are here.

Osire bows to Green.

Rektger nods to Bethany.

Bethany's head suddenly begins glowing. She touches Rektger briefly. The glow travels down an arm to her hand. The glow quickly spreads over Rektger's entire body, then fades away.

[South gate.]

Through the gate lies the city of Spur, the major center of trade and civilization on the plains. The dusty road leading through the gates is well traveled, and walls of the city are in good repair. A small shack sits to the west of the road, during most times of the day a dusty coach can be seen waiting in front, its horses stomping with impatience to be gone. To the right of the door is a small window, its opening covered with metal bars. An old man, missing most of his teeth, waits patiently for the travelers to pay their fare, and then directs them into the waiting area. On the east side of the road a billowing multicolored tent has been erected, the hustle and bustle of merchants and customers can be seen coming and going at all times of the day.  An open iron gate and a rainbow silk tent are here.

[South Gate.]

A well-guarded gateway separates the city's residential district from the farmlands just beyond. Guards carefully eye all that enter or exit the city, beckoning gruffly to random travelers for a closer inspection. The structure of the guards' barracks is visible above the road to the west. A weathered wooden sign is posted by the gate.  An open stone gate, a wooden sign, an open thick stone door, and a street lantern are here.

The occasional locked gate marks the entrance to some of the more hidden estates of Spurs nobility. From this broad avenue, little can be seen of their splendor. Behind the imposing gate recedes a proud drive, disappearing mysteriously into the trees. If not for the large imposing tower rising above the hedges it would be hard to discern anything was beyond the gate. It is apparent the residents do not wish to be disturbed.  A street lantern, a closed morbius door, and an open black iron gate are here.

Majestic elms continue to line this broad roadway, sheltering the avenue on both sides and further enhancing the grandiose atmosphere. Fronting the beautiful homes, cobbled paths edged with narrow flower beds meander through nearby private gardens. Though they appear wonderful places to spend an afternoon or take a picnic, the glances from those tending the estates makes it clear they are only for the invited.  A street lantern is here.

A small roadway bordered by flowering hedges bisects the wide avenue of Noble Way at a right angle, heading east to west.  A thick, sturdy sign stands just off to the side of a charming path, its large friendly letters intent on luring travelers into the city's premiere roadstay, the Gilded Lion Inn. The entrance is clearly marked and welcoming, extending off to the southeast.  A wooden sign and a street lantern are here.

Occasional gates and driveways lead back into the well-kept estates of the city's nobility, breaking and adding interest to the defining plane of the walls lining Noble Way. The rest of the street seems to mimic the splendor of the estates beyond the wall. Swept and trimmed, the roadway exudes a simple, yet beautiful elegance.  A street lantern is here.

Numerous trees lining the avenue serve as the dividing border between the majestic estates of the nobility and the lightly traveled roadway. The estates themselves are noticeably closer to the avenue than those to the south. However, they are no easier to access, still protected by their own guarding walls, some covered with ivy or colorful blooming vines.  A street lantern is here.

The entire avenue is composed of fine cobblestone, each level with its neighbor, providing a smooth ride for passing carriages and horses.

Leaving the exceptionally wealthy estates of the Spurian nobility, Noble Way heads toward the Town Square to the northwest. Along the roadside can be seen the in-city homes of successful merchants and other wealthy citizens of the Spur. The homes display a slightly different style, perhaps they are not quite so restrained; a touch more exuberance and freedom with materials is displayed.  A street lantern is here.

Gazing down each of the nearby private drives reveals a glimpse of a luxurious home, each a miniature estate in its own right. Short, stout walls and manicured hedges serve to keep out the riffraff and to protect the small, expensive gardens.

Noble Way continues to wind its way among the rather modestly sized, but elegant, homes of the Spur's successful. Many a peasant farmer may live in homes larger than these, but none can match the quality found here.

Many grand, even ostentatious, homes line this stretch of Noble Way. Most of the residents here were fortunate enough to be born into the right families.

Some of these names could almost be considered famous.  A street lantern is here.

Atop the fountain is an intricately carved Secian who appears to be dancing with the water as it splashes around her. Set in the marble base is a small plaque that reads, "For those who have gone before us." Many stand for a moment as they pass this way, giving thanks for the gift of life that is given by both the apple tree and the Secians of long ago. Large piles of dirt and broken stone lay on either side of the street as workmen ready the east and west alleys for expansion.

Vast estates tower over the huge Spurian wall towards the south. The well-to-do who live in these homes idle away their days, enjoying the luxury of time. Standing next to a very empty lantern pole, a small Flerian child insists in a plaintive wail, that he had nothing to do with the missing lantern.

The outward appearance of the people here seems a bit classier. Rich clothing and large coin purses are prevalent amongst the travelers. In fact, many of the folk heading into Town Square from the south are accompanied by large bodyguards to assure their safety. The well maintained road is lined with small brass lanterns, each swinging off an individual pole. No expense has been spared to keep those who travel this road safe from the hoodlums that relish the darkness.  A street lantern is here.

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.   A flowing white marble fountain, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a marble statue of a Human, a rosewood sign, a white snow drift, and a highly polished marble statue of a Dragon are here.

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.   A flowing white marble fountain, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a marble statue of a Human, a rosewood sign, a white snow drift, and a highly polished marble statue of a Dragon are here.

The outward appearance of the people here seems a bit classier. Rich clothing and large coin purses are prevalent amongst the travelers. In fact, many of the folk heading into Town Square from the south are accompanied by large bodyguards to assure their safety. The well maintained road is lined with small brass lanterns, each swinging off an individual pole. No expense has been spared to keep those who travel this road safe from the hoodlums that relish the darkness.  A street lantern is here.

[Town Square South.]

The outward appearance of the people here seems a bit classier. Rich clothing and large coin purses are prevalent amongst the travelers. In fact, many of the folk heading into Town Square from the south are accompanied by large bodyguards to assure their safety. The well maintained road is lined with small brass lanterns, each swinging off an individual pole. No expense has been spared to keep those who travel this road safe from the hoodlums that relish the darkness.  A street lantern is here.

Southern Avenue leads between the center of Spur and the homes of the prosperous and wealthy.

Vast estates tower over the huge Spurian wall towards the south. The well-to-do who live in these homes idle away their days, enjoying the luxury of time. Standing next to a very empty lantern pole, a small Flerian child insists in a plaintive wail, that he had nothing to do with the missing lantern. The well-dressed guard that interrogates him keeps pointing at a small sack on the ground and its obvious contents.  An open small burlap sack, a street lantern, and a lantern are here.

The boughs of a large apple tree hang over the well tended avenue. Below the beautiful tree stands a small fountain. Atop the fountain is an intricately carved Secian who appears to be dancing with the water as it splashes around her. Set in the marble base is a small plaque that reads, "For those who have gone before us." Many stand for a moment as they pass this way, giving thanks for the gift of life that is given by both the apple tree and the Secians of long ago. Large piles of dirt and broken stone lay on either side of the street as workmen ready the east and west alleys for expansion.  A street lantern, an open Secian etched moonsilver door, a pair of open silver forged swinging doors, and a sign above the doors are here.

Standing next to the large iron gate that separates the center of town from those of the elite class are several of the Spurian Guard. They are here to assist all who pass with the simple kindness of opening a gate, or the more important task of escorting those in need to the bank or market.

An elegant, carved wooden sign hangs above the ornate gateway set into the massive wall that divides Spurs Noble District from the Town Square. You can make out city guardsmen peering down attentively at all that approach from their posts atop the imposing wall. They seem to take a greater interest in this part of town, though there does not seem to be anything threatening enough here to warrant such attention.

An unusually large home, even for this part of town, lies off to the west. It seems as if one ambitious owner is slowly buying up the lots next to his and adding them to his own. Groundskeepers are at work in the surrounding gardens, trimming and raking, so intent on their work they do not bother to acknowledge the passing traffic on the road.  A street lantern is here.

Some of these names could almost be considered famous.  A street lantern is here.

Noble Way continues to wind its way among the rather modestly sized, but elegant, homes of the Spur's successful. Many a peasant farmer may live in homes larger than these, but none can match the quality found here. A peaceful, luxurious feeling pervades this part of town; perhaps it is the drifting floral scents wafting from the well-tended gardens.

The occasional locked gate marks the entrance to some of the more hidden estates of Spurs nobility. From this broad avenue, little can be seen of their splendor. Behind the imposing gate recedes a proud drive, disappearing mysteriously into the trees. If not for the large imposing tower rising above the hedges it would be hard to discern anything was beyond the gate. It is apparent the residents do not wish to be disturbed.

A wooden signpost gives the directions and distances to the two closest cities. The arrow leading west is denoted as Spur, while the one directing east states Caersech. Next to the signpost rests an elderly druid amidst a cushion of moss, leaves, and flower petals. He is currently lecturing a young apprentice on the city of Spur and the negative effects it has had on nature.

A hedge of spiky brambles forms a natural division from the lands and the swampy terrain to the south. Tall, limbless trees dot the horizon there, their bases lost in the misty depths of the gases hovering over the waters. Now and then a strange, growling sound echos up to the north, or an odd, high-pitched call of some unseen crow, probably feasting on a fallen creature hidden in the mists. The path curves away from the sounds, as popular choice has preferred to travel around the edges, rather than through the marshy sludge.

Circling around the northern base of a small hill, there lies the lapping edge of the swamp to the south. Small slimy creatures lie on the smooth stones near the water, darting into it at the speed of light as you near them with tiny splashes and echoing wakes blending into the small, gentle waves coming into the shore. Swarms of mosquitoes move along the land in unison, lending them the appearance of large, unified bodies hovering around for the next feast.

Yet through death there be life again, any number of these ravens being sustained through this death, so they may live. Perhaps only to become sustenance for one of the swamp creatures, who, in turn, spends its life continuing the cycle.

An ancient willow tree and a simple well dominate the center of this small trading post, providing rest and refreshment to travelers. Several modest buildings are built close against a sturdy stone wall which surrounds the entire post, protecting it from the surrounding wilderness. A strong, iron gate is the only exit in or out of the post. Near the gate is a wooden sign written in large friendly script.  A stone well, a wooden sign, and an open iron gate are here.

Tables and chairs of wrought iron sit on a large porch fronting the entrance to "The Mug". During the warmer months, travelers often choose to relax in the open air outside the tavern in an effort to catch a cool breeze. On the floor of the porch is a tiled mosaic of a silver beer stein with foam dripping enticingly over the side. No matter the hour, laughter, music, and an occasional loud whoop or an angry outburst of vulgar swearing drift out through the door.   An open crystalla door is here.

Elegant iron sconces hang from the walls, the candles providing dim light throughout the hazy, smoke-filled room. A scantily clad San Elf woman dexterously mixes drinks and sets them out for weary travelers resting their tired. They nod to her appreciatively and turn their attention back to a polished black stage where a lone gypsy girl dances. Colorful paintings brighten the walls and two large windows to either side of the entrance overlook the center of town.

Elegant iron sconces hang from the walls, the candles providing dim light throughout the hazy, smoke-filled room. A scantily clad San Elf woman dexterously mixes drinks and sets them out for weary travelers resting their tired. They nod to her appreciatively and turn their attention back to a polished black stage where a lone gypsy girl dances. Colorful paintings brighten the walls and two large windows to either side of the entrance overlook the center of town.  A bar, a dartboard, a framed painting, an open crystalla door, an open oak door, a frosted mug of Saldean wheat ale, a bowl of rich noodle soup, a whiskey sour, and some vomit are here.

Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.   A flowing white marble fountain, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a marble statue of a Human, a rosewood sign, a white snow drift, and a highly polished marble statue of a Dragon are here.

[Town Square Center.]

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.   A flowing white marble fountain, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a marble statue of a Human, a rosewood sign, a white snow drift, and a highly polished marble statue of a Dragon are here.

This area is illuminated.
You see the 1st orange and black spotted, winged faecat (wearing a small gold collar).
In the area are Methoss the Drag-al, Greolin the Noble Drag-al, Kavita the Noble Secian (seated), Davide the Usil Elf, Caylith the Drake, Jesstine the Secian, Kiki the Secian (holding a glowing finely woven silver mesh cage of fireflies), Grau the Drag-al (holding a flaming dragon shaped rosewood pipe), Rydareon the Drake, Xavier the Human, Mael the Thugian, and Raptorian the Noble Secian (holding a glowing sparkling blue orb of Sa).

[Town Square Center.]

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.   A flowing white marble fountain, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a marble statue of a Human, a rosewood sign, a white snow drift, and a highly polished marble statue of a Dragon are here.

People carrying bundles stream in from the west and rapidly lose themselves in the large crowds moving about in the vast town square.

An inviting eatery stands beside the road, its door open to those weary after a long trip to Spur, as well as those preparing to venture to the great expanses beyond the west gate. A human couple exit the building, arm in arm. A small sign stands beside the intersection.  A sign, an open glossy lacquered oak door, and a street lantern are here.

[Trade Way.]

This well-worn road separates the Bazaar to the north and Market Circle to the south. Only a Thugian could appreciate the layered odors of simmering foodstuffs and shoppers from the Bazaar. Crowds of people push past, some brushing against you. It might be a good idea to keep an eye on your coinpurse.  A street lantern is here.

[Trade Way & Bazaar Path.]

A path to the north winds its way among various stalls and tents. Some specialty outlets can be found, provided one does not get lost in this maze known as the Bazaar. More permanent structures to the south suggest finer goods as well as increased security.  A street lantern is here.

This area is illuminated.
You see the 1st city guard archer, the 2nd city guard archer, and the 3rd city guard archer.

Many townsfolk pass along this busy thoroughfare. Rich and poor alike mix freely on this street, much to the dismay of a passing nobleman. A young human struggles with an armful of packages and two young children in tow. Those in need of goods or supplies head west towards the market, those looking for the news of the day head east towards Town Square.  A street lantern is here.

A large gate separates the Merchant District and Town Square-the hub of Spur's activity. The partially opened gate is currently able to accommodate the simultaneous passage of several locals and visitors, but can be expanded to accept carriages, or sealed to ward against invasion.  Guards stand sentry from atop the wall as well as the ground.  A street lantern is here.

Merchant Walk comes to an abrupt end at a massive moonsilver gate. The towering walls of Spur on either side of the gates force all to pass by the guards who are constantly on the watch for thieves and bandits. Just beyond the gates one can glimpse the bustling Merchant District of Spur.  A gilded oak sign and a street lantern are here.

Several city guardsmen have just finished wrestling to the ground some young tough thieves, who thought to rob one of the returning merchants. To one side a relieved-looking Fir Elf gentleman holds on tightly to his gold-tipped walking stick, as the human boy yells his innocence to any who might listen. His pleas fall on deaf ears as the guards drag him away.  A street lantern is here.

Merchants, some in frilly finery, others dressed in homespun wools, travel back and forth along this street on their way to and from work. They seem to blend together here, if only briefly. Several of the more haughty looking merchants are trailed by overloaded carts pushed along by haggard young apprentices.   A street lantern and a closed sturdy red door are here.

A neatly kept park fronts this portion of Merchant Walk. Topiary and low shrubberies partition off small sections of the park. Young lovers sit on benches almost hidden from view, gazing at each other with looks of love, oblivious to the continual bustle of passing customers and merchants on their way to do business.  A street lantern is here.

[Town Square West.]

People carrying bundles stream in from the west and rapidly lose themselves in the large crowds moving about in the vast town square. Several citizens head west with bulging coinpurses babbling excitedly about what they're going to purchase. Giggling children dart around the slower moving folks rushing on their way to spend the silvers in their pockets.  A street lantern is here.

[Town Square Center.]

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.   A flowing white marble fountain, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a marble statue of a Human, a rosewood sign, a white snow drift, a highly polished marble statue of a Dragon, and a frosted mug of Saldean wheat ale are here.

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.   A flowing white marble fountain, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a marble statue of a Human, a rosewood sign, a white snow drift, a highly polished marble statue of a Dragon, a frosted mug of Saldean wheat ale, a glass of elven wine, a glass of elven wine, a glass of elven wine, a glass of elven wine, a glass of elven wine, and some vomit are here.

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.   A flowing white marble fountain, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a marble statue of a Human, a rosewood sign, a white snow drift, a highly polished marble statue of a Dragon, a frosted mug of Saldean wheat ale, a glass of elven wine, a glass of elven wine, a glass of elven wine, a glass of elven wine, a glass of elven wine, and some vomit are here.

A closed intricate steelwood door and a closed solid bluesteel door are here.

This area is illuminated.
Obvious paths: northeast southeast west*.
[Majestic Pine Lane, North.]

Set among the large pine trees are four small white bungalows. Each with a uniquely colored door. They are set in an "L" shape, two of them north of the road and two of them east, a mirror reflection of the bungalows to the south. In front of each home is a beautiful garden, created to reflect the personality of those who live within. A well manicured courtyard sits in front of the homes dotted with smaller pines and benches. Small rabbits hop along unmolested nibbling upon the lush grass.  A closed blue pine door, a closed tan pine door, a closed red pine door, and a closed white pine door are here.

[Town Square Center.]

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.   A flowing white marble fountain, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a marble statue of a Human, a rosewood sign, a white snow drift, a highly polished marble statue of a Dragon, a frosted mug of Saldean wheat ale, a glass of elven wine, a glass of elven wine, a glass of elven wine, a glass of elven wine, a glass of elven wine, and some vomit are here.

[Town Square South.]

The outward appearance of the people here seems a bit classier. Rich clothing and large coin purses are prevalent amongst the travelers. In fact, many of the folk heading into Town Square from the south are accompanied by large bodyguards to assure their safety. The well maintained road is lined with small brass lanterns, each swinging off an individual pole. No expense has been spared to keep those who travel this road safe from the hoodlums that relish the darkness.  A street lantern is here.

The traffic on the northern street heading away from town square is an eclectic bunch.  Those who belong to the guilds to the north travel in packs on their way to and from guild events.  It is not unusual to see a group of armored fighters passing a group of robed clerics, each heading in the opposite direction. The large temple of Rinanni rises to the north, its white marble almost glowing in the light.  A street lantern is here.

The elegant Hotel Royale towers above the street, its emerald door sparkling in the light. The patrons that stroll in and out are catered to, doors opened and closed for them, and baggage and packages carried by harried servants. The large Bank of Spur sits on the east side of the square. Its location close to the Royale is not a coincidence. A gold-trimmed door is proof of the success of this branch of the Spurian bank and those who run it.  An elegant gold-trimmed walnut door, an open emerald steel door, and a street lantern are here.
