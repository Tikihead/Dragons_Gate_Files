No plants can possibly grow on the ground in these inhospitable conditions, and only various fungi and lichen seem to be thriving.  Some giant spotted mushrooms and a crooked crumbling stone bridge are here.

An acrid stench assails your nose before the source becomes apparent. Something quite large, but definitely dead and half-eaten, lies between two large ravens. Squawking noisily, they compete over the carrion. Muffled growls emanate from the tree-line, and a sudden rustling causes the birds to take flight, leaving their prize behind.

Travelers from Rathan to the northwest, and the Trade Route to the south, converge at Spur's west gate. Guards posted on the ground give those seeking to enter the city a cursory once-over. Their lack of interest shows that anyone approaching has already been observed from above for some time. A grate in the ground loosens mud from wagon wheels and hooves before they pass through the gate, helping to keep the streets of Spur fairly clean.

A rickety criss-crossed rough beam fence pens the grazing of black and white cows whose ponderous forms are barely visible through the tall grass on either side of the road. To the north, the soft, undulating grassland floor of the wide valley succumbs to the rolling foothills, which in turn delineates the imposing outline of a vista-spanning mountain range.

The pool is damned by a small hillock which allows no drainage so the pool remains stagnant. The mountains to the north reflect in perfectly upside-down symmetry on the still pond's surface, only wavering slightly in concentric circles to the deft touch of small insects.

As the road bends around a curve, ruts left by merchant's wagons cut so deeply into the mud that all wheeled vehicles are forced to follow the set path. Four loaded wagons of a merchants caravan stand idle as one larger than standard wagon skitters along the path. The buckboard's frame groans and strains to keep it inline while the driver attempts to negotiate the turn. Four dark maned, matched mules balk at the noise behind them, and stomp nervously over the deep ruts. The liveried caravan guards attempt to haul the mules forward, further adding to the mules stubborn refusal to move.

Just to the north, the roadway curves gently around a bend in a large river that flows towards the southeast. An enormous smooth round rock splits off a small eddy from the main current resulting a deep, clear pool by the eastern side of the road. The cool calm water catches the reflection of the white snowcapped mountain range further up the valley while the river rushes past towards Spur. Five fishermen recline on folding chairs or against rocks, tethered by the silvery lines of their poles to the fishing hole. Each fisherman is spread evenly around the pool as if held apart by some invisible barrier as they eye the large shadowy fish shapes finning effortlessly against the mild current in the eddy.

A massive stone bridge spans a raging grey tinted river as it runs it's course towards the southeast. The mud around the bridge footings has been churned by wheels of quarry wagons, tracks of sleds bearing block and tackle, shod hooves of draft beasts and booted feet of masons and bridge workers. The newer parts of the huge bridge are obvious due to the contrast in colors of mortar and rock. Bright banners snap briskly in the wind from both ends of the bridge.  A broken wooden wagon is here.

Withstanding seasonal floods and constant traffic, the durable road shows how affective good design and competent construction can be. It travels a hand paved berm straight to an imposing grey stone bridge to the southeast. The pilons of the bridge are cloaked in river mist as the raging river sweeps by. Only the brightness of the fluttering flags that top the spans stand out sharply.

A brown and white osprey soars above the raging river, scanning the water for a meal. Suddenly, it dives down to the surface and snatches a rather large trout from the water. The trout wriggles helplessly in the large birds grip as it is carried off to a nest of sticks and twigs high in the distant treetops.

On the northern edge of the road stands a tall, flat rock. Chipped into the shape of a pillar and abraded to smoothness, it bears the stamped surveyor's mark of the road's builder. The mark's grooved letters are filled with sand and dust and obscured from age, but the arrows delineating north, south, east and west are clear and easy to read. The rest of the stamp is undecipherable and lends mystery to the road's origin.

Boulders stacked in pyramids contained by large timbers stand mutely to the side of the roadway next to an impromptu dump of broken tools, wooden stakes and empty buckets lined with mortar. Deeply grooved sled tracks lead to the east towards the bridge from this part of the road where the flatness of the valley was best suited for the staging area during the bridge's reconstruction. Smooth rectangles of tent foundations still mark their location in a semi circle around a blackened fire ring where the workers and their supervisors lived during it's rebuilding.

The decaying remains of the bridge workers camp sprawls across this flat valley. To house their draft beasts, the workers constructed small stalls and shelters from rickety boards nailed quixotically to the standing trees. Three brass ring topped posts lie sunk into the grasslands turf, to the south, which was most likely used for tethering grazing animals. Between the posts is a rough stone trough that is filled automatically with water by a rickety mechanical wind mill, whirling lazily in the breeze.

Water loving trees hug the river's course through the low lying valley. Giant beech and huge alders vie for the valuable sodden shoreline and shade the understory bushes and ferns from direct sunlight. The result is a lushly green, verdant forest that obscures the river from the view on the road, though the hiss of rushing water reveals it's course.

Running parallel to the road is a smooth rock lined trench that channels the road's run-off during rainstorms. This flat part of the road that follows the valley floor would be prone to turn into a muddy bog and therefore a hazard to most caravans and their pack animals. Anticipating this event, the road's engineers built drains into the lower side of the road that carry the runoff into the culvert, which carries it harmlessly down to the low end of the valley.

The roadway takes advantage of a cut in the hill to negotiate a tumbled cliff face. At the top of the hill is a high, flat, steppe grassland, and at the bottom is the edge of the open range. At one point, the road narrows to cross a small stream. Very little mud gathers in the shallows of the stream and the pebbles and rocks glitter like gold as the wagon wheels churn the gravel.

Their roots have plied across the road, upending it's hand laid foundation and hand pounded bed. Several large knees of the oak's roots have leveraged up the edges of the road, hindering all wagons' passage and threatening to break spokes and axles.

Thicker stalked grasses grow here on this high plateau where the air is rarified and rain spills quickly down the small rocky gullies. A few staunch oaks grow alone or in groups of one or two, their roots exposed where they cling to the rocky soil for sustenance. Thin, scraggly junipers suck up what little moisture the soil does manage to hold. The merchant road placidly passes by, untouched by time in the dry environment.

All manner of beasts are drawn to the springs and the protection they offer. Bright blue scrub jays chatter noisily among themselves as they dart and swerve in accomplished aerial feats pursuing their winged insect meals. A small herd of wary jackrabbits stop munching the grass to turn their white ears towards the merchant road. The nearest jack to the road stands on his hind legs and tests the air for any scent of their many predators.

Often referred to as "badlands", the sheered rocks, broken cliffs and ridged terrain would be impassable if not for the road. A narrow, steep walled canyon juts to the southeast, disappearing into the convoluted, rippled hills.

A short vibration shudders the roadbed, causing dust and gravel to shimmy down the canyon walls. A few larger rocks ping and ricochet off boulders, until all is deadly silent.  The merchant road is dusted with bits of broken rock, covering any recent tracks.

The rocky valley walls widen to the accommodate the splitting of the Tarath fault line. The Great Divide towers to the north beyond the fractured, broken badlands. Sheer, monolithic cliffs dropping for thousands of feet front the western edge of the mountains; their sharp, snow-capped peaks vaulting nearly vertically from the floor of the fault line valley. The merchant road bed is cracked and broken as it negotiates the larger twists and turns.

The trembling fault line reveals the cataclysmic trauma of the solid bedrock beneath the mountains. Striations of tortured, twisted rock bent almost in half under the strain stand out dramatically against darker, older layers of bedrock.

A short tremor suddenly rocks the cracked merchant road! A dusty pall sifts into the air from cracks in the ground and the shifting of gravel around the valley.  The tremor rolls through the canyon walls like a ripple, as if it were a linen sheet that was lifted and settled again. Pack animals and travelers alike stop momentarily and then hasten their pace as if to leave the quake behind them.

As the merchant road approaches the western end of the valley, the valley wall abruptly falls away to a sheer drop. Crumbling rock and dirt spill constantly into the deep abyss. Sections of the mountain have slid away into the valley and the merchant road has been rebuilt higher along the steeper sides of the mountain. The fault line of broken rocks continues its path of destruction to the west, skirted by the land-slide prone softer dirt.   A freshly uncovered crevice and an open plain steelwood box are here.

A treacherous dusty trail leads west along the shaky fault line from a fork in the main road. The original roadbed has fallen into the chasm years ago, leaving the merchants to their own wiles to ply the slippery slopes past the fault zone. Many attempts have failed at conquering the shifting dirt and rocks. Currently a bumpy trail skirts the bigger rocks and loose gravel.

You stand before a gate about 3 feet high, yellowing and rusty from years of use. It doesn't look like anyone takes care of it regularly. A sign is sticking out of the ground off the side of the path, slightly crooked. The writing on the board is crudely scrawled into the wood, reading "Wolf Trap". You can only assume that is the name given to the quiet town seen past the gate.  An open rusting gate and a wagon are here.

The area around you seems lifeless and empty. Dominating the otherwise bare Town Square is a large fountain. The fountain's base is circular, with the statue of a wolf howling at the moon in the middle. The structure is devoid of water, and the stone has grown faded and bleached from the sun. Faded marks, where the fountain water used to flow, run down the wolf's chin.  A faded dry stone fountain is here.

A deformed, shadowy figure sits at a table in the shadows. No one approaches him, and you aren't the least bit inclined to do so either. His facial features are hidden by a heavy cloak. He grabs your sleeve, fixing you with a deranged gaze and says, "I sell rare items that I find in my travels. I don't often have goods for sale, but when I do they are of the highest quality". You wonder if his story has as many holes in it as his shirt.  An open door is here.

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.   A flowing white marble fountain, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a marble statue of a Human, a carved marble statue of a Dragon, and a rosewood sign are here.

The area around you seems lifeless and empty. Dominating the otherwise bare Town Square is a large fountain. The fountain's base is circular, with the statue of a wolf howling at the moon in the middle. The structure is devoid of water, and the stone has grown faded and bleached from the sun. Faded marks, where the fountain water used to flow, run down the wolf's chin.  A faded dry stone fountain, a short hatchet, and a closed muddy iron chest are here.

[Wolf Trap-Town Square.]

The area around you seems lifeless and empty. Dominating the otherwise bare Town Square is a large fountain. The fountain's base is circular, with the statue of a wolf howling at the moon in the middle. The structure is devoid of water, and the stone has grown faded and bleached from the sun. Faded marks, where the fountain water used to flow, run down the wolf's chin.  A faded dry stone fountain is here.

The area around you seems lifeless and empty. Dominating the otherwise bare Town Square is a large fountain. The fountain's base is circular, with the statue of a wolf howling at the moon in the middle. The structure is devoid of water, and the stone has grown faded and bleached from the sun. Faded marks, where the fountain water used to flow, run down the wolf's chin.  A faded dry stone fountain is here.

A sign is sticking out of the ground off the side of the path, slightly crooked. The writing on the board is crudely scrawled into the wood, reading "Wolf Trap". You can only assume that is the name given to the quiet town seen past the gate.  An open rusting gate and a wagon are here.

A treacherous dusty trail leads west along the shaky fault line from a fork in the main road. The original roadbed has fallen into the chasm years ago, leaving the merchants to their own wiles to ply the slippery slopes past the fault zone. Many attempts have failed at conquering the shifting dirt and rocks. Currently a bumpy trail skirts the bigger rocks and loose gravel.

As the merchant road approaches the western end of the valley, the valley wall abruptly falls away to a sheer drop. Crumbling rock and dirt spill constantly into the deep abyss. Sections of the mountain have slid away into the valley and the merchant road has been rebuilt higher along the steeper sides of the mountain. The fault line of broken rocks continues its path of destruction to the west, skirted by the land-slide prone softer dirt.   A freshly uncovered crevice is here.

A short tremor suddenly rocks the cracked merchant road! A dusty pall sifts into the air from cracks in the ground and the shifting of gravel around the valley.  The tremor rolls through the canyon walls like a ripple, as if it were a linen sheet that was lifted and settled again. Pack animals and travelers alike stop momentarily and then hasten their pace as if to leave the quake behind them.

Sheer, monolithic cliffs dropping for thousands of feet front the western edge of the mountains; their sharp, snow-capped peaks vaulting nearly vertically from the floor of the fault line valley. The merchant road bed is cracked and broken as it negotiates the larger twists and turns.

The momentous forces that have wrought this valley still press upon the land and have done so for eons.  The walls of the valley are sheer and steep, and untouched by the raging waters of river or stream.  As if in testimony to the power of the forces that move the land, a huge dark boulder sits off to the side of the road. It is hewn in half like a sliced melon.  One part sits 20 feet north along the break in the rocks from the other part.

One layer of rock in the steep walls has eroded faster then the harder granite or bedrock above and below it. Soft sandstone has been stripped away to form an arch in the valley wall ... a concave indention that goes for hundreds of feet in both directions.

The merchant road threads through bottom of the small, narrow valley. Sheer granite walls block the view from the well traveled road to either side and above, only a narrow ray of sky testifies to the time of day. The engineers set a route as far as possible from the broken stones in the center of the valley and, by luck or design, this foresight has saved the road-bed from constant reconstruction. Small cracks run parallel to the road, but none have broken through the thick layers of sand and stone.

The merchant road cuts straight through a hill where men and beasts must have toiled to remove tons of blasted rock and dirt. The choice to remove hundreds of feet of hillside was more prudent to the road engineers then a long series of switch-backs that would have to climb the steep hillside for hundreds of feet. Tube shaped holes drilled into the bedrock still remain from when the roadbed was blasted eons years ago.

All manner of beasts are drawn to the springs and the protection they offer. Bright blue scrub jays chatter noisily among themselves as they dart and swerve in accomplished aerial feats pursuing their winged insect meals. A small herd of wary jackrabbits stop munching the grass to turn their white ears towards the merchant road. The nearest jack to the road stands on his hind legs and tests the air for any scent of their many predators.

Off to the side of the road, perhaps a hundred feet away, stands an enormous tree that commands the attention of all who pass this direction. It's offspring populate the plateau for miles in both directions. At one time, the tree must have stood alone on the prairie soil and dropped acorns year after year until one tree became a huge forest of oaks.

The merchant road follows a bumpy path through the oak forest. Each stately old tree has added a few feet to it's girth since the road was first surveyed and constructed hundreds of years ago. Their roots have plied across the road, upending it's hand laid foundation and hand pounded bed. Several large knees of the oak's roots have leveraged up the edges of the road, hindering all wagons' passage and threatening to break spokes and axles.

The merchant road makes a wide turn as it passes through the thick oak forest. A tiny meadow with a murmuring creek is the only open spot in sight. Bright wildflowers and fragrant mosses crowd around a sparkling jewel of a pond while the huge oaks stand like sentinels around the edges. A spotted fawn and its doe-eyed mother drink cautiously, swishing their white edged tails quickly.

Crunching loudly on the road is a ankle high deposit of acorn hulls and their discarded caps. Quick footed grey squirrels dash across the road, or above on the high intertwined branches of the stately oaks, with the highly coveted acorns grasped firmly in their teeth. The squirrels flash their tails at each other in some unknown signal as traffic passes on the road.  A pile of empty acorn caps is here.

The grassland plateau is embraced by a stand of dark green oak trees so thick that little light passes through the profusion of their many lobed leaves. The forest is ancient and the trunks of the trees bare witness to fires, lightning strikes and the attacks of insects. Large gout-like burls disfigure some of the wide, grey trunks which have grown quietly next to the road for hundreds of years.

The merchant roads widens as it travels another grass swept plateau. The mountain range fills the northern skyline in stark detail. Huge snow capped peaks and rough faced cliffs are close enough to see the individual boulders, waterfalls, and haphazard game trails. Much higher up the great mountainsides a line where trees stop growing gives testament to the altitude. The air is cool.

The roadway takes advantage of a cut in the hill to negotiate a tumbled cliff face. At the top of the hill is a high, flat, steppe grassland, and at the bottom is the edge of the open range. At one point, the road narrows to cross a small stream. Very little mud gathers in the shallows of the stream and the pebbles and rocks glitter like gold as the wagon wheels churn the gravel.

White barked birch trees populate the moist valleys that drain into the river to the southeast as the merchant road passes nearby.

With the care and attention to detail rarely given to a mundane project such as a road, the engineers foresaw potential hazards and built the solutions into their finished project.

Running parallel to the road is a smooth rock lined trench that channels the road's run-off during rainstorms. This flat part of the road that follows the valley floor would be prone to turn into a muddy bog and therefore a hazard to most caravans and their pack animals. Anticipating this event, the road's engineers built drains into the lower side of the road that carry the runoff into the culvert, which carries it harmlessly down to the low end of the valley.

Water loving trees hug the river's course through the low lying valley. Giant beech and huge alders vie for the valuable sodden shoreline and shade the understory bushes and ferns from direct sunlight. The result is a lushly green, verdant forest that obscures the river from the view on the road, though the hiss of rushing water reveals it's course.

The decaying remains of the bridge workers camp sprawls across this flat valley. To house their draft beasts, the workers constructed small stalls and shelters from rickety boards nailed quixotically to the standing trees. Three brass ring topped posts lie sunk into the grasslands turf, to the south, which was most likely used for tethering grazing animals. Between the posts is a rough stone trough that is filled automatically with water by a rickety mechanical wind mill, whirling lazily in the breeze.

Boulders stacked in pyramids contained by large timbers stand mutely to the side of the roadway next to an impromptu dump of broken tools, wooden stakes and empty buckets lined with mortar. Deeply grooved sled tracks lead to the east towards the bridge from this part of the road where the flatness of the valley was best suited for the staging area during the bridge's reconstruction. Smooth rectangles of tent foundations still mark their location in a semi circle around a blackened fire ring where the workers and their supervisors lived during it's rebuilding.

On the northern edge of the road stands a tall, flat rock. Chipped into the shape of a pillar and abraded to smoothness, it bears the stamped surveyor's mark of the road's builder. The mark's grooved letters are filled with sand and dust and obscured from age, but the arrows delineating north, south, east and west are clear and easy to read. The rest of the stamp is undecipherable and lends mystery to the road's origin.

A brown and white osprey soars above the raging river, scanning the water for a meal. Suddenly, it dives down to the surface and snatches a rather large trout from the water.

Withstanding seasonal floods and constant traffic, the durable road shows how affective good design and competent construction can be. It travels a hand paved berm straight to an imposing grey stone bridge to the southeast. The pilons of the bridge are cloaked in river mist as the raging river sweeps by. Only the brightness of the fluttering flags that top the spans stand out sharply.

A massive stone bridge spans a raging grey tinted river as it runs it's course towards the southeast. The mud around the bridge footings has been churned by wheels of quarry wagons, tracks of sleds bearing block and tackle, shod hooves of draft beasts and booted feet of masons and bridge workers. The newer parts of the huge bridge are obvious due to the contrast in colors of mortar and rock. Bright banners snap briskly in the wind from both ends of the bridge.  A broken wooden wagon is here.

Mismatched mortar colors and varying types and cuts of the stone show the extent of the reconstruction made by quick working masons. A few proud workers chiseled their initials and the date into their handiwork, most reading the date of Rinannimas, 6th month, 61st day, year 313.

Just to the north, the roadway curves gently around a bend in a large river that flows towards the southeast. An enormous smooth round rock splits off a small eddy from the main current resulting a deep, clear pool by the eastern side of the road. The cool calm water catches the reflection of the white snowcapped mountain range further up the valley while the river rushes past towards Spur. Five fishermen recline on folding chairs or against rocks, tethered by the silvery lines of their poles to the fishing hole. Each fisherman is spread evenly around the pool as if held apart by some invisible barrier as they eye the large shadowy fish shapes finning effortlessly against the mild current in the eddy.

As the road bends around a curve, ruts left by merchant's wagons cut so deeply into the mud that all wheeled vehicles are forced to follow the set path. Four loaded wagons of a merchants caravan stand idle as one larger than standard wagon skitters along the path. The buckboard's frame groans and strains to keep it inline while the driver attempts to negotiate the turn. Four dark maned, matched mules balk at the noise behind them, and stomp nervously over the deep ruts. The liveried caravan guards attempt to haul the mules forward, further adding to the mules stubborn refusal to move.

Travelers from Rathan to the northwest, and the Trade Route to the south, converge at Spur's west gate. Guards posted on the ground give those seeking to enter the city a cursory once-over. Their lack of interest shows that anyone approaching has already been observed from above for some time. A grate in the ground loosens mud from wagon wheels and hooves before they pass through the gate, helping to keep the streets of Spur fairly clean.

The relative safety inside Spur is a comfort to those returning from the fields and mountains. To those leaving, a massive wall of defense around the city lies ahead.

Wall road stretches to the south, a wide passage between the city wall and several large buildings.  An open iron gate, an open thick stone door, and a street lantern are here.

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.   A flowing white marble fountain, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a marble statue of a Human, a carved marble statue of a Dragon, a rosewood sign, and an open patched spidersilk sack are here.

[Town Square East.]

Travel to the eastern portion of Town Square finds battle clad warriors shoulder to shoulder with chained criminals and those who live outside the Spurian Walls. The cobblestones that line the street are stained with blood.  It is unknown as to whether the blood is from guards carrying out quick executions, or gladiators who refused to wait their turn for arena space.  A street lantern is here.

The outward appearance of the people here seems a bit classier. Rich clothing and large coin purses are prevalent amongst the travelers. In fact, many of the folk heading into Town Square from the south are accompanied by large bodyguards to assure their safety. The well maintained road is lined with small brass lanterns, each swinging off an individual pole. No expense has been spared to keep those who travel this road safe from the hoodlums that relish the darkness.  A street lantern and some charred foliage are here.

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.   A flowing white marble fountain, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a marble statue of a Human, a carved marble statue of a Dragon, a rosewood sign, an open patched spidersilk sack, and a wooden sword are here.

[Town Square Center.]

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.   A flowing white marble fountain, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a marble statue of a Human, a carved marble statue of a Dragon, a rosewood sign, and a wooden sword are here.
