The boughs of a large apple tree hang over the well tended avenue. Below the beautiful tree stands a small fountain. Atop the fountain is an intricately carved Secian who appears to be dancing with the water as it splashes around her. Set in the marble base is a small plaque that reads, "For those who have gone before us." Many stand for a moment as they pass this way, giving thanks for the gift of life that is given by both the apple tree and the Secians of long ago. Large piles of dirt and broken stone lay on either side of the street as workmen ready the east and west alleys for expansion.  A street lantern and a Secian etched moonsilver door are here.

[Southern Avenue.]

Vast estates tower over the huge Spurian wall towards the south. The well-to-do who live in these homes idle away their days, enjoying the luxury of time. Standing next to a very empty lantern pole, a small Flerian child insists in a plaintive wail, that he had nothing to do with the missing lantern. The well-dressed guard that interrogates him keeps pointing at a small sack on the ground and its obvious contents.  An open small burlap sack and a street lantern are here.

The outward appearance of the people here seems a bit classier. Rich clothing and large coin purses are prevalent amongst the travelers. In fact, many of the folk heading into Town Square from the south are accompanied by large bodyguards to assure their safety. The well maintained road is lined with small brass lanterns, each swinging off an individual pole. No expense has been spared to keep those who travel this road safe from the hoodlums that relish the darkness.  A street lantern is here.

People carrying bundles stream in from the west and rapidly lose themselves in the large crowds moving about in the vast town square.

Giggling children dart around the slower moving folks rushing on their way to spend the silvers in their pockets.  A street lantern is here.

[Town Square Center.]

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.   A flowing white marble fountain, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a cracked marble statue of a Human, a carved marble statue of a Dragon, a rosewood sign, some flaming ruby ashes, and a deep fluffy snow drift are here.

The elegant Hotel Royale towers above the street, its emerald door sparkling in the light. The patrons that stroll in and out are catered to, doors opened and closed for them, and baggage and packages carried by harried servants. The large Bank of Spur sits on the east side of the square. Its location close to the Royale is not a coincidence. A gold-trimmed door is proof of the success of this branch of the Spurian bank and those who run it.  An elegant gold-trimmed walnut door, open emerald steel door, and a street lantern are here.

[Town Square.]

The elegant Hotel Royale towers above the street, its emerald door sparkling in the light. The patrons that stroll in and out are catered to, doors opened and closed for them, and baggage and packages carried by harried servants. The large Bank of Spur sits on the east side of the square. Its location close to the Royale is not a coincidence. A gold-trimmed door is proof of the success of this branch of the Spurian bank and those who run it.  An elegant gold-trimmed walnut door, open emerald steel door, and a street lantern are here.

[Town Square South.]

The outward appearance of the people here seems a bit classier. Rich clothing and large coin purses are prevalent amongst the travelers. In fact, many of the folk heading into Town Square from the south are accompanied by large bodyguards to assure their safety. The well maintained road is lined with small brass lanterns, each swinging off an individual pole. No expense has been spared to keep those who travel this road safe from the hoodlums that relish the darkness.  A street lantern is here.

Commercial buildings flank Town Square to the west and south of this corner. Imposing buildings stand stiffly to your west, while those to the south have a slightly seedy look about them.

Before you stands a magnificent white marble temple dedicated to Odarous, the god of chivalry. Ten giant steps made of the same gleaming marble lead up to the temple entrance. Two large statues stand at the base of the stairs, also carved of breath-taking marble. One is a warrior bearing a massive sword and a large shield. The other is a cleric with an amulet bearing the mark of Odarous in one hand and a large mace in the other.

Knowledge Path heads out of the bustling Town Square and moves southwest towards the District of Magick and Rehas Way.

A massive circular stone platform stands to the side of Magick Lane, strangely entrancing runes carved on every inch of its sides. The symbol of the god Sa, a golden Dragon, fills the space along the top. Raw power and magick seem to flow from the platform, making the air around it crackle with energy. A small sign stands next to the platform with a single word written upon it.  A rune covered platform, a SIGN, and a street lantern are here.

A low slung building resides on the west side of the street. Chanting can be heard from within.

A small sign hangs from above the door of the well-kept store before you, telling you that it is a rune shop. The occasional bright flash of light from inside the store suggests all kinds of strange and rare magicks are being cast inside! Those who walk past you glance at the rune shop warily and hurry to get past it as quickly as possible. A small sign hangs from the doorknob of the store that reads "Flerians not allowed!"

Incredible images cover every free corner of this small store, pictures of every possible rune available for purchase hang from the ceiling, on the walls and some even sit on the floor. Drawn onto scrolls, carved into the wood finish of the building or crafted from any number of other materials, each of the different runes has its own strange feeling of excitement to it. The shop owner looks to know what every one of the runes does.  A large glowing sign, a wooden sign, an intricately carved oak door, and some flaming ruby ashes are here.

[Ragarn's Runes.]

Incredible images cover every free corner of this small store, pictures of every possible rune available for purchase hang from the ceiling, on the walls and some even sit on the floor. Drawn onto scrolls, carved into the wood finish of the building or crafted from any number of other materials, each of the different runes has its own strange feeling of excitement to it. The shop owner looks to know what every one of the runes does.  A large glowing sign, a wooden sign, an intricately carved oak door, and some flaming ruby ashes are here.

This room is illuminated.
You see the 1st sleek black herding dog (wearing a small gold collar), the 1st wolf (wearing a small gold collar), and the 1st ferret (wearing a small gold collar).

[Saldaean rune library]

A wise old mage smiles and invites you in. A sudden feeling of warmth and power surrounds you as you enter. Shelves of ancient books and relics line the walls. Never before have you seen such a rare collection of magickal items. Runes begin to dance above the head of your host as he removes a book from the shelf and begins to read. If you ever needed new runes, this would surely be the place to get them.  An open sturdy birch door is here.

Within the heart of this proud fort one can see all around that the reconstruction of its buildings has begun. Large stones and logs have been stacked and piled, while some workers tirelessly attempt to repair the damage that occurred here during the Lords of Chaos wars. The buildings and homes of the people that resided here are slowly taking shape, though, far from completed. The smell of dyes, used to paint the town, permeate the area.  A breathtaking shimmering bouquet of moonflowers, an open light blue door, and a glowing wrought iron street lantern are here.

New wooden planks fit side by side creating the walkway that extends proudly upon the reconstructed supports. The view of the forest to the northwest is quite panoramic, despite the burnt spikes of trees in the midst. A staircase here seems to have some enchantment, judging by the strange appearance of unicorns, bears and owls on the lower steps. Strange, due to the fact that they don't appear carved, painted, or put there by any hand-made means. It is as if the glyphs grew into the wood itself. Mysterious symbols are scattered throughout the portraits, which shimmer with a golden whisper as they are approached.

Finely carved oak filigree lines the top edges of the oaken beams that serve as railing for the wooden bridge. Carvings of young firian maidens stand upon the the ends of the handrails, decorating the walkway that spans the platforms between the Northern Tree and Mother Tree. The view of the surrounding forest is breathtaking.

Swollen beyond its banks, the once small creek is now a rushing overflowing river. What used to be the charred footbridge is now a safe haven for fish well down river, nothing left of its structure. Set well into the bank of the river is a long steel pole. Lashed to the pole is a heavy rope. The voice of the riverboat captain can be heard echoing across the water, taking command and moving his cargo.  A flowing river, a freshly painted sign, some carved oak benches, and a riverboat are here.

The footbridge that once connected this path to its match on the other side of the overflowing rushing river is now nothing more then a few charred pilings. Tiny insects buzz around their remains, finding a comfortable new home. Lashed to the remains of one of the more sturdy pilings is a tall steel pole. Wrapped around the pole, and tied securely is a taut rope. Bobbing ever so lightly due to the strain of the riverboat, the rope holds tight.

A small orb of light hovers in the center of the path before you, only to disappear as you near it, reappearing further away into the swamp. Stepping near the orb to investigate closer only causes it to again blink out of existence, forming once more, deeper into the mists. It soon becomes apparent that the mysterious lights are attempting to slyly lead you into the swamp. To or for what purpose, is the question.

Ravens dark as pitch spread their feathers to a wing-span of nearly four feet, so large they are, as they quarrel over an abandoned mule carcass on the roadside breaks out. How final death seems, so casually nature simply encompasses the bodies of the fallen, through carrion hunters or moldy decay. Yet through death there be life again, any number of these ravens being sustained through this death, so they may live. Perhaps only to become sustenance for one of the swamp creatures, who, in turn, spends its life continuing the cycle.

The dried trees encroach even up to the roadside, here, their limbs reaching down to the passage as if to snatch the unwary passer-by. A sudden shift in the wind brings forth the sullied aroma of death and decay from the swamp southern lands. Slurpish noises belie the path of some creature traveling through the muddy scape, their movements hidden behind the smoky mist that reduces visibility to a mere few feet past the swamp's edge.

The open plains are becoming scattered with scraggly trees, the wood of which proving inefficient to use for building as the elements of nature have grown the trunks so twisted and hard in order to withstand the onslaughts of time. Circling around the northern base of a small hill, there lies the lapping edge of the swamp to the south. Small slimy creatures lie on the smooth stones near the water, darting into it at the speed of light as you near them with tiny splashes and echoing wakes blending into the small, gentle waves coming into the shore. Swarms of mosquitoes move along the land in unison, lending them the appearance of large, unified bodies hovering around for the next feast.

A hedge of spiky brambles forms a natural division from the lands and the swampy terrain to the south. Tall, limbless trees dot the horizon there, their bases lost in the misty depths of the gases hovering over the waters. Now and then a strange, growling sound echos up to the north, or an odd, high-pitched call of some unseen crow, probably feasting on a fallen creature hidden in the mists. The path curves away from the sounds, as popular choice has preferred to travel around the edges, rather than through the marshy sludge.

                                    Visualization #1 is:
The white paving stones give way to a boardwalk made of wooden planks.  The wood doesn't appear to be of Spurian make, and looks a great deal older, but very sturdy.

                                    Visualization #2 is:
Four sturdy walls and a roof of woven branches enclose this small tavern. From the forest floor, winding their way around the trunk of the Mother Tree, a set of intricately railed steps serve as the entrance and exit of the town of Treehaven. Strangers arriving at the top of the steps find themselves under the watchful eye of patrons seated at tables positioned about the light, airy room. A set of oak steps lead up to the new Council chambers.

                                    Visualization #3 is:
An abundant gallery of paintings depicting sacrifices and hold offerings to their god suspend from crooked iron nails. Resting beside each painting, cold black iron braziers appear to hold burned blood and bone. A few charred, blackened pieces can be found in them. Several iron chains hang along the walls of the sacrificial chamber. Along the floor, intricately placed colored slate tiles are coated in dust covered dried blood. Centering the room is a raised platform accessible through a flight of stairs. Upon this raised formation rests an altar inlaid with rows and rows of teeth.

[Central Plaza Square.]

A beautiful crystal fountain, topped with the statue of King Rathanus the First, resides at the center of the plaza square. Water sprays from the king's open mouth and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular marble tiled pool. The fountain, a tribute to the founding ruler of Rathan, symbolizes Rathanus granting the breath of life to the once barren mountain side. Luminous crystal street lanterns, gilded marble benches, and delicately pruned rose bushes surround the perimeter of the square. Located at the very heart of the city, the plaza serves as a focal point for both business and casual interactions.  A large glistening silver crystal fountain, some silver gilded marble benches, and some blooming silvery bushes of Rathene roses are here.

A group of traveling buskers have set up a small stage at the southern end of the plaza. The odd looking trio is made up of a tiny Human child playing a tambourine, a beautiful Fir Elf maiden playing a lute, and a Human man, with the largest nose you have ever seen, playing the fiddle. Breathtaking music, the likes of which you have never heard, fills the air as the trio dances around the stage. Groups of townsfolk applaud and toss silver coins into the large bucket at the base of the stage.  An open gilded silver gate is here.

Stately homes, with manicured lawns and ivy covered fences, rise along both sides of the road. The traffic upon the road is mostly made up of glittering silver horse drawn carriages, patrols of royal guards, and the occasional rickety farmer's wagon. The carriages pull into the entrances of expensive looking homes and depart as quickly as they came, carrying wealthy noblemen off to various locales around the city.  Some large wooden and stone houses, an ivy-covered wrought iron fence, and some wild Rathene roses are here.

A luxurious pine log building stands at the corner of Rathanus Road and Treewort Avenue. Colorful stained glass windows and ivy-covered balconies grace the exterior of the elegant structure. An ornate silver sign hangs above the entrance engraved with the image of a mug imposed over the outline of a mountain. Upon the sign are words etched in a flowing script which read, "The Silver Mountain Inn". Pleasant music and laughter originate from within.  A pair of closed artfully carved oak doors are here.

A small, chilly-looking stream rushes briskly down the rocky terrain, and an ancient stone bridge provides passage across it. The bridge itself has been slightly eroded by time, but its demonic features are still quite visible. The pleasant moonflowers that bloom at its base provide a stark contrast to the bridge's sinister appeal.  An ancient demon-headed stone bridge, a flowing pale blue stream, and some glowing silvery moonflowers are here.

The silver paved road continues its course along the mountain slope where it meets a small cobblestone trail. The trail of silver and beige stones branches off toward the east and west, winding its way around the Silver Mountain's lower rim. Tall evergreen trees and colorful wildflowers cover the surface of the rocky southern slope.  Some giant evergreen trees, a bunch of crimson daffodils, and a bunch of amber daffodils are here.

[City of Rathan, Main Gate.]

A wide silver paved road begins at the city's main gate and ascends toward the heart of Rathan. The scenic view of the city from this point is truly captivating. A multitude of silvery roofed buildings, surrounded by tall evergreen trees, rise along the Silver Mountain's southern slope. Far to the north, the snowcapped peak of the Silver Mountain rises above the glimmering crystal dome of the Rathene Royal Palace. City guards, merchants, and townsfolk continuously pass through the gate set in the outer wall to the south.  A giant carved granite wall, an open giant silver gate, and some glowing silvery moonflowers are here.

[Entry Passage.]

The open passageway serves as a buffer between the inner and outer gates of the city of Rathan. Giant stone towers, connected by wooden walkways overhead, stand to each side of the passage. Silvery clad archers patrol the ramparts above. In times of emergency the city's gates can be closed simultaneously to entrap invaders.

An immense granite wall looms at the edge of the Demon Slope Road. Huge towers have been masterfully carved into the stone surface and stand to each side of a massive gateway. Beyond the gate lies the great city of Rathan, whose silver rooftops rise beyond the wall and  continue upward along the Silver Mountain's southern slope. Dove emblazoned purple standards adorn the faces of the towers and silvery clad guards patrol the upper ramparts.

Only the hardiest of life forms hold their own on the rocky steppes. Small cascades of icy water stream down the boulders and darken their surfaces. Tough lichen and scrub pines absorb nutrients from the mineral laden run-off. The sun shines brightly on the southern exposure of the trail, sheltered from the wind and freezing cold. Bright green oases of life sprout from rocky niches and the path is slippery where the green slimy growths cross it.

Huge boulders have created a bowl shaped depression in this sheltered hillock. A stand of scruffy trees continues to eke out a tenuous existence above the rocky outpost; their long tortured roots clinging desperately to what little soil is caught between the boulders. Prevailing winds from the mountaintop have caused the trunks to lean westward, the upper branches creating a canopy over the area.

Beneath the trees, many a caravan has stopped to water their draft animals and rest for the night. The area is strewn with animal refuse, bits of feed, and the resulting lingering aroma. The discarded feed and rubbish left by the travelers is picked over constantly by the hillock's inhabitants. In such a harsh environment, very little waste is left by the local scavengers.

The flow of the spring must be constantly replenishing the pool, for no algae or slime clouds its depths.  A small crystal clear pool is here.

A lean-to built from odds and ends serves as a way station for exhausted travelers. Gathered firewood lines the lean-to's walls, and a small darkened pit smolders outside the opening. Inside the small, cramped lean-to, light filters in through the makeshift construction. The possibility of being snowed in and sheltering for a long period in this little hovel is not a welcome proposition.

The walls of the tunnel bear witness to the constant pressures of the tons of stone above. Water seeps through large fractures to a small pool. Small piles of rocks litter the floor and the air is heavy with moisture. Footsteps produce a crunching rhythm, out of sync with one's quickening heartbeat.

Old rusted sconces stand sentry along both sides of this end of the giant tunnel. While time has marred the surface of the tunnel walls with minute cracks, the absolute precision and remarkable smoothness of the carved rock are still very impressive. Fresh, cool air blows in from outside.  An exit is here.

A lavish garden stretches between a rocky cliff to the west and a dark keep to the east. The flowers and shrubbery are immaculate, but the landscape is strangely quiet and completely devoid of movement. The lively, vibrant colors of the blossoms contrast with the deathly stillness. A large tunnel descends into the depths of the cliff-face.

An incredibly large keep looms ominously above the perfectly groomed grounds, its windows dark. The gate is carved with strange, deeply etched symbols that seem to swirl and writhe. There is no sign of life, no guard, not even a lowly footman to receive visitors...only more interminable silence.  An open old black obsidian gate is here.

Stepping stones cut across what was once a large lawn. Their destination is the rather imposing manse to the north. Weeds have choked out any grass that may have at one time existed. A cold breeze drifts across the area, even the most stoic can feel the goose bumps rising on their arms.  An open old black obsidian gate is here.

A finely crafted staircase, its balustrade polished from many years of use, rises to the second floor unsupported.

Heading off the main hallway is a smaller, less elaborate, branch. The marble flooring continues both directions, but it is plain to see that while no expense was spared in the main hallway, the small western hallway is stark in comparison. Two gold brocade chairs rest against the eastern wall, a small oak table sits between them. Bumping up against either chair will get you a mouthful of choking dust.

Stepping inside one of the cramped cells offers a perspective few wish to retain. Black iron manacles, hanging from chains imbedded in the walls, clank against each other hauntingly. The heavy, metallic smell of blood permeates the cell. Any view that might had been offered by the window has been squelched by the boards nailed over it.   A short iron frying pan and a closed antique iron chest are here.

This area is illuminated.
You see the 1st wolf (wearing a small gold collar) and the 1st ferret (wearing a small gold collar).

The floor stands agape here; a large hole resulting from the cedar floor boards being ripped up. Not far from the destruction is a collection of newly constructed heartwood coffins, their outer hulls inscribed with arcane and runic symbols. The closest container sits slightly ajar, offering the curious explorer a look within...   A cold stone staircase is here.

This tower floor is subdivided into many cramped cells. Opposite the larger cells, small three-foot cages are stacked on top of each other, their locks long since rusted away. The cedar heartwood planks under the nearest cage door bear many deep scratch marks, a futile attempt to escape the prison.   A cold stone staircase is here.

Concentric circles of fire-blackened stone form an eerie pattern on the floor beneath a suspended platform. The platform, hanging haphazardly by pulleys from only two of its four corners, is crafted from loose sheets of ring mail. Each ring is large enough to allow your finger to pass through, as well as the searing heat of the fire. The ring mail still holds strands of hair and rotting scales.  A cold stone staircase is here.

A green veined marble chair occupies the center position in this portion of the tower. The armrests contain thick leather straps, obviously designed for holding the occupant of the chair in place securely, and sharp spikes where the wrists would rest. Similar restraints are found where the legs would be, and a larger leather binding hangs where a head would be positioned. Directly under the armrests hang rusted copper buckets.  A cold spiraling stone staircase and a large faceted amber charm are here.

Small knobs adorn the wall on either side of the circular staircase. Upon further inspection, these knobs are actually small ebony hands, palms up and fingers slightly curved into a grasping position.

Small knobs adorn the wall on either side of the circular staircase. Upon further inspection, these knobs are actually small ebony hands, palms up and fingers slightly curved into a grasping position. The minute appendages line the walls high and low, some still holding long iron pokers and malleable steel paddles, others serving as hooks for three-pronged barbed whips.  A cold spiraling stone staircase and a short iron frying pan are here.

This area is illuminated.
You see the 1st spectral sanene inquisitor, the 1st wolf (wearing a small gold collar), and the 1st ferret (wearing a small gold collar).
In the area are Caylith the Drake (lying down), Equality the Noble Secian, Raptorian the Noble Secian, Nyoko the Drake, Forsythia the Drake, Jiedos the Secian (a ferret upon his left shoulder), Ceresina the Noble Secian, Twilight the Noble Secian (holding a glowing misty violet sapphire mages staff), Gwen the Secian, Binx the Secian (holding a flaming red and white phoenix feather), Everest the Noble Secian, and Dransillium the Draco.

Concentric circles of fire-blackened stone form an eerie pattern on the floor beneath a suspended platform. The platform, hanging haphazardly by pulleys from only two of its four corners, is crafted from loose sheets of ring mail.

A green veined marble chair occupies the center position in this portion of the tower. The armrests contain thick leather straps, obviously designed for holding the occupant of the chair in place securely, and sharp spikes where the wrists would rest. Similar restraints are found where the legs would be, and a larger leather binding hangs where a head would be positioned. Directly under the armrests hang rusted copper buckets.  A cold spiraling stone staircase, a bent tin earring, an open weathered pouch, a silver necklace, a large agate bead, some gold coins, some silver coins, an iron morningstar, a closed eagle embroidered suede belt pouch, and a small obsidian figurine are here.

Concentric circles of fire-blackened stone form an eerie pattern on the floor beneath a suspended platform.

Each ring is large enough to allow your finger to pass through, as well as the searing heat of the fire. The ring mail still holds strands of hair and rotting scales.

Stark white, unfinished walls line this hallway. A smooth carpet, worn over time and faded with age, lies on the floor. Several small, dirt caked windows line the barren wall. Through them you can see an abundant growth of vines snaking their way up the side of the tower.  A broken pine door is here.

In this smaller hallway the black marble floor continues on. The walls having never been finished are made of stone block. A slight chill pervades this portion of the hallway. Two doors stand face to face on both the northern and southern walls. They are made of a simple pine, and not finished.  An open pine door and a broken pine door are here.

Heading off the main hallway is a smaller, less elaborate, branch. The marble flooring continues both directions, but it is plain to see that while no expense was spared in the main hallway, the small western hallway is stark in comparison. Two gold brocade chairs rest against the eastern wall, a small oak table sits between them. Bumping up against either chair will get you a mouthful of choking dust.

A black velvet settee reclines against the wall below beautiful lead-paned windows framed with gold and black velvet drapes.  A polished oak staircase is here.

Entering the foyer the first thing you notice is its subtle opulence. The floor is highly polished black marble, the walls are covered with a gold stripped, cream colored paper. Light filters in through a large paned glass window which, at one time must have glistened, but is now coated with the accumulation of years of dirt. A finely crafted staircase, its balustrade polished from many years of use, rises to the second floor unsupported.  A polished oak circular staircase and some open massive black obsidian double doors are here.

Worn boards of the porch creek against your weight. Two massive obsidian front doors stand before you. A tarnished brass knocker, in the shape of a demon head, glares down.

Stepping stones cut across what was once a large lawn. Their destination is the rather imposing manse to the north. Weeds have choked out any grass that may have at one time existed.

Entering the foyer the first thing you notice is its subtle opulence. The floor is highly polished black marble, the walls are covered with a gold stripped, cream colored paper. Light filters in through a large paned glass window which, at one time must have glistened, but is now coated with the accumulation of years of dirt. A finely crafted staircase, its balustrade polished from many years of use, rises to the second floor unsupported.  A polished oak circular staircase and some open massive black obsidian double doors are here.

Heading off the main hallway is a smaller, less elaborate, branch. The marble flooring continues both directions, but it is plain to see that while no expense was spared in the main hallway, the small western hallway is stark in comparison. Two gold brocade chairs rest against the eastern wall, a small oak table sits between them. Bumping up against either chair will get you a mouthful of choking dust.

The putrid odors of sweat, urine, and blood confront your sense of smell, threatening to overwhelm it, and each of your other senses. Cedar heartwood planks comprise the floor of the tower.

Concentric circles of fire-blackened stone form an eerie pattern on the floor beneath a suspended platform. The platform, hanging haphazardly by pulleys from only two of its four corners, is crafted from loose sheets of ring mail. Each ring is large enough to allow your finger to pass through, as well as the searing heat of the fire. The ring mail still holds strands of hair and rotting scales.

A green veined marble chair occupies the center position in this portion of the tower. The armrests contain thick leather straps, obviously designed for holding the occupant of the chair in place securely, and sharp spikes where the wrists would rest. Similar restraints are found where the legs would be, and a larger leather binding hangs where a head would be positioned. Directly under the armrests hang rusted copper buckets.  A cold spiraling stone staircase and an open sturdy pouch are here.

Small knobs adorn the wall on either side of the circular staircase.

The minute appendages line the walls high and low, some still holding long iron pokers and malleable steel paddles, others serving as hooks for three-pronged barbed whips.  A cold spiraling stone staircase, an iron horseshoe, a cotton tunic, a straw hat, a brilliant blue and white garland of flowers, a porcelain jug, and a small canteen are here.

[Tower, Ari'kian Keep.]

The putrid odors of sweat, urine, and blood confront your sense of smell, threatening to overwhelm it, and each of your other senses. Cedar heartwood planks comprise the floor of the tower. Time and moisture have caused the wood to warp and crack, making your passage somewhat hazardous.  A cold spiraling stone staircase, an open large cobblestone door, a tiger's eye encrusted bronze goblet, a starry yellow brocade evening gown, some bloody iron leg irons, an iron chainmail coif, and a closed filthy sack are here.

This area is illuminated.
You see the 1st wolf (wearing a small gold collar), the 1st ferret (wearing a small gold collar), and the 1st chain-rattling executioner.
In the area are Caylith the Drake, Equality the Noble Secian, Raptorian the Noble Secian, Nyoko the Drake, Forsythia the Drake, Jiedos the Secian (a ferret upon his left shoulder), Ceresina the Noble Secian, Binx the Secian (holding a flaming red and white phoenix feather), Everest the Noble Secian, and Dransillium the Draco.

Upon further inspection, these knobs are actually small ebony hands, palms up and fingers slightly curved into a grasping position.

A cold spiraling stone staircase is here.

No exit is visible from this section of the tunnel, only a choice of east or west. A few hastily assembled wooden beams seem to support entire weight of the mountain. It is a harrowing thought to consider how much rock hangs on a these few prudently placed support beams made of decaying wood.  Some rotting wooden beams are here.

While the tunnel is still well made and structurally sound, the air deep within is dank and moist. On closer inspection, hair-line fractures have appeared in the smoothly cut tunnel walls, allowing a few moist rivuletes to seep through onto the granite's surface. The walls are streaked dark from the constant flow of the cold, clear water.

A lean-to built from odds and ends serves as a way station for exhausted travelers. Gathered firewood lines the lean-to's walls, and a small darkened pit smolders outside the opening. Inside the small, cramped lean-to, light filters in through the makeshift construction. The possibility of being snowed in and sheltering for a long period in this little hovel is not a welcome proposition.

The boulders bear scars from deeply driven pinions and screws used to hold cables and reins, or perhaps impromptu corrals for the portage animals.

The flow of the spring must be constantly replenishing the pool, for no algae or slime clouds its depths.  A small crystal clear pool is here.

Beneath the trees, many a caravan has stopped to water their draft animals and rest for the night. The area is strewn with animal refuse, bits of feed, and the resulting lingering aroma.

Huge boulders have created a bowl shaped depression in this sheltered hillock. A stand of scruffy trees continues to eke out a tenuous existence above the rocky outpost; their long tortured roots clinging desperately to what little soil is caught between the boulders.

Only the hardiest of life forms hold their own on the rocky steppes. Small cascades of icy water stream down the boulders and darken their surfaces.

You follow Forsythia through a large pile of rocks...

[Tarath Gorge.]

The footing here seems a bit unstable. As you continue on your journey, you wonder what this land was like before the mining began. Something seems to glint in the sunlight on the northern horizon.  A large pile of rocks is here.

You follow Forsythia north...

[Tarath Gorge.]

Rough granite walls rise above you to the east and west. The area here is a bit rougher and seems to have been recently mined. Large veins of silver can be seen. Up overhead, on the western face of the gorge wall a large crack has appeared. Though large enough to fit a Thugian, the only thing exiting the crack is a steady stream of dripping water.

You follow Forsythia north...

[Tarath Gorge.]

The gorge seems just as large on both sides of you as it did when you first entered it. The sedimentary rock layers in the cliffsides dazzle you with the richness of their color. Looking closer, you see tracks running up to the gate of a massive fort.

Obvious paths: north* south*.

You follow Forsythia north...

[Fort Tarath.]

You stand before a granite wall and large double gated doors. The walls are thick and finely crafted, and there seems to be a rather aged look about them.  The Gate is made of massive slabs of silver, while off to the left and right are the fort's impressive walls, able to withstand a rather large invasion or army if need be.  An open silver-trimmed black drathain gate is here.

The wolf barks softly.

You follow Forsythia through an open silver-trimmed black drathain gate...

[Fort Tarath.]

The giant fortification wall is divided into two main sections by huge doors.  These doors have been made from silver and look as though they could stand even the most fearsome battering ram.  Guards standing atop the walls eye you closely.  To the north you can see the business district.  An open silver-trimmed black drathain gate is here.

Each corner of this square gives entrance to one of the fort's four business establishments. The bank is small, but adequate. The pawnshop and store will see to your buying and selling needs, and the Tarath Wayside Inn is open at all hours to provide shelter for residents and foreigners alike.

The blue glow fades from her hands.

You follow Forsythia through a pawnshop...

[Fort Tarath, Pawnshop.]

For a second-hand outpost store, this shop is kept in remarkably good condition.  Shelves, racks, and hooks line the walls, all filled with previously owned items.  Swords and shields hang from the ceiling, reflecting the lamplight across the floor.  An exit is here.

The giant fortification wall is divided into two main sections by huge doors.  These doors have been made from silver and look as though they could stand even the most fearsome battering ram.  Guards standing atop the walls eye you closely.  To the north you can see the business district.  An open silver-trimmed black drathain gate is here.

Rough granite walls rise above you to the east and west. The area here is a bit rougher and seems to have been recently mined. Large veins of silver can be seen. Up overhead, on the western face of the gorge wall a large crack has appeared. Though large enough to fit a Thugian, the only thing exiting the crack is a steady stream of dripping water.

Old trees lay side by side with the massive boulders of the mountain, intermingling in a terrible landslide. The mountain top has broken off and slid across the eastern road stopping all forms of transportation. It would take years for mortal hands to remove the tons of stone from the original roadway to make it passable once again. Thankfully, nature has changed the landscape for the better, and has opened a gap through the mountain to the north.

                                    Visualization #1 is:
The white paving stones give way to a boardwalk made of wooden planks.  The wood doesn't appear to be of Spurian make, and looks a great deal older, but very sturdy.

                                    Visualization #2 is:
Four sturdy walls and a roof of woven branches enclose this small tavern. From the forest floor, winding their way around the trunk of the Mother Tree, a set of intricately railed steps serve as the entrance and exit of the town of Treehaven. Strangers arriving at the top of the steps find themselves under the watchful eye of patrons seated at tables positioned about the light, airy room. A set of oak steps lead up to the new Council chambers.

                                    Visualization #3 is:
An abundant gallery of paintings depicting sacrifices and hold offerings to their god suspend from crooked iron nails. Resting beside each painting, cold black iron braziers appear to hold burned blood and bone. A few charred, blackened pieces can be found in them. Several iron chains hang along the walls of the sacrificial chamber. Along the floor, intricately placed colored slate tiles are coated in dust covered dried blood. Centering the room is a raised platform accessible through a flight of stairs. Upon this raised formation rests an altar inlaid with rows and rows of teeth.

To the southeast the road disappears into a dense patch of thorny brambles. A burned out cart lies battered in a ditch at the side of the road. The cart bears the markings of the city of Rathan as well as those of the Rathene merchants guild.

Thorny vines reach out across the path making travel difficult. The thicket has become so overgrown that it is nearly impassable in places. The ground is worn by the soles of countless feet, making the dense wall of bramble seem even more out of place.

Thick thorny brambles line the path, as a further reminder to travelers that straying from their heading may be unwise. The road looks poorly tended in places, most notably where the brambles have spread beyond its outer boundaries.

A muddy pool of water lies to the north, nothing can be seen below its murky surface. The smell of rotting flesh rises from the pool and is carried for a great distance by the wind. The skeletal remains of what was once a cow lies half submerged in the water, its carcass picked clean by scavengers.

Farm animals graze in the distance. Their vague forms barely visible as they lumber about the tall grass. To the north the flat grassland gives way to the rolling foothills of the Great Divide. The mountains themselves are nothing more than ghostly images fading in and out of view on the horizon.

To the southwest the ghostly outline of a forest can be seen darkening the area around it like a blight upon the land. Grassy plains stretch out to the west. Swarms of tiny insects hover just above the grass, in some places the swarms are so dense they take on the appearance of being a single entity.

A dark twisted forest lies to the west, breaking the tranquil feel of the grasslands. The trees that are visible are twisted and deformed, the ground is scorched and blackened. A heavy ground fog seeps from deep within the forest carrying with it the acrid smell of death.

A dark foreboding forest is visible far off to the west. No grass grows near the forest. The grasslands shrink away from the grove as if even the plant life is afraid of it. There is a barren area between where the grass ends and the trees begin, giving the forest the illusion of isolation.

The city of Spur looms on the eastern horizon, just beyond a wooded grove. A small path exits the grove and heads off to the northwest. The grass that lines the path ripples as a light breeze dances through its tall blades.

The path is flanked by countless tall oaks, swaying peacefully in the wind. They do their best to hide the sky from view, making it hard to tell night from day at times. Littering the area are pieces of broken wagon, bits of human remains and dried splotches of blood. The remnants of a violent fight lie all around you, whomever used to belong to the wagon is no more than vulture food.  A bloody severed foot is here.

[Oak Woods.]

Several maple trees, growing in a small cluster, stand out among the massive oaks that dominate this part of the wood. The wildlife is bustling with activity. Chipmunks scamper across the high branches, while a myriad of bird songs fills the air.  A red maple tree, a red maple tree, and a red maple tree are here.

The leaves on the maple trees wave lightly under a gentle breeze. Small birds call out bright songs filling the air with their happy sounds. Two tiny chipmunks poke their heads up from under a log then scamper off chasing each other.  A giant green oak tree and a golden oak tree are here.

[Spur Gateway.]

Travelers from Rathan to the northwest, and the Trade Route to the south, converge at Spur's west gate. Guards posted on the ground give those seeking to enter the city a cursory once-over. Their lack of interest shows that anyone approaching has already been observed from above for some time. A grate in the ground loosens mud from wagon wheels and hooves before they pass through the gate, helping to keep the streets of Spur fairly clean.  An open giant black iron gate, a giant green oak tree, a small blue pool, a thick oak grate over the pool, and a polished stone marker are here.

[Gateway.]

The relative safety inside Spur is a comfort to those returning from the fields and mountains. To those leaving, a massive wall of defense around the city lies ahead. Archer towers beside the gate overlook the wall, offering a painful welcome to would-be invaders. Several guards on foot patrol pass and disappear behind a thick, bluesteel banded steelwood door. Wall road stretches to the south, a wide passage between the city wall and several large buildings.  An open iron gate, an open thick stone door, and a street lantern are here.

[Trade Way.]

From the city gate to the west, Trade Way continues eastward towards the busy Merchant district, past Joyeusse's Shop. The air is thick with the scent of fresh flowers. Wagons filled with goods bound for sale trundle past, their drivers hopeful of the anticipated profits. Eager young warriors venture towards the west gate and the dangers beyond.  An open carved rosewood door and a street lantern are here.

Deep grey mists surround a strange pile of rubble that lies south of the road. Occasionally a priest clad in a simple grey robe will wander past the rubble and whisper a short prayer under his breath. The fence running around the rubble is well kept, but the gate which once allowed entrance to this Temple has been chained closed.  A grey iron chained gate, a pile of rubble, and a street lantern are here.

The throngs of travelers thicken as one heads east along Trade Way. An Anthian plays softly on a strange looking stringed instrument, her melodic voice filling the air. Judging by her clothing, and the number of silvers at her feet, she makes a fine living practicing her craft.  A street lantern is here.

[Trade & Market.]

The buildings of Market Circle stand to the south. It becomes obvious that the area through the arch is a much cleaner marketplace than the bazaar. An inviting eatery stands beside the road, its door open to those weary after a long trip to Spur, as well as those preparing to venture to the great expanses beyond the west gate. A human couple exit the building, arm in arm. A small sign stands beside the intersection.  A sign, an open glossy lacquered oak door, and a street lantern are here.

[Market Street.]

Situated between the well-traveled Trade Way to the north and the fine shops of Market Circle to the south, this small stretch of road is busy at all times of day. Adventurers with sacks of plundered goods leave Market Street and head west. A shrewd businessman has set up shop in this busy area of the Market District.  A street lantern is here.

[Market Circle.]

An arch between two large buildings connects Market Circle and Market Street. The more reputable shopkeepers do business within the circle, but pay higher taxes for the privilege. The buildings have been built to last, as these merchants are no traveling tinkers. Interlocking stone walkways and colorful plantings span this central area. Despite the number of animals waiting outside the bank for their owners, the area is spotless. Loud chatter in many languages can be heard from the southwest.  A marble archway, an open elegant gold-trimmed walnut door, and a wooden sign are here.
