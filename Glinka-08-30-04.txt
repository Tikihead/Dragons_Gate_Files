A circle of tall, gray stones surrounds a vine-covered stump, as though protecting it from prying eyes.  Approaching the stump, you can almost feel it pulse with a hidden energy, as if it still has some life within it.  Markings decorate its top, although the overgrowth obscures most of it.  An overgrown path and a twisted black orchid are here.

This area is illuminated.
In the area are Verbaniah the Secian, Aradeia the Leuian, Nominus the Leuian, Autumn the Fir Elf, Julien the Noble Leuian, Orianna the Noble Anthian, and Gramliz the Hithual.
Obvious paths: None.

Nominus says, "Runemages, out of their basic lack of respect for and understanding of this world that has been created for us, developed runes to manipulate it for their own ends, recklessly removing the power inherent in all things"

Nominus says, "without even seeking permission from its Creator."

Nominus says, "They trap it within objects for their selfish purposes, heedless of the consequences of their theft and oblivious to the fact that by their actions they corrupt the power they've taken for their own. "


Orianna raises an eyebrow.

Autumn furrows her brow.

Carefully winding its way up the base of the tree, and wrapping itself around the stairs, a flowering jasmine vine grows tall and lush. Dark scars from a past fire are almost hidden under tufts of fresh growth and moss. A large gap, nearly sixteen feet in distance, rests between the base of a set of stairs and the forest floor. A long moonsilver cord hangs down the side of the tree. If one pulls it, the long Elven rope will descend from above, allowing them to enter the great city of Treehaven. Bright green leaves of clover have begun springing up through the ashy soil in conjunction with soft moss to lend a durable cushion to this well-traveled spot.  Some vine-covered steps circling the tree, a freshly painted wooden sign, a healthy green patch of clover, a flowing marble fountain, some clover shaped stones, some sweet scented flowering jasmine vines, a long woven moonsilver cord, and an Elven rope are here.

The latticework surrounding and covering the spiral staircase is finely crafted. The intertwining beams seem to weave a delicate pattern above you, accenting the view of the forest floor. Soft, new, growth can be seen all over the forest below. A small mound of moss has slowly begun to cover the old inn, creating a fuzzy green mound. A large pile of Elven rope sits near the silent Golem. This creature of Elindale helps defend the city by retrieving the rope that people have pushed down to the forest below.  Some steps circling the tree, a freshly carved wooden sign, and an Elven rope are here.

[Gaspar's Grog and Grub.]

Four sturdy walls and a roof of woven branches enclose this small tavern. From the forest floor, winding their way around the trunk of the Mother Tree, a set of intricately railed steps serve as the entrance and exit of the town of Treehaven. Strangers arriving at the top of the steps find themselves under the watchful eye of patrons seated at tables positioned about the light, airy room. A set of oak steps lead up to the new Council chambers.  An ivory inlaid pine bar, a wooden stool, a long weathered wooden bench, a long musty wooden table, some steps circling the tree, some freshly crafted oak steps, an open door, a paper covered posting board, and a gilt framed painting on the wall are here.

This room is illuminated.
In the room are Fionna the Noble Secian (seated), Julien the Noble Leuian, Verbaniah the Secian (holding a glowing delicate red crystal rose), Aradeia the Leuian, and Fenwhelt the Anthian (seated).
Obvious exits: None.

Fenwhelt asks Aradeia, "So what's this about no Runespheres in the temple?"

Fenwhelt ponders the meaning of the universe for a moment.

Fenwhelt says to Aradeia, "I'm thinking Arah."

Fenwhelt nods.

It looks like an open large dusty worn leather rucksack.

There appears to be something inside.

Aradeia says to Fenwhelt, "Just what it says..."

Aradeia says to Fenwhelt, "No Aech."

Fenwhelt says to Aradeia, "Well, I'm just curious as to why."

Julien gazes around the room.

Fenwhelt says to Aradeia, "Before I go trapsing through your temple, and upsetting more clergy."

Julien asks Fenwhelt, "Voices?"

Verbaniah, boingy, boingy, boingy, just went through an open door.

A number of glowing amber runes begin to dance above Fenwhelt's head.

An amber aura suddenly envelops Julien's head closely!

Aradeia says to Fenwhelt, "Well. Rune spheres are a deliberate energy-sucking thing. And they steal from the Lady."

Fenwhelt asks Aradeia, "Steal from the lady how?"

Tiamat just entered through an open door.

Tiamat just went through some steps circling the tree.

Aradeia says to Fenwhelt, "They take her power."

Fenwhelt says, "They're benign in their current form."

Fionna says to Glinka in Secian, "I donna thin I ever gonna gets bonded"

The amber glow about Julien's head fades away.

Aradeia says to Fenwhelt, "They are still a concentration of that Power, which weakens Her."

Fenwhelt says to Aradeia, "They're a concentration of magick."

Aradeia says to Fenwhelt, "Taken from nature, fenny. The spheres are an affront to her, and the healing ones take her power."

Xavier, hands crackling with black energy, just entered through an open door.

Julien is now cold.

Fenwhelt says to Aradeia, "If you say so."

Julien says to Xavier, "Xavier..."

Xavier raises an eyebrow at Julien.

Fionna's stomach growls.
