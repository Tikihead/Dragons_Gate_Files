Contrasting starkly with the ashes of the forest and brush is a freshly constructed set of stairs that wraps itself about the large tree. The intricate woodwork that decorates the steps is of the finest quality, as if in parody to the blackened destruction of the hedges and brambles around the base of the trunk. Bright green leaves of clover have begun springing up through the ashy soil in conjunction with soft moss to lend a durable cushion to this well-traveled spot.  Some steps circling the tree, a freshly painted wooden sign, a healthy green patch of clover, a flowing marble fountain, some clover shaped stones, and a large red wooden wagon are here.

The path of four leaf clove shaped flagstones leads past a small clean shack and into a well formed tunnel through the thorn bushes to the east and the Caersech to the west. The small shack is set back from the road, its walls built of a whitewashed birch. A sturdy corral, filled with well-fed horses, stands to the left of the shack. A matched pair of dapple grays stand in front of the shack waiting to take their human baggage to their destination. To the left of the door, behind a small paned window, a beautiful Fir Elf female takes coin and in return, with a charming smile, directs those who have paid their fare into the waiting room.

[Hope's Path.]

A number of darkened and burnt trunks still stand around the path. A few patches of undergrowth have started to spot the earth about, trying to cover the desolation. Small four-leaf-clover shaped stones form a small path through the darkened trunks. The soft sound of running water echoes in from the west.  A small winding stone path is here.

This area is illuminated.
In the area are Fyndalstadt the Psycian, Lilioth the Secian (flying beside you and holding a glowing luminous sun crystal), and Losmir the Draco.

[Caersech Forest.]

The dark ground crunches with a spotting of pine needles and brown leaves from the weight placed upon it. Wild grasses and a few flowers spot the still blackened land. To the north, a couple of saplings stretch from the ground, trying to replace their fallen ancestors.

[Caersech Forest.]

Cleared of the debris of the past fire, the spot harbors the blackened trunks of the rare maidenhair trees in the forest. Several patches of clover has sprung up around the base of a single, recently grown maidenhair tree.   A healthy green patch of clover and a tiny maidenhair tree are here.

A small, carefully planted sapling sits between the charred remains of two of the maidenhair trees that once shaded this part of the path. The thin grasses and weeds that poke from the dark ground have been cleared away from the roots of the sprouting tree. A small wooden block had been buried in front of the small tree.  A winding path is here.

[Treehaven, Glen.]

The thick sub-layer of the forests flora casts eerie shadows that move like a living force. The rich sound of flowing water nearby makes the birdcalls from the tall maidenhair trees that surround the path sound distant. A light breeze passes across the branches of the trees, swaying and moving them in a gentle dance.  A winding path is here.

The thick vegetation and the massive trees thin as one moves from the main path. A small clearing appears, a place where travelers can rest or camp overnight. A few markings on some nearby tree trunks tell the story of deer racks and bear claws being cleaned. Scampering across the path, a tiny, long-eared chipmunk holds an acorn in its teeth for future storage. Other than the sounds of his crunching, the clearing is quiet and peaceful.

The thick vegetation and the massive trees thin as one moves from the main path. A small clearing appears, a place where travelers can rest or camp overnight. A few markings on some nearby tree trunks tell the story of deer racks and bear claws being cleaned. Scampering across the path, a tiny, long-eared chipmunk holds an acorn in its teeth for future storage. Other than the sounds of his crunching, the clearing is quiet and peaceful.

The pungent, sylvan air of centuries condenses all around. The tall pines and ancient maidenhair trees have thick, strong trunks that have withstood season after season of natural and unnatural assaults. Strong roots grow in gnarled tangles, threatening to trip those that pass.

The roaring sound of the river overwhelms most other sounds as one travels along the rocky path that shadows its serpentine shape. A small chunk of wood swiftly passes, bobbing on the foamy rapids. Large, smooth rocks are piled near the riverbank, by an ancient flood. A deweybird hops among them, looking for some juicy waterbugs.  A closed old ivy-covered gate and a closed sapphire blue mailbox are here.

The thick sub-layer of the forests flora casts eerie shadows that move like a living force. The rich sound of flowing water nearby makes the birdcalls from the tall maidenhair trees that surround the path sound distant. A light breeze passes across the branches of the trees, swaying and moving them in a gentle dance.  A winding path is here.

A small, carefully planted sapling sits between the charred remains of two of the maidenhair trees that once shaded this part of the path. The thin grasses and weeds that poke from the dark ground have been cleared away from the roots of the sprouting tree. A small wooden block had been buried in front of the small tree.

>[Majestic Pine Lane, North.]

Set among the large pine trees are four small white bungalows. Each with a uniquely colored door. They are set in an "L" shape, two of them north of the road and two of them east, a mirror reflection of the bungalows to the south. In front of each home is a beautiful garden, created to reflect the personality of those who live within. A well manicured courtyard sits in front of the homes dotted with smaller pines and benches. Small rabbits hop along unmolested nibbling upon the lush grass.  A closed blue pine door, a closed tan pine door, a closed red pine door, and a closed white pine door are here.

This area is illuminated.

[Bungalow.]

Thick plank floors are covered with a beautiful white and gold rug. Set upon the rug is a large overstuffed golden sofa. Threads of what look like pure spun gold run vertically throughout the sofa catching even the tiniest of light and reflecting it out to the walls of the bungalow. Behind a white slatted divider is a large bed, its white downy comforter falling to the floor. Beneath a large picture window that looks over the courtyard is a small wooden table with two chairs, perfect for a meal with a view.  A closed gold-trimmed white walnut chest and an open white pine door are here.
