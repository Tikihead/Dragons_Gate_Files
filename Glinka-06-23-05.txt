The heavens' lights give the deep emerald blanket of leaves a soft shimmer like tiny gems that dangle from the gnarled branches of towering trees. The light crunching of the earth can be heard as small animals scurry quickly through the forest. Muddy paw prints trail off and disappear into the surrounding underbrush. A long white picket fence follows the gentle slope of the muddy hill. Children laugh and place bets as to whom can slide the farthest along the slick path.  A flaming long golden bamboo tiki torch and some long white pine picket fences are here.

Fragrant, ribbon tied roses, daisies and tulips are carefully placed along a long pine fence, which separates a beautiful grassy park from a tall muddy hill. Several granite benches are placed sporadically in the carefully manicured grass. A small pond resides in the center of the area, and many partake in its fresh water to take a quick bath and remove the mud from the hill above. A tall arch, carved with the likenesses of forest creatures, leads the way to the fun to be had on the muddy hill sloping upward towards the northwest. A tiny wagon rests next to the pond, its door open and inviting people inside the Goody Trinket's Shoppe.

The wind whistles faintly, pushing the almost stagnant thick warm air of the season. The air is a bit warmer here due to the large forge set within the wagon ahead.  A cheerful forester slides past you, singing the old Firian ballad, "White Unicorn of Eli'fae'ur Forest." Through the trees, children play hide and go seek, while young lovers disappear into the thick forest to retreat from the rest of the world. A wagon, painted in a variety of bright colors, stands beside the dirt path. Beside it, a makeshift stall houses a pair of black mares covered in colorful blankets, who munch on oats from feed bags.  A flaming long golden bamboo tiki torch and an open brightly painted wooden wagon door are here.

Flitting from flower to flower, tiger-striped butterflies dance and swirl through the rich air of the season. A small group of Secians sit beside the billowing ivory tent drinking from the trumpet-shaped flower of sweet honeysuckle. Gardens of vibrantly adorned flowers and trees encircle the small tent in a ring of snapdragons, tiger lilies, mimosa, and lilacs. Taunting, splashing and laughter erupts from inside the tent which sets at the southeast corner of the winding path.  A flaming long golden bamboo tiki torch, some black and orange spotted tigerlilies, a fuzzy yellow mimosa tree, an open soft ivory silk tent flap, a dainty glass unicorn figurine, and a honey flavored amber hard candy are here.

Flowery vines twist around the tree trunks and stretch themselves from one tree to the next.  Purple and yellow petals swirl lightly as a soft breeze blows through. Two of the smaller trees bend towards each other, their upper branches entwining and forming a natural arch.

Black and silver silk streamers, entwined in twists and swirls, hang all around this airy tent. Comfortable warm air radiates around you from slow burning vanilla scented candles resting on tall wrought iron posts. The golden light produced bounces off slow spinning crescent moon crystals hung upon thin silver thread from the cottage's ceiling. Their rainbow light sparkles as they cast prisms on the oak floor. A red velvet curtain leads into a smaller room set up for the travelling tattooist and hairstylist, while a beaded curtain leads into Broyce's work area.  Some flaming vanilla scented candles, some spinning crescent moon crystals, a deep red velvet curtain, a glimmering purple beaded curtain, an open ivy-covered rosewood cottage door, and a small diamond-encrusted sign are here.

Black and silver silk streamers, entwined in twists and swirls, hang all around this airy tent. Comfortable warm air radiates around you from slow burning vanilla scented candles resting on tall wrought iron posts. The golden light produced bounces off slow spinning crescent moon crystals hung upon thin silver thread from the cottage's ceiling. Their rainbow light sparkles as they cast prisms on the oak floor. A red velvet curtain leads into a smaller room set up for the travelling tattooist and hairstylist, while a beaded curtain leads into Broyce's work area.  Some flaming vanilla scented candles, some spinning crescent moon crystals, a deep red velvet curtain, a glimmering purple beaded curtain, an open ivy-covered rosewood cottage door, a small diamond-encrusted sign, and a fluffy blue pillow are here.

This room is illuminated.

Black and silver silk streamers, entwined in twists and swirls, hang all around this airy tent. Comfortable warm air radiates around you from slow burning vanilla scented candles resting on tall wrought iron posts. The golden light produced bounces off slow spinning crescent moon crystals hung upon thin silver thread from the cottage's ceiling. Their rainbow light sparkles as they cast prisms on the oak floor. A red velvet curtain leads into a smaller room set up for the travelling tattooist and hairstylist, while a beaded curtain leads into Broyce's work area.

Black and silver silk streamers, entwined in twists and swirls, hang all around this airy tent. Comfortable warm air radiates around you from slow burning vanilla scented candles resting on tall wrought iron posts. The golden light produced bounces off slow spinning crescent moon crystals hung upon thin silver thread from the cottage's ceiling. Their rainbow light sparkles as they cast prisms on the oak floor. A red velvet curtain leads into a smaller room set up for the travelling tattooist and hairstylist, while a beaded curtain leads into Broyce's work area.  Some flaming vanilla scented candles, some spinning crescent moon crystals, a deep red velvet curtain, a glimmering purple beaded curtain, an open ivy-covered rosewood cottage door, a small diamond-encrusted sign, and a fluffy blue pillow are here.
