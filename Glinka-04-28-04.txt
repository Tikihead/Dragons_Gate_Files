>[Deep Pit.]

At the bottom here, the air is cold and damp. You hear the faint sound of water dripping all around you and the painful whimpering of a couple dogs as they attempt to move with broken limbs. Roots meander above, woven into each other throughout the cavern; it's a wonder how you didn't get entangled in them. The light, barely visible through the entwined roots, casts some roots into view you might be able to reach. The only other light you see comes from a small crack in the wall. Etched into the walls around it are cave drawings of what looks to be directions through Treehaven. Large piles of rock and dirt lay along the outer edges of this circular pit.  Some dead dogs strewn about, some tangled roots hanging down, a grated sewage pipe, and some water trickling below are here.

[Hidden Mossy Grove.]

A dark cove opens up beneath the thick canopy of the forest. Mangled remains of brutally slaughtered creatures of all sorts lie scattered among the dirt. Blackened skulls encircle a large central bonfire where tribal clad Go-blin-als chant in an ancient dark tongue and dance around the flames in a ritual manner. Near the edge of the cove several footsteps, of various size, are embedded in the ground. A twine of bloody rope rests on top of them.  A flaming large blazing bonfire, a tattered black Skullz flag, a closed heavy bone grate covering a hole, a massive oak chaos tree in chains, a hidden moss covered trail, a giant deadly flesh-eating plant, a smoking chimney from the ground, a slippery moss slide, and some wild dogs are here.

[Forest Path]

This tiny grotto is little more than an indentation in a massive granite boulder. Fir trees on either side provide shelter from the elements, their strange, drooping tips arching overhead to close off access to the sun. Several foot prints scamper back and forth along the moss covered forest floor.  A dark hidden moss covered trail and a small winding stone path are here.

[Emjedah Trail]

The drooping firs form a huge canopy overhead. Huge tendrils of parasitic moss hang from their branches, creating a rather unsettling effect. Even in broad daylight it's dim in this verdant tunnel.

You follow Anghus southwest...

[Emjedah Trail]

The huge, ancient trees make the path meander a bit, but you're definitely angling northward. It was obviously easier to wind between the massive tree trunks than to attempt to cut a straight road through the forest.

This newly constructed bit of road winds ambitiously into the looming forestlands to the north. Although not terribly well defined, the road presents an intriguing alternative to your usual route.  A slightly hidden trail is here.

[Brambles.]

Struggling through the underbrush, you make your way down the small trail only to be brought up short by an impenetrable wall of brambles. Plump red berries hang from the small branches of the bushes, guarded by long, sharp thorns. On a low hanging branch overhead, a watchful owl stares at you with golden eyes.  A slightly hidden trail, an ethereal looking owl, and some fragrant red rose petals are here.

[Thicket.]

Winding through the trees, the path emerges from the dense foliage and continues northward. You begin to wonder if there is a way into the seemingly impenetrable western forest. A track, that looks to be one used by small animals, veers off to the side.

[Riverside.]

The footbridge that once connected this path to its match on the other side of the overflowing rushing river is now nothing more then a few charred pilings. Tiny insects buzz around their remains, finding a comfortable new home. Lashed to the remains of one of the more sturdy pilings is a tall steel pole. Wrapped around the pole, and tied securely is a taut rope. Bobbing ever so lightly due to the strain of the riverboat, the rope holds tight.  A flowing river, a freshly painted sign, and some carved oak benches are here.

The riverboat captain pushes the boat off the bank with a pole and begins to pull it across the river along a rope, all of a sudden the boat beneath you doesn't seem terribly safe.

[Riverboat.]

Lined with wooden seats, this slim oak boat looks to be able to carry its passengers relatively quickly to their destination. A sturdy rope is threaded through a steel eyelet that rises about two feet above the bow of the boat. The captain's muscles strain with each heave-ho on the rope, as the boat cleaves through the deep waters of the river. A thick mist circles about the river and the boat as it very slowly is pulled across the river.  A wooden railing and some gooey white bird droppings are here.

[Riverside.]

Swollen beyond its banks, the once small creek is now a rushing overflowing river. What used to be the charred footbridge is now a safe haven for fish well down river, nothing left of its structure. Set well into the bank of the river is a long steel pole. Lashed to the pole is a heavy rope. The voice of the riverboat captain can be heard echoing across the water, taking command and moving his cargo.  A flowing river, a freshly painted sign, some carved oak benches, and a large pool of mud are here.

[Forest Path.]

The path continues to the west through a mix of moss covered Fir and Alder trees. Looking toward the taller trees to the west, you realize that it's not the trees that are higher, it's the rising ground. For some reason, the hill makes you uneasy.  Some mossy Fir trees and some majestic Alder trees are here.

The path bends to the northwest and northeast here, skirting the foot of the hill. The stream bubbles along seemingly unaffected by the loathsome presence of the hill. Moss, lichen and ferns cover the ground, making for a soft bed, if you dared to sleep.  A clear mossy river and an ivy entwined wooden gazebo are here.

A small stream runs noisily under the two bridges spanning the ravine. A number of the brunt oaks still stand about, memorials to the forest this once was. A number of small saplings dot the ground between the black trunks. Between the stream bank and oaks, a small path of four-leaf-clover shaped stones weave a windy path through the forest.  A stone bridge, a wooden bridge, and a clump of wildgrass are here.

Heading upstream the pastoral beauty is captivating. The willows and wildflowers hold an enchantment of their own. Looking past the beauty, however, is a jarring sight. The rounded summit of the dark barrow is clearly visible across the stream. By the bank of the stream, white wicker tables and chairs form a circle around a temporary dance floor. Centerpieces of cascading wild roses and creeping ivy adorn each table. Two large rose bushes frame a small stage at the edge of the dance floor. Tiny wild roses form a border around the dance floor. A single wild Foliot rose blooms by the river bank. A huge stack of deadwood sits next to a bright campfire that snaps and crackles in the dark night. Hand sawn logs ring the campfire providing seats. A string of paper lanterns warmly glow around the campfire's edge.  A pink Foliot wild rose is here.

Near the stream's bank stands a marble font covered with vines of fragrant purple and white blossoms. A soft white glow emanates from the small ivory dove statue set into the center of the font's crystal basin. A cool, refreshing breeze wafts through the branches of the ancient willows, filling the area with a sense of peaceful tranquility.

A small, carefully planted sapling sits between the charred remains of two of the maidenhair trees that once shaded this part of the path. The thin grasses and weeds that poke from the dark ground have been cleared away from the roots of the sprouting tree. A small wooden block had been buried in front of the small tree.  A winding path is here.

Small wildflowers and large tufts of grass cover the ground around the well-worn path that winds across the forest floor. A number of young saplings sprout eagerly from the ground around the remains of a once tall maidenhair. Standing beside the path is the Merchant's Pavilion, nestled comfortably among the brush.  An open pine door, a large green silk tent, some colorful wild flowers, and a tiny delicate maidenhair sprout are here.

A fine haze of dust hovers over the remains of the Silver Owl Inn. Through the fallen timbers and memories of lives lost, one can see brilliant green sprouts reaching for sunlight. A tiny songbird perches on an old stick of furniture poking through the rubble, singing sweetly to herald new life and hope. A small winding path of stones placed in the shape of four leaf clovers winds itself through the forest.  A small winding stone pathway and a charred flowering steelwood tree are here.

The path of four leaf clove shaped flagstones leads past a small clean shack and into a well formed tunnel through the thorn bushes to the east and the Caersech to the west. The small shack is set back from the road, its walls built of a whitewashed birch. A sturdy corral, filled with well-fed horses, stands to the left of the shack. A matched pair of dapple grays stand in front of the shack waiting to take their human baggage to their destination. To the left of the door, behind a small paned window, a beautiful Fir Elf female takes coin and in return, with a charming smile, directs those who have paid their fare into the waiting room.  A small shack, a freshly painted sign, a notice of non-refund, and a small winding stone pathway are here.

Contrasting starkly with the ashes of the forest and brush is a freshly constructed set of stairs that wraps itself about the large tree. The intricate woodwork that decorates the steps is of the finest quality, as if in parody to the blackened destruction of the hedges and brambles around the base of the trunk. Bright green leaves of clover have begun springing up through the ashy soil in conjunction with soft moss to lend a durable cushion to this well-traveled spot.  Some steps circling the tree, a freshly painted wooden sign, a healthy green patch of clover, a flowing marble fountain, and some clover shaped stones are here.

Four sturdy walls and a roof of woven branches enclose this small tavern. From the forest floor, winding their way around the trunk of the Mother Tree, a set of intricately railed steps serve as the entrance and exit of the town of Treehaven. Strangers arriving at the top of the steps find themselves under the watchful eye of patrons seated at tables positioned about the light, airy room. A set of oak steps lead up to the new Council chambers.  An ivory inlaid pine bar, a wooden stool, a long weathered wooden bench, a long musty wooden table, some steps circling the tree, some freshly crafted oak steps, an open door, a paper covered posting board, and a gilt framed painting on the wall are here.

A staircase here seems to have some enchantment, judging by the strange appearance of unicorns, bears and owls on the lower steps. Strange, due to the fact that they don't appear carved, painted, or put there by any hand-made means. It is as if the glyphs grew into the wood itself.

A staircase here seems to have some enchantment, judging by the strange appearance of unicorns, bears and owls on the lower steps. Strange, due to the fact that they don't appear carved, painted, or put there by any hand-made means. It is as if the glyphs grew into the wood itself. Mysterious symbols are scattered throughout the portraits, which shimmer with a golden whisper as they are approached.

[Riverboat.]

Lined with wooden seats, this slim oak boat looks to be able to carry its passengers relatively quickly to their destination. A sturdy rope is threaded through a steel eyelet that rises about two feet above the bow of the boat. The captain's muscles strain with each heave-ho on the rope, as the boat cleaves through the deep waters of the river. A thick mist circles about the river and the boat as it very slowly is pulled across the river.  A wooden railing and some gooey white bird droppings are here.

[Riverside.]

The footbridge that once connected this path to its match on the other side of the overflowing rushing river is now nothing more then a few charred pilings. Tiny insects buzz around their remains, finding a comfortable new home. Lashed to the remains of one of the more sturdy pilings is a tall steel pole. Wrapped around the pole, and tied securely is a taut rope. Bobbing ever so lightly due to the strain of the riverboat, the rope holds tight.  A flowing river, a freshly painted sign, some carved oak benches, and a riverboat are here.

A slightly hidden trail, an ethereal looking owl, and some fragrant red rose petals are here.

[Hidden Mossy Grove.]

A dark cove opens up beneath the thick canopy of the forest. Mangled remains of brutally slaughtered creatures of all sorts lie scattered among the dirt. Blackened skulls encircle a large central bonfire where tribal clad Go-blin-als chant in an ancient dark tongue and dance around the flames in a ritual manner. Near the edge of the cove several footsteps, of various size, are embedded in the ground. A twine of bloody rope rests on top of them.  A flaming large blazing bonfire, a tattered black Skullz flag, a closed heavy bone grate covering a hole, a massive oak chaos tree in chains, a hidden moss covered trail, a giant deadly flesh-eating plant, a smoking chimney from the ground, and some wild dogs are here.

[Overgrown Path.]

The grass here grows thick and looms high over your head, making it difficult to keep direction. Insects swarm, taking advantage of your befuddled state, as you romp through what only a madman might call a path. Eventually you get to a point where walking any further through the dense grassland seems hopeless, when suddenly you stumble into an odd clearing. A large stone mass juts out of the ground here. Surrounding vegetation has withered away, shriveled and black in its decomposing death. Not so much as a stubborn weed attempts to take root. A cave leading into the depths of the outcropping has been blocked off by a grate where a pair of go-blin-al weilding long birch spears guard the entrance. Occasionally, sickly go-blin-als are left lying here.  A closed vine-covered bamboo grate is here.

[Shaman's Cavern.]

An eerie feeling pervades the air within the confines of the cavern walls. Wisps of smoke rise from bone carved flesh jack-o-lanterns, forming demonic images before slipping out through cracks in the earthen ceiling. Concentric blood-red circles have been etched into the ground, in the center of which dark summoning rituals are performed. An unusually pale go-blin-al writhes in pain awaiting treatment from the shaman. A faint cackling is heard from somewhere within the room, sending a shiver down your spine. Out of the corner of your eye you catch a glimpse of movement but turn only to find a painting on the wall.  An open vine-covered bamboo grate, a closed glass covered wooden ingredient rack, a closed bone etched ebony bookshelf, and an enchanted bone framed painting are here.

An eerie feeling pervades the air within the confines of the cavern walls. Wisps of smoke rise from bone carved flesh jack-o-lanterns, forming demonic images before slipping out through cracks in the earthen ceiling. Concentric blood-red circles have been etched into the ground, in the center of which dark summoning rituals are performed. An unusually pale go-blin-al writhes in pain awaiting treatment from the shaman. A faint cackling is heard from somewhere within the room, sending a shiver down your spine. Out of the corner of your eye you catch a glimpse of movement but turn only to find a painting on the wall.  A closed vine-covered bamboo grate, an open glass covered wooden ingredient rack, a closed bone etched ebony bookshelf, and an enchanted bone framed painting are here.

[Overgrown Path.]

The grass here grows thick and looms high over your head, making it difficult to keep direction. Insects swarm, taking advantage of your befuddled state, as you romp through what only a madman might call a path. Eventually you get to a point where walking any further through the dense grassland seems hopeless, when suddenly you stumble into an odd clearing. A large stone mass juts out of the ground here. Surrounding vegetation has withered away, shriveled and black in its decomposing death. Not so much as a stubborn weed attempts to take root. A cave leading into the depths of the outcropping has been blocked off by a grate where a pair of go-blin-al weilding long birch spears guard the entrance. Occasionally, sickly go-blin-als are left lying here.  An open vine-covered bamboo grate is here.

A dark cove opens up beneath the thick canopy of the forest. Mangled remains of brutally slaughtered creatures of all sorts lie scattered among the dirt. Blackened skulls encircle a large central bonfire where tribal clad Go-blin-als chant in an ancient dark tongue and dance around the flames in a ritual manner. Near the edge of the cove several footsteps, of various size, are embedded in the ground. A twine of bloody rope rests on top of them.  A flaming large blazing bonfire, a tattered black Skullz flag, a closed heavy bone grate covering a hole, a massive oak chaos tree in chains, a hidden moss covered trail, a giant deadly flesh-eating plant, a smoking chimney from the ground, and some wild dogs are here.

A dark cove opens up beneath the thick canopy of the forest. Mangled remains of brutally slaughtered creatures of all sorts lie scattered among the dirt. Blackened skulls encircle a large central bonfire where tribal clad Go-blin-als chant in an ancient dark tongue and dance around the flames in a ritual manner. Near the edge of the cove several footsteps, of various size, are embedded in the ground. A twine of bloody rope rests on top of them.  A flaming large blazing bonfire, a tattered black Skullz flag, a closed heavy bone grate covering a hole, a massive oak chaos tree in chains, a hidden moss covered trail, a giant deadly flesh-eating plant, a smoking chimney from the ground, a slippery moss slide, and some wild dogs are here.

Despite its small appearance from outside, this building is surprisingly spacious. Thick tree limbs run from the floor through the ceiling in places. Deadly imported Saldaean strangle vines creep in through circular windows, snaring those who dare venture too near in their lethal embrace. Several feeble attempts to board up windows have failed to stop the overbearing vegetation. The log walls of the chamber, marred with tribal paintings and offensive graffiti, are adorn with the stuffed heads of large creatures the pack has managed to bring down. Some lazy Go-blin-al lounge on random pieces of furniture scattered throughout the area.  A broken filthy torn ugly yellow couch, a dead Go-blin-al entangled in vines, a smelly cess pool, a crooked bamboo framed portrait, a giant bubbling brass stew pot, a rotting intestine swing, an open demonic snarling pig head mounted door, and a vine covered boarded up window are here.

Ravens dark as pitch spread their feathers to a wing-span of nearly four feet, so large they are, as they quarrel over an abandoned mule carcass on the roadside breaks out. How final death seems, so casually nature simply encompasses the bodies of the fallen, through carrion hunters or moldy decay. Yet through death there be life again, any number of these ravens being sustained through this death, so they may live. Perhaps only to become sustenance for one of the swamp creatures, who, in turn, spends its life continuing the cycle.

The open plains are becoming scattered with scraggly trees, the wood of which proving inefficient to use for building as the elements of nature have grown the trunks so twisted and hard in order to withstand the onslaughts of time. Circling around the northern base of a small hill, there lies the lapping edge of the swamp to the south. Small slimy creatures lie on the smooth stones near the water, darting into it at the speed of light as you near them with tiny splashes and echoing wakes blending into the small, gentle waves coming into the shore. Swarms of mosquitoes move along the land in unison, lending them the appearance of large, unified bodies hovering around for the next feast.

A hedge of spiky brambles forms a natural division from the lands and the swampy terrain to the south. Tall, limbless trees dot the horizon there, their bases lost in the misty depths of the gases hovering over the waters. Now and then a strange, growling sound echos up to the north, or an odd, high-pitched call of some unseen crow, probably feasting on a fallen creature hidden in the mists. The path curves away from the sounds, as popular choice has preferred to travel around the edges, rather than through the marshy sludge.

[Noble Way.]

Leaving the exceptionally wealthy estates of the Spurian nobility, Noble Way heads toward the Town Square to the northwest. Along the roadside can be seen the in-city homes of successful merchants and other wealthy citizens of the Spur. The homes display a slightly different style, perhaps they are not quite so restrained; a touch more exuberance and freedom with materials is displayed.  A street lantern is here.

Gazing down each of the nearby private drives reveals a glimpse of a luxurious home, each a miniature estate in its own right. Short, stout walls and manicured hedges serve to keep out the riffraff and to protect the small, expensive gardens. Every detail has been attended to display the exotic plants, in all their pampered perfection.  A street lantern and a closed rosewood door are here.

Noble Way continues to wind its way among the rather modestly sized, but elegant, homes of the Spur's successful. Many a peasant farmer may live in homes larger than these, but none can match the quality found here. A peaceful, luxurious feeling pervades this part of town; perhaps it is the drifting floral scents wafting from the well-tended gardens.  A closed elegant black iron gate and a street lantern are here.

Many grand, even ostentatious, homes line this stretch of Noble Way. Most of the residents here were fortunate enough to be born into the right families. Few that live in this area have ever actually had to work for a living. Glancing at the nameplates reveals many of the recognizable names of the Spur. Some of these names could almost be considered famous.  A street lantern is here.

An unusually large home, even for this part of town, lies off to the west. It seems as if one ambitious owner is slowly buying up the lots next to his and adding them to his own. Groundskeepers are at work in the surrounding gardens, trimming and raking, so intent on their work they do not bother to acknowledge the passing traffic on the road.  A street lantern is here.

To the north, you can make out an ornately scrolled gateway set in the base of the imposing city wall. The refined roadway of Noble Way stretches out to the south. The cobblestones of the road are smooth and even. The attention to detail shown here is a dramatic change from some of the other parts of the city.  A street lantern is here.

An elegant, carved wooden sign hangs above the ornate gateway set into the massive wall that divides Spurs Noble District from the Town Square. You can make out city guardsmen peering down attentively at all that approach from their posts atop the imposing wall. They seem to take a greater interest in this part of town, though there does not seem to be anything threatening enough here to warrant such attention.  A gilded silver plaque and a street lantern are here.

Standing next to the large iron gate that separates the center of town from those of the elite class are several of the Spurian Guard. They are here to assist all who pass with the simple kindness of opening a gate, or the more important task of escorting those in need to the bank or market. A young looking cadet rubs wax into the stones of the city wall, his task is daunting, but one that will teach him discipline.  An open iron gate and a street lantern are here.

[Southern Avenue & Gorey Street.]

The boughs of a large apple tree hang over the well tended avenue. Below the beautiful tree stands a small fountain. Atop the fountain is an intricately carved Secian who appears to be dancing with the water as it splashes around her. Set in the marble base is a small plaque that reads, "For those who have gone before us." Many stand for a moment as they pass this way, giving thanks for the gift of life that is given by both the apple tree and the Secians of long ago. Large piles of dirt and broken stone lay on either side of the street as workmen ready the east and west alleys for expansion.  A street lantern, a Secian etched moonsilver door, a pair of open silver forged swinging doors, and a sign above the doors are here.

Vast estates tower over the huge Spurian wall towards the south. The well-to-do who live in these homes idle away their days, enjoying the luxury of time. Standing next to a very empty lantern pole, a small Flerian child insists in a plaintive wail, that he had nothing to do with the missing lantern. The well-dressed guard that interrogates him keeps pointing at a small sack on the ground and its obvious contents.  An open small burlap sack and a street lantern are here.

The outward appearance of the people here seems a bit classier. Rich clothing and large coin purses are prevalent amongst the travelers. In fact, many of the folk heading into Town Square from the south are accompanied by large bodyguards to assure their safety. The well maintained road is lined with small brass lanterns, each swinging off an individual pole. No expense has been spared to keep those who travel this road safe from the hoodlums that relish the darkness.  A street lantern and some charred foliage are here.

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.   A flowing white marble fountain, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a marble statue of a Human, a carved marble statue of a Dragon, a rosewood sign, a small jagged cobblestone crack, a welcome mat, a giant crumbled maw, a massive black crack in the ground, and a stone tribal pendant are here.

Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.   A flowing white marble fountain, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a marble statue of a Human, a carved marble statue of a Dragon, a rosewood sign, a small jagged cobblestone crack, a welcome mat, a giant crumbled maw, a massive black crack in the ground, and a stone tribal pendant are here.

The elegant Hotel Royale towers above the street, its emerald door sparkling in the light. The patrons that stroll in and out are catered to, doors opened and closed for them, and baggage and packages carried by harried servants. The large Bank of Spur sits on the east side of the square. Its location close to the Royale is not a coincidence. A gold-trimmed door is proof of the success of this branch of the Spurian bank and those who run it.

Two tall pines stand sentinel on either side of the small white stone lane. A neatly manicured lawn rides up against a smooth stone wall on both the southern and northern property line.

[Merchant Walk.]

Merchants, some in frilly finery, others dressed in homespun wools, travel back and forth along this street on their way to and from work. They seem to blend together here, if only briefly. Several of the more haughty looking merchants are trailed by overloaded carts pushed along by haggard young apprentices.   A street lantern is here.

[Merchant Walk.]

A neatly kept park fronts this portion of Merchant Walk. Topiary and low shrubberies partition off small sections of the park. Young lovers sit on benches almost hidden from view, gazing at each other with looks of love, oblivious to the continual bustle of passing customers and merchants on their way to do business.  A street lantern is here.

[Merchant Walk.]

Neatly trimmed shrubbery line well-maintained cobblestones along Merchant Walk. Apprentices rush by carrying supplies and orders, carrying out their masters' business. Several wooden benches line the walk for those customers who need to rest from the strain of carrying heavy parcels.  A street lantern is here.

[Town Square West.]

People carrying bundles stream in from the west and rapidly lose themselves in the large crowds moving about in the vast town square. Several citizens head west with bulging coinpurses babbling excitedly about what they're going to purchase. Giggling children dart around the slower moving folks rushing on their way to spend the silvers in their pockets.  A street lantern is here.

[Town Square Center.]

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.   A flowing white marble fountain, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a marble statue of a Human, a carved marble statue of a Dragon, a rosewood sign, a small jagged cobblestone crack, a welcome mat, a giant crumbled maw, and a massive black crack in the ground are here.

This area is illuminated.

The elegant Hotel Royale towers above the street, its emerald door sparkling in the light. The patrons that stroll in and out are catered to, doors opened and closed for them, and baggage and packages carried by harried servants. The large Bank of Spur sits on the east side of the square. Its location close to the Royale is not a coincidence. A gold-trimmed door is proof of the success of this branch of the Spurian bank and those who run it.  An elegant gold-trimmed walnut door, open emerald steel door, and a street lantern are here.

A short entrance hall provides passage in and out of the exquisite Hotel Royale. A burly Thugian and a tall Monitanian carefully assess everyone as they enter. They prevent any pets from entering and keep out all but the quickest or sneakiest of the riffraff. A narrow passageway leads to the stables.  An open emerald steel door is here.
