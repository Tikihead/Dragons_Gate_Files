[Magick Festival, Trick Room.]

At first glance, the white and black marble tiled corridor extends for what seems eternity. A few steps proves that the room is actually wider than it is longer, and what should have been the ceiling is now the floor. A large top hat, large enough for one to walk though, lays on its side in the right hand corner of the room. Enormous, plush pillows in gold, black and white, are scattered along the ground, providing comfortable seating, if necessary.  An open runesilver handled glass door in the floor, a glowing hovering crystal ball, an open large lopsided top hat, a rune etched oak sign, and a long darkened corridor, light at end are here.

This area is illuminated.
In the area are Rhyanon the Elder Psycian Witch, Vixen the Noble San Elf, Soyam the Human, and Bant the Drake (lying down).
Obvious paths: None.

[King of the Hill Arena.]

Fragrant wildflowers and tall grass line both sides of a small trail here. Travel is difficult due to thick vegetation, which has grown out of control. As you look above the greenery, you see Gorgon Hill.  A large muddy portal and a glowing emerald sphere are here.

Rhyanon says, "You must offer the damsel to her."

                        -------------------------------------------

                                    Visualization #1 is:
A Temple. The Temple. Not surrounded by satellite buildings of faith, but part and parcel of the bustling city life. Archways and buttresses soar toward the heavens, creamy white marble reflecting all light.

                                    Visualization #2 is:
The elegant Hotel Royale towers above the street, its emerald door sparkling in the light. The patrons that stroll in and out are catered to, doors opened and closed for them, and baggage and packages carried by harried servants. The large Bank of Spur sits on the east side of the square. Its location close to the Royale is not a coincidence. A gold-trimmed door is proof of the success of this branch of the Spurian bank and those who run it.

                                    Visualization #3 is:
The latticework surrounding and covering the spiral staircase is finely crafted. The intertwining beams seem to weave a delicate pattern above you, accenting the view of the forest floor. Soft, new, growth can be seen all over the forest below. A small mound of moss has slowly begun to cover the old inn, creating a fuzzy green mound. A large pile of Elven rope sits near the silent Golem. This creature of Elindale helps defend the city by retrieving the rope that people have pushed down to the forest below.

[Festival of Magick, Levitating Disc.]

The platform on which you stand is made out of a thick glass, lending a distorted view of clouds and stars lazily passing beneath it. A powerful, softly humming force provides an unseen wall for safety of its passengers as the platform floats mysteriously upon the air. Within the bubble of energy, be it day or night, the air glows a combination of fiery reds and oranges against a darkened blue. Stars faintly glow and twinkle in the dusty light of both the sun and the moon.  A thick transparent glass platform, some glowing twinkling stars, a fiery sunset of varying hues, some floating glass steps, and some misty grey spiraling clouds heading down are here.

Through the gate lies the city of Spur, the major center of trade and civilization on the plains. The dusty road leading through the gates is well traveled, and walls of the city are in good repair. A small shack sits to the west of the road, during most times of the day a dusty coach can be seen waiting in front, its horses stomping with impatience to be gone. To the right of the door is a small window, its opening covered with metal bars. An old man, missing most of his teeth, waits patiently for the travelers to pay their fare, and then directs them into the waiting area. On the east side of the road a billowing multicolored tent has been erected, the hustle and bustle of merchants and customers can be seen coming and going at all times of the day.  A rainbow silk tent, a closed iron gate, and a fluffy white layer of snow are here.

The occasional locked gate marks the entrance to some of the more hidden estates of Spurs nobility. From this broad avenue, little can be seen of their splendor. Behind the imposing gate recedes a proud drive, disappearing mysteriously into the trees. If not for the large imposing tower rising above the hedges it would be hard to discern anything was beyond the gate. It is apparent the residents do not wish to be disturbed.  A street lantern, a closed morbius door, and an open black iron gate are here.

Majestic elms continue to line this broad roadway, sheltering the avenue on both sides and further enhancing the grandiose atmosphere.

The entire avenue is composed of fine cobblestone, each level with its neighbor, providing a smooth ride for passing carriages and horses.

Leaving the exceptionally wealthy estates of the Spurian nobility, Noble Way heads toward the Town Square to the northwest. Along the roadside can be seen the in-city homes of successful merchants and other wealthy citizens of the Spur.

Atop the fountain is an intricately carved Secian who appears to be dancing with the water as it splashes around her. Set in the marble base is a small plaque that reads, "For those who have gone before us." Many stand for a moment as they pass this way, giving thanks for the gift of life that is given by both the apple tree and the Secians of long ago. Large piles of dirt and broken stone lay on either side of the street as workmen ready the east and west alleys for expansion.  A street lantern, an open Secian etched moonsilver door, a pair of open silver forged swinging doors, and a sign above the doors are here.

Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.

Its location close to the Royale is not a coincidence. A gold-trimmed door is proof of the success of this branch of the Spurian bank and those who run it.  An elegant gold-trimmed walnut door, an open emerald steel door, a street lantern, and a new rosewood sign pointing southeast are here.

The outward appearance of the people here seems a bit classier. Rich clothing and large coin purses are prevalent amongst the travelers. In fact, many of the folk heading into Town Square from the south are accompanied by large bodyguards to assure their safety. The well maintained road is lined with small brass lanterns, each swinging off an individual pole.  A street lantern is here.

Vast estates tower over the huge Spurian wall towards the south. The well-to-do who live in these homes idle away their days, enjoying the luxury of time. Standing next to a very empty lantern pole, a small Flerian child insists in a plaintive wail, that he had nothing to do with the missing lantern. The well-dressed guard that interrogates him keeps pointing at a small sack on the ground and its obvious contents.  An open small burlap sack, a street lantern, and a lantern are here.

The boughs of a large apple tree hang over the well tended avenue. Below the beautiful tree stands a small fountain. Atop the fountain is an intricately carved Secian who appears to be dancing with the water as it splashes around her. Set in the marble base is a small plaque that reads, "For those who have gone before us." Many stand for a moment as they pass this way, giving thanks for the gift of life that is given by both the apple tree and the Secians of long ago. Large piles of dirt and broken stone lay on either side of the street as workmen ready the east and west alleys for expansion.  A street lantern, an open Secian etched moonsilver door, a pair of open silver forged swinging doors, and a sign above the doors are here.

An unusually large home, even for this part of town, lies off to the west. It seems as if one ambitious owner is slowly buying up the lots next to his and adding them to his own.

A small shack sits to the west of the road, during most times of the day a dusty coach can be seen waiting in front, its horses stomping with impatience to be gone. To the right of the door is a small window, its opening covered with metal bars. An old man, missing most of his teeth, waits patiently for the travelers to pay their fare, and then directs them into the waiting area. On the east side of the road a billowing multicolored tent has been erected, the hustle and bustle of merchants and customers can be seen coming and going at all times of the day.

An occasional rune plummets to the clouds that serve as the magickally structured walkway, illuminating the touched area and sending arcs of electricity between one ionic light to another. The clouds continually shift beneath you; the shapes always in a state of flux.  Some fluffy white clouds, some flaming flickering protection runes, a smoke and fire MAGICK ITEMS sign, and an open chest are here.

High above in the fiery sky - not quite night, not quite day - hang tiny flickering lights in the runic shape of protection. An occasional rune plummets to the clouds that serve as the magickally structured walkway, illuminating the touched area and sending arcs of electricity between one ionic light to another. The clouds continually shift beneath you; the shapes always in a state of flux.  Some fluffy white clouds, some flaming flickering protection runes, a smoke and fire MAGICK ITEMS sign, and an open chest are here.

The clouds beneath your feet give gently with each footstep, leaving ethereal impressions momentarily before fluffing back up. Above, the sky is alive with streaks of lightening that dance back and forth between more clouds and illuminate the orange-red sky with flashes of brilliant white.

[Magick Festival, Second Peddler's Area.]

High above in the fiery sky - not quite night, not quite day - hang tiny flickering lights in the runic shape of protection. An occasional rune plummets to the clouds that serve as the magickally structured walkway, illuminating the touched area and sending arcs of electricity between one ionic light to another. The clouds continually shift beneath you; the shapes always in a state of flux.  Some fluffy white clouds, some flaming flickering protection runes, a smoke and fire MAGICK ITEMS sign, and an open chest are here.

This area is illuminated.

An invisible shield rises and lowers as one steps between this room and the waiting area. Protection runes glow fiercely across the barrier, appearing and disappearing in the glass-like substance. A large, comfortable chair floats mid-air next to a crystal bucket filled with dyes, combs and shears.

High above in the fiery sky - not quite night, not quite day - hang tiny flickering lights in the runic shape of protection. An occasional rune plummets to the clouds that serve as the magickally structured walkway, illuminating the touched area and sending arcs of electricity between one ionic light to another. The clouds continually shift beneath you; the shapes always in a state of flux.  Some fluffy white clouds, some flaming flickering protection runes, a smoke and fire MAGICK ITEMS sign, and an open chest are here.

An ornate wrought iron fence, detailed with the various runes for each class, surrounds a raised platform in the center of the area; the runes glow and pulsate. The clouds beneath your feet give gently with each footstep, leaving ethereal impressions momentarily before fluffing back up. Above, the sky is alive with streaks of lightening that dance back and forth between more clouds and illuminate the orange-red sky with flashes of brilliant white. Misty letters swirl before you, shifting and melding together into sentences.  Some fluffy white clouds, some glowing dancing lightning streaks, some misty swirling words in the sky, a hovering oak door partially open, an open runesilver handled glass trapdoor, and some floating glass steps are here.

This area is illuminated.
You see the 1st brown speckled white gyrfalcon (wearing a small gold collar).

[Magick Festival, Second Peddler's Area.]

High above in the fiery sky - not quite night, not quite day - hang tiny flickering lights in the runic shape of protection. An occasional rune plummets to the clouds that serve as the magickally structured walkway, illuminating the touched area and sending arcs of electricity between one ionic light to another. The clouds continually shift beneath you; the shapes always in a state of flux.  Some fluffy white clouds, some flaming flickering protection runes, a smoke and fire MAGICK ITEMS sign, and an open chest are here.

[Magick Festival, Second Peddler's Area.]

High above in the fiery sky - not quite night, not quite day - hang tiny flickering lights in the runic shape of protection. An occasional rune plummets to the clouds that serve as the magickally structured walkway, illuminating the touched area and sending arcs of electricity between one ionic light to another. The clouds continually shift beneath you; the shapes always in a state of flux.  Some fluffy white clouds, some flaming flickering protection runes, a smoke and fire MAGICK ITEMS sign, an open chest, and an open rune-etched varnished oak chest are here.

[Magick Festival, Second Peddler's Area.]

High above in the fiery sky - not quite night, not quite day - hang tiny flickering lights in the runic shape of protection. An occasional rune plummets to the clouds that serve as the magickally structured walkway, illuminating the touched area and sending arcs of electricity between one ionic light to another. The clouds continually shift beneath you; the shapes always in a state of flux.  Some fluffy white clouds, some flaming flickering protection runes, a smoke and fire MAGICK ITEMS sign, and an open rune-etched varnished oak chest are here.

This area is illuminated.
You see the 1st young clouded leopard (wearing a small gold collar).

The platform on which you stand is made out of a thick glass, lending a distorted view of clouds and stars lazily passing beneath it. A powerful, softly humming force provides an unseen wall for safety of its passengers as the platform floats mysteriously upon the air. Within the bubble of energy, be it day or night, the air glows a combination of fiery reds and oranges against a darkened blue. Stars faintly glow and twinkle in the dusty light of both the sun and the moon.

The occasional locked gate marks the entrance to some of the more hidden estates of Spurs nobility. From this broad avenue, little can be seen of their splendor. Behind the imposing gate recedes a proud drive, disappearing mysteriously into the trees. If not for the large imposing tower rising above the hedges it would be hard to discern anything was beyond the gate. It is apparent the residents do not wish to be disturbed.

Set in the marble base is a small plaque that reads, "For those who have gone before us." Many stand for a moment as they pass this way, giving thanks for the gift of life that is given by both the apple tree and the Secians of long ago.

Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.

[Town Square Center.]

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.  A marble statue of a Human, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a rosewood sign, a crisp gold lettered vellum notice, a flowing white marble fountain, and a shimmering marble statue of a Dragon are here.

This area is illuminated.
