A large, stubborn dog has resolutely planted himself in the middle of the road. His master pulls on the rope around his neck, then pushes his backside firmly. It is quite apparent that nothing short of a nice meaty bone is going to make him budge. Those who travel this path keep their heads lowered and ignore the comical scene. A gnawing hunger and aching muscles after a long day of hard work keep most from paying attention to even the simple things around them.

The wooden shacks that line this dirt path are poorly built and falling apart. Some have holes so large that you can see inside to their dark rooms. Many of the tiny structures tilt to the side, almost falling over in sheer despair.  An open steel gate, some trailing coral hued mistflowers, a graceful bamboo trellis, a glowing tall wrought iron street lantern, a pair of open grey speckled granite doors, and a coral trimmed glass window are here.

Thankfully the air here is a little clearer, although the sights are not any better. A few feet away two hungry Thugians are fighting over the corpse of a dead rabid dog. They stop long enough to glance your way, look back at the dog's corpse, and then stare thoughtfully at each other - well, as thoughtful as a Thugian can be. They lumber to their feet and start heading your way, but halfway to you they start fighting with each other. You decide this is a good moment to move along quickly.

Whoever lives here must not fear invaders as it looks like the drawbridge hasn't been lifted in a long time.  A giant steelwood drawbridge is here.

[Valeria's Keep, Courtyard]

Perfectly manicured, green grass stretches from the gates to the manor house. Stunning topiaries line the gravel path that leads from the drawbridge to the entrance of the stately home. Colorful birds flutter from the trees to the sky, startled from their rest by your passing.   A giant steelwood drawbridge, an intricate green topiary, and an intricate green topiary are here.

Everything in this courtyard looks well tended and cared for. This keep must have a very talented and dedicated gardener tending it. Beautiful flowers line the insides of the castle walls, their colors a bright contrast to the stark gray of the heavy stone walls.

[Valeria's Keep, Great Hall]

The great hall is dazzling in all its splendor. Giant colorful tapestries depicting legendary battles of old cover the walls. Heavy royal blue velvet drapes hang on the large glass windows that look out into the courtyard surrounding the keep. Polished white marble tiles cover the floor, and a narrow blue velvet carpet creates a path that leads to the grand staircase on the far side of the hall.   A swirling golden portal is here.

Pastel colored drawings of various creatures both real and imaginary cover the walls.  Friendly looking animals of every kind frolic around on a pastel blue background. Two small beds sit on either end of the room, one pink and one blue. Toys lay scattered about on the floor of the room and piled high on shelves.   An open gold-trimmed mahogany door, a colorful stained glass window, some colorful toys, a soft pink bed, a soft blue bed, and a swirling red portal are here.

You follow Umiak through a swirling red portal...


As you pass through, there is a twist, and a feeling of distance...

[Ledge.]

You're on a very small ledge from which tiny rocks crumble and fall thousands of feet into the gorge below you. As you gaze around you are struck by visions of snow-capped mountain peaks and low hanging clouds which encircle you. Winding around this peak is a narrow ledge, the only viable path other than a suicidal plunge.   A swirling red portal is here.

It's hard to believe that this could even be considered a trail, it's so narrow.  The constant wear from the snow and wind has made it glisten with the slick sheen of moisture, adding to its treachery.  As you look around for some other path, you realize it's either this, or turn back.

Just past the recently cleared rubble of one of the arena worker's hovels is an old forgotten trail that leads to the north and northwest. Overgrown with plants and unused for a lengthy time, the trail is hard to make out in places.

The splintered remains of a dilapidated shack block you from exploring this area any further, and you are forced to turn back the way you came. The former neighbors now pick through the rubble pile looking for anything that might still be useful to them. Some carry off some wooden boards that once were the walls and pieces of the roof.

Rats and rodents scurry around the hovels looking for something to eat. You hear what you think are more of the furry creatures moving behind the piles of junk. Suddenly you realize that the noise is much too loud to be one of the small animals, and whatever might be making it is following along as you move along the path.

Thankfully the air here is a little clearer, although the sights are not any better. A few feet away two hungry Thugians are fighting over the corpse of a dead rabid dog. They stop long enough to glance your way, look back at the dog's corpse, and then stare thoughtfully at each other - well, as thoughtful as a Thugian can be. They lumber to their feet and start heading your way, but halfway to you they start fighting with each other. You decide this is a good moment to move along quickly.

The ramshackle huts give way to patched and faded tents along this portion of the path. Small cooking fires burn in front of each tent, and your nose catches a truly disgusting odor coming from the pots set over the fires. As your stomach turns, you quicken your steps away from the cooking meals in the hopes of finding some fresh air.

The wooden shacks that line this dirt path are poorly built and falling apart. Some have holes so large that you can see inside to their dark rooms. Many of the tiny structures tilt to the side, almost falling over in sheer despair.  An open steel gate, some trailing coral hued mistflowers, a graceful bamboo trellis, a glowing tall wrought iron street lantern, a pair of open grey speckled granite doors, and a coral trimmed glass window are here.

Growing within the shadow of the large Spurian Wall, even the sparse trees look run down. A few sickly looking leaves cling to their gnarled limbs. A broken swing hangs from one of the stronger looking branches, and you feel sorry for the children who must live here.  An open iron gate is here.

A large, well-kept gate is cut into the immense wall that surrounds Spur. Although everything else has fallen into disrepair, it is evident that security is still of foremost importance to the Governor. Uniformed guards patrol high above, conscientiously glancing down to assure peace is being kept along this well-traveled road. A crotchety old man leans against the wall, just out of view of the guards, counting the coin he has thus far appropriated this fine day.  An open iron gate and an open thick stone door are here.

Tall black spires rise from the building that towers above the hedge skirting the southern portion of Eastern Spur Road. Quickly whispered words and furtive gestures at the edifice seem enough to straighten out even the most unruly child. A distinctive howl pierces the air. Not many stop long enough to discern if it is just the wind or something far more sinister.

Uneven cobblestones line the roadway. Worn down by time and heavy traffic, the large potholes have filled with water, debris and unidentifiable muck, and are more prevalent than the stone. Those who travel this way have grown accustomed to the trouble spots, and appear to be dancing to a strange, unheard tune as they bob and weave their way toward their destination.

A small gate stands between Eastern Spur Road and the small, weed infested path that heads north. Through the rusted and worn gate you can make out a few old headstones and crypts, but the vines and overgrown brush obstruct your view. The rumors of evil death-howls and unusual occurrences have the locals hurrying past this location as quickly as possible.  An open black obsidian gate is here.

A large, stubborn dog has resolutely planted himself in the middle of the road. His master pulls on the rope around his neck, then pushes his backside firmly. It is quite apparent that nothing short of a nice meaty bone is going to make him budge. Those who travel this path keep their heads lowered and ignore the comical scene. A gnawing hunger and aching muscles after a long day of hard work keep most from paying attention to even the simple things around them.

The crowd travels in both directions, moving with definite purpose. Downtrodden and of modest means, most wear the tattered clothing of the poor. Whether pushing carts of homegrown fruits and vegetables towards market or carefully holding the hands of dirt-smudged children and heading towards the housing to the east, talk is kept to a minimum, and eye contact is not made.

A large double gate opens on the south side of the road, leading down an old cobbled path. Large wagons, small ox carts, and in some cases old buckboards make the turn toward the cemetery carrying their precious cargo to its final resting place. A large group of darkly-clad San Elves stand just outside the gate, carefully perusing those who pass by. It becomes obvious that those in Taath's Temple will be quickly informed of any insurgent groups heading their direction.  A large double gate is here.

Huge, colorful silk banners float proudly in the breeze from the giant stone arch that provides passage to the reopened Spurian Arena. The gladiators that once sat dejected and forlorn against the arch now stand proudly and alert, polishing their swords to the highest sheen, and adjusting their helms and breastplates. A long line of potential competitors and audience members alike is beginning to form, the last of whom glance uneasily in the direction of the looming cemetary before turning their attention back on the huge arena ahead.  An open iron gate and a stone arch are here.

A diverse group of people travel through this large iron gateway. Gladiators lead criminals towards the arena. It is readily apparent that only the gladiators return, usually with a satisfied smirk on their faces. A large group of guards on top of the large Spurian Wall keeps a careful watch on the downtrodden who travel this way. Their appearance makes them suspect, their lack of strength, natural victims.  An open iron gate and a street lantern are here.

A colorfully clad flerian calls out the odds on newly sentenced criminals as they are marched slowly by heading towards their fate in the arena. For some the chance to fight will mean they live, for others the arena can be a cruel and painful death. One must wonder if many who are led to the arena would have preferred a simple execution.  A street lantern is here.

Those who use Condemned Walk as a thoroughfare find themselves amongst an interesting group of travelers.

There has been many a time when a poor man has been mistaken for a common criminal and sent to battle those in the arena.  A street lantern is here.

A small rivulet of blood flows down the path that leads from the north and meets up with Condemned Walk. At the end of the path lies Execution Square and its viewing stands. It is at this point that the sentenced criminals discover their fate. Many hope to battle for their lives in the arena, but for most, the sentence is execution by one of the Spurian Justices.

The large temple of Rinanni rises to the north, its white marble almost glowing in the light.  A street lantern is here.

Many people crowd the narrow Bazaar Path, either heading towards the infamous Bazaar, or forcing their way back towards Trade Way. For a small price, a farmer can rent a booth and directly market his goods. Both some of the best and some of the worst deals can be made within this collection of stalls. The tall wall of Spur looms high to the east, and many of the guards take an early peek into the carts and the goods coming to market.  A street lantern is here.

A sign over the door announces the location as Gwollin's Brews.  An open faded walnut door and a street lantern are here.

The well-defined Bazaar path heads off to the west. This corner is a mix of the old and the new. On one corner an old stall is barely standing. The roof has caved in, and it quickly becomes apparent that this location has become a local dump. Pieces of wood that look suspiciously like some of the leftovers from other construction sites are piled on top of rotting offal. On the opposite corner a new tent is being erected, its high roof and vivid coloring pleasing to the eye.  An open stall and a street lantern are here.

[The Bazaar.]

A new stall has been hastily constructed on this site, in the shadow of the large Spurian Wall. Most chose to build well within the Bazaar as opposed to this outer path. Low-grade wood and bent nails make up this sorry excuse for a business establishment. A small sign on the front has a crude picture of a key on it, and the name, "Skugz."  A crooked wooden sign, a weathered dark wooden stall, and a broken street lantern are here.

Two large Oog-ra guards refuse to allow anyone to continue south. With loud gestures and over exaggerated pointing, they send wagons to the east or back north. With some slapping of backs, and happy grins, they congratulate themselves on following directions. A yell is heard from the south as Skugz screams, "Keep meee dooor clear...yes yeees...keep it clear." It is a wonder that he hasn't figured out they are turning away his customers.

A slinky dressed female San Elf preens and giggles garnering the attention of several humans leaning out the window of the guards' quarters. Catcalls and whistles abound as she shows more thigh then is warranted. A wagon driver, distracted by the view, almost drives into a cart coming the opposite direction. Shouts are exchanged and fists shaken, as the San female snickers at all those involved.  A street lantern is here.

Bazaar Path follows the line of the Spurian Wall. High above you can hear orders being barked and guards marching in rhythm. The closeness of the wall to the path has essentially blocked any breeze that might waft through the area. The stagnant air holds in the smells of food, incense and lots of bodies. It is not unusual to see the cart drivers with triangles of cloth pulled up over their nose and mouths.  A street lantern is here.

Several large carts head west, full of various items the owners are sure will sell for a decent profit. Empty carts, the sign of a prosperous day, head east. An old Thugian pulls and pushes a very stubborn donkey. Neither end seems to be cooperating with his demands. Two small children dance around the Thugian and the donkey, chanting and singing a nasty song. Quickly, he takes out a switch, which is enough encouragement for both the donkey to move and the children to run.  A street lantern is here.

Bazaar Path makes a sudden left hand turn, following the direction of the large Spurian Wall. Carts and wagons creak in protest as their heavy loads shift precariously.

The going slows down briefly as someone stops dead in their tracks. Every so often one feels the need to take in the sounds and smells that are uniquely the Bazaar.

Further passage along Bazaar Path is blocked occasionally by brawling peasants.

When guards are forced to leave their posts to settle the arguments, all involved lose.  A street lantern is here.

Many people crowd the narrow Bazaar Path, either heading towards the infamous Bazaar, or forcing their way back towards Trade Way. For a small price, a farmer can rent a booth and directly market his goods. Both some of the best and some of the worst deals can be made within this collection of stalls. The tall wall of Spur looms high to the east, and many of the guards take an early peek into the carts and the goods coming to market.  A street lantern is here.

A human couple exit the building, arm in arm. A small sign stands beside the intersection.  A sign, an open glossy lacquered oak door, and a street lantern are here.

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.   A flowing white marble fountain, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a marble statue of a Human, a rosewood sign, a gnarled weathered oak branch, a small vial of madness cure, a wooden torch, and a two-handed bronze pike are here.

Beds of wildflowers line the carefully placed cobblestones along this street. A pair of love birds, cooing in delight, sit upon a white marble bench. The giggles and laughs of a pair of trysting lovers echoes from the room in the Traveler's Hostel to the east. It is certain that Rinanni looks down upon this scene with delight.  A white marble bench and a street lantern are here.

A peaceful bliss pervades the very core of this guilded path. Below a large oak tree a couple of Rinannian priestesses sing lightly in Secti. Several merchants pause to listen to the song. Even a few hardened warriors cannot help but smile at the sweet melody.  A large oak tree and a street lantern are here.

The distant glimmer from a temple made of white marble and pearl catches your eye. An intricate gilded iron gate and a small winding path are all that separate you from the dazzling temple of Rinanni. Majestic marble statues of doves in flight stand on either side of the gate. The gaze of their peaceful eyes seems to follow your every movement.  An open intricately gilded iron gate, a pair of pure white marble dove statues, an open dragon-etched emerald door, and a street lantern are here.

A large stone building rises just to the east of Northern Avenue. These barracks house those known as Dread Knights. It is not unusual to see patrols of this elite group heading down the street towards Town Square. One would hope their presence would allow everyone to live in peace. If only they would stop fingering their swords all the time, you might believe it yourself.  A street lantern is here.

Northern Avenue ends at a gateway set within the massive city walls. On the other side of the gate are the Guild Halls. Those who pass through accept the bond of peace that the Guilds impose on all who desire their services. On either side of the gate guards stand at attention saluting all those who pass by.  An open iron gate, an open thick stone door, and a street lantern are here.

The city walls tower high above you at the entrance to the guild district. On top of the wall, a very bored looking guard with a lazy eye watches those passing through the gate. The large guild buildings spread out around the district, bustling with the day-to-day activity of the city's guild groups.  An open iron gate and a street lantern are here.

The massive building of the Merchant's Guild looms over a vast part of the guild district. The activity at the main door of the guild is mind numbing as hundreds of citizens and merchants alike rush in and out of the guild to handle their business. While the governor has control over the city guard, many claim it is the Merchant's Guild that runs the city of Spur.  An open exquisite polished mahogany door and a street lantern are here.

The sounds of clashing steel and the calls of battle fill the air near the entrance to the Mercenary's Guild.

By the looks of it, some of the veterans are giving a barbarian near the front door a hard time.  An open white cedar door and a street lantern are here.

A narrow steel gate leads through a short white stone wall. Beyond the gate lies the practice yard for the Mercenary's Guild. Novice mercenaries sit or stand outside the gate, either resting from their exertions or gathering their courage to enter. Piles of old bandages lie beside the road.

High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.   A flowing white marble fountain, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a marble statue of a Human, a rosewood sign, a gnarled weathered oak branch, a small vial of madness cure, a wooden torch, and a two-handed bronze pike are here.

Four draft horses stomp at the ground in annoyance as two miners struggle with the broken wheel of a horse-cart, filled to the top with glittering dark ore. One heavily muscled Hithual curses fluently in Battle as he attempts to leverage the cart with a plank from its own sideboard. The attempt to thread the axle with a new wheel fails, setting off shouts of pain and frustration.

Travelers from Rathan to the northwest, and the Trade Route to the south, converge at Spur's west gate. Guards posted on the ground give those seeking to enter the city a cursory once-over. Their lack of interest shows that anyone approaching has already been observed from above for some time. A grate in the ground loosens mud from wagon wheels and hooves before they pass through the gate, helping to keep the streets of Spur fairly clean.  An open giant black iron gate, a giant green oak tree, a small blue pool, a thick oak grate over the pool, and a polished stone marker are here.

Oak trees surround you on every side reaching their leaves up to the sky in majestic splendor. Rising high above the rest of the oaks stands a massive tree, clearly hundreds of years older than those around it within this section of the forest. A small path curves around the base of the tree and enters what looks to be some sort of small clearing, you can see a few Elves dressed entirely in green walking within the clearing, though telling them from the forest is proving a difficult task. A small sign hangs above the path that reads, "Foresters Guild".  A giant green oak tree, a golden oak tree, a giant ancient oak tree, a worn grassy path, an open faded burlap pouch, and an open supple sack are here.

Oak trees surround you on every side reaching their leaves up to the sky in majestic splendor. Rising high above the rest of the oaks stands a massive tree, clearly hundreds of years older than those around it within this section of the forest. A small path curves around the base of the tree and enters what looks to be some sort of small clearing, you can see a few Elves dressed entirely in green walking within the clearing, though telling them from the forest is proving a difficult task. A small sign hangs above the path that reads, "Foresters Guild".  A giant green oak tree, a golden oak tree, a giant ancient oak tree, and a worn grassy path are here.

As you move into the clearing you begin to realize that the few Elves you saw before were in fact more than a dozen people of different races moving amongst the clearing or along its edges. All dressed to match the trees and foliage of the forest, you could not distinguish them at all from a distance from the woods in which they live their day to day lives. It is here that the guild of foresters trains and practices so as to protect Elindale's forests with their lives. Though they all seem rather quiet, you notice every single one of them does not miss a single movement you make within the clearing.  A worn grassy path is here.

Oak trees surround you on every side reaching their leaves up to the sky in majestic splendor. Rising high above the rest of the oaks stands a massive tree, clearly hundreds of years older than those around it within this section of the forest. A small path curves around the base of the tree and enters what looks to be some sort of small clearing, you can see a few Elves dressed entirely in green walking within the clearing, though telling them from the forest is proving a difficult task. A small sign hangs above the path that reads, "Foresters Guild".  A giant green oak tree, a golden oak tree, a giant ancient oak tree, and a worn grassy path are here.

Travelers from Rathan to the northwest, and the Trade Route to the south, converge at Spur's west gate. Guards posted on the ground give those seeking to enter the city a cursory once-over. Their lack of interest shows that anyone approaching has already been observed from above for some time. A grate in the ground loosens mud from wagon wheels and hooves before they pass through the gate, helping to keep the streets of Spur fairly clean.

Symher the Usil Trader sits in a corner with a small lamp cataloging and appraising the various items he has deemed fit to buy.  The cluttered shelves are piled so high it's a wonder he can keep track.  You carefully make your way through the armor, weapons and assorted sundries, to the counter.  A pair of open double applewood doors are here.

A new building has been erected on this side street. It is sturdily constructed from wood and brick, and bears a sign reading, "Symher's Trading Post." Various objects line the window display ranging from weapons and armor to random objects you've never seen before. Insistent bartering goes on at all hours.  A pair of open double applewood doors and a street lantern are here.

Situated between the well-traveled Trade Way to the north and the fine shops of Market Circle to the south, this small stretch of road is busy at all times of day. Adventurers with sacks of plundered goods leave Market Street and head west where a shrewd businessman has set up shop in this busy area of the Market District. A small shop stands slightly to the east of the arch leading into Merchant Circle, light shining through its red glass door and illuminating the store front in a cheerful, ruby glow.  A street lantern, an opaque ruby red glass door, and a gold lettered wooden sign are here.

Market Street ends here at a large archway. People bustle in and out of the arch, some without so much as a nod. The city wall rises up to the south and west of the buildings of Market Circle. A small sign is posted on the wall beside the archway.  A street lantern is here.

[Market Circle.]

An arch between two large buildings connects Market Circle and Market Street. The more reputable shopkeepers do business within the circle, but pay higher taxes for the privilege. The buildings have been built to last, as these merchants are no traveling tinkers. Interlocking stone walkways and colorful plantings span this central area. Despite the number of animals waiting outside the bank for their owners, the area is spotless. Loud chatter in many languages can be heard from the southwest.  A marble archway, an open elegant gold-trimmed walnut door, and a wooden sign are here.

The buildings of Market Circle stand to the south. It becomes obvious that the area through the arch is a much cleaner marketplace than the bazaar. An inviting eatery stands beside the road, its door open to those weary after a long trip to Spur, as well as those preparing to venture to the great expanses beyond the west gate. A human couple exit the building, arm in arm. A small sign stands beside the intersection.  A sign, an open glossy lacquered oak door, and a street lantern are here.

Many townsfolk pass along this busy thoroughfare. Rich and poor alike mix freely on this street, much to the dismay of a passing nobleman. A young human struggles with an armful of packages and two young children in tow. Those in need of goods or supplies head west towards the market, those looking for the news of the day head east towards Town Square.  A street lantern is here.

A large gate separates the Merchant District and Town Square-the hub of Spur's activity. The partially opened gate is currently able to accommodate the simultaneous passage of several locals and visitors, but can be expanded to accept carriages, or sealed to ward against invasion.  Guards stand sentry from atop the wall as well as the ground.  A street lantern is here.

Merchant Walk comes to an abrupt end at a massive moonsilver gate. The towering walls of Spur on either side of the gates force all to pass by the guards who are constantly on the watch for thieves and bandits. Just beyond the gates one can glimpse the bustling Merchant District of Spur.  A gilded oak sign and a street lantern are here.

Several city guardsmen have just finished wrestling to the ground some young tough thieves, who thought to rob one of the returning merchants. To one side a relieved-looking Fir Elf gentleman holds on tightly to his gold-tipped walking stick, as the human boy yells his innocence to any who might listen. His pleas fall on deaf ears as the guards drag him away.  A street lantern is here.

Merchants, some in frilly finery, others dressed in homespun wools, travel back and forth along this street on their way to and from work. They seem to blend together here, if only briefly.

A neatly kept park fronts this portion of Merchant Walk. Topiary and low shrubberies partition off small sections of the park.

People carrying bundles stream in from the west and rapidly lose themselves in the large crowds moving about in the vast town square. Several citizens head west with bulging coinpurses babbling excitedly about what they're going to purchase. Giggling children dart around the slower moving folks rushing on their way to spend the silvers in their pockets.  A street lantern is here.

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.   A flowing white marble fountain, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a marble statue of a Human, a rosewood sign, a gnarled weathered oak branch, a small vial of madness cure, a wooden torch, and a two-handed bronze pike are here.

The elegant Hotel Royale towers above the street, its emerald door sparkling in the light. The patrons that stroll in and out are catered to, doors opened and closed for them, and baggage and packages carried by harried servants. The large Bank of Spur sits on the east side of the square. Its location close to the Royale is not a coincidence. A gold-trimmed door is proof of the success of this branch of the Spurian bank and those who run it.  An elegant gold-trimmed walnut door, open emerald steel door, and a street lantern are here.
