[The Great Room.]

An enormous circle of smooth oak columns create the walls of the Great Room. From the door, the hard-packed floor descends to a blazing fire pit with aromatic woods such as apple wood, orange and juniper. Fragrant braided sweet-grass mats are placed randomly around the fire pit. Horn sconces bearing beeswax candles emit a soft light, which permeates the room. A simple, yet elegant redwood plaque adorns the far wall. Carved into this plaque is a dedication. A golden flag is prominently displayed against one wall. Mounted above the grand oak door is a leather banner that has "Walk in Honor" branded into it. A Saldaean crafted, walnut weapons case stands in the corner of the room. Various Leuian symbols are hammered into the moonsilver panels adorning the case's doors. A highly polished, maple pantry sits next to the weapons case and bears the mark of the Leuian warrior on each of it's doors.  An east corridor, a west corridor, a golden flag, a redwood plaque, an open leather door, a closed grand oak door, an open Saldean crafted walnut weapons case, an open Leuian crafted oak trunk, an open polished maple pantry, an embroidered lupine hide cloak, and a long black leather belted robe are here.

An enormous circle of smooth oak columns create the walls of the Great Room. From the door, the hard-packed floor descends to a blazing fire pit with aromatic woods such as apple wood, orange and juniper. Fragrant braided sweet-grass mats are placed randomly around the fire pit. Horn sconces bearing beeswax candles emit a soft light, which permeates the room. A simple, yet elegant redwood plaque adorns the far wall. Carved into this plaque is a dedication. A golden flag is prominently displayed against one wall. Mounted above the grand oak door is a leather banner that has "Walk in Honor" branded into it. A Saldaean crafted, walnut weapons case stands in the corner of the room. Various Leuian symbols are hammered into the moonsilver panels adorning the case's doors.

Gwena leans her head on Yinnin's shoulder.

Tiruna says in Leuian, "please tell us what happened"

The eagle opens its hooked beak and as it lets out a shrill screech, the entire area becomes still and quiet.

Gwena says in Leuian, "I got tired of the ball.  So, Haberthan asked me to walk him back to Spur."

The battle cat purrs almost silently.

Gwena says in Leuian, "I had lent him some gold for clothes, so before I turned in for the night, he said he'd pay me back."

Gwena says in Leuian, "We went into the bank, and Emerald walked in."

The battle cat grooms itself.

Gwena says in Leuian, "The eighth piece was given to Merlin, the Muatana-Al."

Gwena says in Leuian, "It has been stolen."

The silvery white furred winter wolf howls loudly.

Gwena says in Leuian, "We believe that there is a spy who is feeding the identities of the Vessels to the beasts."

Gwena says in Leuian, "I cannot say who the remaining Vessels are."

Shaleu says in Leuian, "sometime back just after Ripley was attacked I thought a sans mage had a piece ripped from her"

Marishka furrows her brow in thought.

The silvery white furred winter wolf scratches behind its ears.

Yinnin's stomach growls.

Snowball's stomach growls.

The eagle suddenly fades away.

Gwena says to Muther in Leuian, "All the Vessels are known, and all are Taathian.  Converting to Taath is not going to cause a piece to form in one's blood."

Tiruna asks in Leuian, "ahh, but if we kill him?"

Audun twitches his tail.

[The Great Room.]

An enormous circle of smooth oak columns create the walls of the Great Room. From the door, the hard-packed floor descends to a blazing fire pit with aromatic woods such as apple wood, orange and juniper. Fragrant braided sweet-grass mats are placed randomly around the fire pit. Horn sconces bearing beeswax candles emit a soft light, which permeates the room. A simple, yet elegant redwood plaque adorns the far wall. Carved into this plaque is a dedication. A golden flag is prominently displayed against one wall. Mounted above the grand oak door is a leather banner that has "Walk in Honor" branded into it. A Saldaean crafted, walnut weapons case stands in the corner of the room. Various Leuian symbols are hammered into the moonsilver panels adorning the case's doors. A highly polished, maple pantry sits next to the weapons case and bears the mark of the Leuian warrior on each of it's doors.  An east corridor, a west corridor, a golden flag, a redwood plaque, an open leather door, a closed grand oak door, an open Saldean crafted walnut weapons case, an open Leuian crafted oak trunk, an open polished maple pantry, and a small cup of blue fizz are here.

Quietly, a yellow and black bumble bee flies around a small garden of fragrant violet orchids while a small bird eats some seed from a bird feeder hung on the walls of the fort. It is startled by approaching footsteps and flies off towards the northeast. A cool breeze carries the sweet scent of flowers, as the sound of distant fresh running water mumbles the whispered conversations of townspeople.  A closed maple door, a cozy cottage, a closed oak cottage door, a Pride Hall, and an exotic violet orchid box are here.

Within the heart of this proud fort one can see all around that the reconstruction of its buildings has begun. Large stones and logs have been stacked and piled, while some workers tirelessly attempt to repair the damage that occurred here during the Lords of Chaos wars. The buildings and homes of the people that resided here are slowly taking shape, though, far from completed. The smell of dyes, used to paint the town, permeate the area.  A breathtaking shimmering bouquet of moonflowers, an open light blue door, and a glowing wrought iron street lantern are here.

Off to the north one can make out the familiar sound of money. The clanking of coins can be heard distinctly. One of the only buildings that happened to survive in this fort from the days of lore, the bank. A small man can be seen traveling to and from the sidewalk to the very spot you are at with his hand held out and a look of sorrow in his eyes. His demeanor and countenance denotes that he might have once been a dignitary of the fort, but like the fort he and it strive to come back from the shambles.

Behind the counter, busily working away, an old Fir Elf is taking the deposits of the travelers passing through. At another counter a young Usil Elf gives the withdraws to the merchants and passersby. The floor is covered with a bluish-green carpeting that appears quite expensive and hardly scathed by the feet of wanderers. A reddish-brown couch adorned with the furs of many exotic beasts sits in the corner with great appeal to the weary.  An open rough wooden door and a bright wooden sign are here.

Large stones and logs have been stacked and piled, while some workers tirelessly attempt to repair the damage that occurred here during the Lords of Chaos wars. The buildings and homes of the people that resided here are slowly taking shape, though, far from completed. The smell of dyes, used to paint the town, permeate the area.  A breathtaking shimmering bouquet of moonflowers, an open light blue door, and a glowing wrought iron street lantern are here.

Two guards patrol above the gate, looking you over carefully before giving leave to pass through the heavy wood gate. Thick and long wooden ladders serve up to the guard's posts high in the sky so that they may have some relief from their duties overlooking the land and city. Through the slates of the wooden walkways, you can make out four archers playing a game of cards, weapons at the ready. A whip cracks loudly as a caravan heads out the gate towards Spur.  A glowing wrought iron lantern is here.

Rising up out of the plains, a large walled fort receives the end of the stone road. The river flows from either side, running through the fort from this angle of view. The vegetation surrounding the tradeway at this point has been burned out recently, allowing a clear field of vision from the tops of the walls ahead. The stones show little wear from the heavy traffic of feet and wheels alike; it has certainly been well constructed.

The grass rises taller and taller in every direction further limiting view just off the roadside. A second glance reveals that this is the lowest point in a large, shallow depression. The tradeway sinks a little lower as it gets closer to the river off to the west. A ditch runs alongside the river's side of the road, small puddles of water filling the bottom. Trickles filter into the puddles from the grass beyond as mosquitoes dart across the muddy surfaces.

Only the well-built, stone tradeway gives any hint of civilization ever having had any presence here. The tall grasses limit visibility nearby, hiding any wildlife that may be waiting for prey to stumble too close. A few blades of grass sway slightly in the breeze, some of them broken by the passing of something heavy over them. One of the larger stones in the road, broken loose from its mortar, waits patiently to be repaired.

The stone paved tradeway stretches across the open plains, interrupting nature's task of consuming the land. An endless sea of grass surrounds you, lapping at the road much like the tides against a beach. The faintly damp wind occasionally blowing in from the west smells of earth. Some of the stones in the road interlock together to form the crude image of a lion. There is no discerning if it was done on purpose or sheer accident.

The tradeway runs across the open grasslands northeast towards the Spur, and southwest towards distant lands and eventually, the coast. The plains to the south and east seem totally indifferent to your existence. Just ahead, a small path moves up a village of huts spread out in a semi-circle. In the center of the village a giant fire pit sits where barbarians who wander through the village can sit around to stay warm.  A worn grassy path is here.

[Wilderness gate.]

Set within a wide tunnel leading through the hedge to the north is the Wilderness Gate. It separates the settled lands of Spur from the open plains to the south of the city. The plains stretch as far as the eyes can see, the horizon and the walls of the fort down the road the only blemishes of the grassy landscape in the distance. The stones of the road are smoothly set together, well built to withstand heavy travel. A broken wagon wheel, discarded some time ago, covers a spot of nearby grass, weeds trying to climb through the spokes.

An acrid stench assails your nose before the source becomes apparent. Something quite large, but definitely dead and half-eaten, lies between two large ravens. Squawking noisily, they compete over the carrion. Muffled growls emanate from the tree-line, and a sudden rustling causes the birds to take flight, leaving their prize behind.

Travelers from Rathan to the northwest, and the Trade Route to the south, converge at Spur's west gate. Guards posted on the ground give those seeking to enter the city a cursory once-over. Their lack of interest shows that anyone approaching has already been observed from above for some time. A grate in the ground loosens mud from wagon wheels and hooves before they pass through the gate, helping to keep the streets of Spur fairly clean.

A rickety criss-crossed rough beam fence pens the grazing of black and white cows whose ponderous forms are barely visible through the tall grass on either side of the road. To the north, the soft, undulating grassland floor of the wide valley succumbs to the rolling foothills, which in turn delineates the imposing outline of a vista-spanning mountain range. Many a traveler has witnessed this idyllic vantage point and has been drawn on to follow the road that travels into the heart of the mountains.

The mountains to the north reflect in perfectly upside-down symmetry on the still pond's surface, only wavering slightly in concentric circles to the deft touch of small insects.

As the road bends around a curve, ruts left by merchant's wagons cut so deeply into the mud that all wheeled vehicles are forced to follow the set path. Four loaded wagons of a merchants caravan stand idle as one larger than standard wagon skitters along the path. The buckboard's frame groans and strains to keep it inline while the driver attempts to negotiate the turn. Four dark maned, matched mules balk at the noise behind them, and stomp nervously over the deep ruts. The liveried caravan guards attempt to haul the mules forward, further adding to the mules stubborn refusal to move.

Debris from the trees' self-trimming mats the taller grasses into an impenetrable wall. The cypresses produce the necessary windbreak for the field to bear the heavy headed grain.

The worn merchants road travels the southern side of a low hill in one wide arc. The broad path is slightly banked to accomodate for the turn and incline. On the exposed side of the road, the sturdy road-bed is exposed to the elements and yet has remained solid. A neatly kept plank house with a stone well and fenced paddock overlooks grain fields to the southeast.

Broadening to fill the lee of a wide valley, the roadway passes by several temporary campsites where caravans have bolstered the existing comforts for their temporary encampments. Neat stacks of foraged sticks and axe-hewn firewood sit adjacent to the blackened rocks of two impromptu fire rings. Freshly dug midden pits waft clues to the camp's frequent use into the clean mountain air.

Empty wooden crates, broken harnesses, damaged pottery, and the usual byproducts of food preparation fill an impromptu refuse pile adjacent to two campsites. Both two and four legged scavengers ply through the pile, scattering it further and enlarging the boundary. The result is a landmark of incongruous shapes, colors and shadows along the otherwise bland sweep of grasslands through which the roadway travels.

Just to the north, the roadway curves gently around a bend in a large river that flows towards the southeast. An enormous smooth round rock splits off a small eddy from the main current resulting a deep, clear pool by the eastern side of the road. The cool calm water catches the reflection of the white snowcapped mountain range further up the valley while the river rushes past towards Spur. Five fishermen recline on folding chairs or against rocks, tethered by the silvery lines of their poles to the fishing hole. Each fisherman is spread evenly around the pool as if held apart by some invisible barrier as they eye the large shadowy fish shapes finning effortlessly against the mild current in the eddy.

[Tarath Gorge.]

Rough granite walls rise above you to the east and west. The area here is a bit rougher and seems to have been recently mined. Large veins of silver can be seen. Up overhead, on the western face of the gorge wall a large crack has appeared. Though large enough to fit a Thugian, the only thing exiting the crack is a steady stream of dripping water.

[Fort Tarath.]

You stand before a granite wall and large double gated doors. The walls are thick and finely crafted, and there seems to be a rather aged look about them.  The Gate is made of massive slabs of silver, while off to the left and right are the fort's impressive walls, able to withstand a rather large invasion or army if need be.  An open silver-trimmed black drathain gate is here.

The giant fortification wall is divided into two main sections by huge doors.  These doors have been made from silver and look as though they could stand even the most fearsome battering ram.  Guards standing atop the walls eye you closely.  To the north you can see the business district.  An open silver-trimmed black drathain gate is here.

This newly constructed road begins the climb to the mountain peaks as a vein from the main Rathan-Fort Tarath artery. Following the steep incline of the mountain's side, this twisting path travels its way to the opposite side of the City of Rathan. High above in that part of the mountain, a single silver-spired tower peaks through the misty mountain air and glistens slightly.

The roadway straightens out to the west but continues its incline along the base of the mountain. The walls of Fort Tarath stand tall between the walls of the gorge almost as if daring an army to try and breech them. Large piles of blackened rubble, the product of the roadway excavation, fill the narrow valley between the road edge and the mountain to the south.

Small shrubs cling to the mountain side above the roadway, helping to sway the effects of erosion and the buffeting winds.

High above the mountain base the roadway makes its climb toward the peak. Down below the cliff falls off suddenly into the valley.

Small birds fly high overhead, circling this part of the road. The span from the edge of the road to the southern mountain face is not very far, however the drop into the valley would be suicide.

Another massive boulder, black and melted, blocks any further passage toward the top of the mountain. Thick grey and white clouds hang heavily near the edge of the road, swirling ever so slightly in the breeze. There is no way to continue up the mountain except perhaps by climbing the sheer cliff wall. The clouds pulse slightly and gravitate toward the road surface, the sound of thunder rolling over the area.

A ribbon of pure silver stretches out through the billowing clouds toward the peak of the mountain. Each step is like walking on soft carpeting but without any solid underfooting to hold one up.

The strand twists and stretches and in some parts is not entirely there. Large holes open and close on its surface but without fail passage over these rifts is made without any problems. Above and surrounding the strand, the billowing clouds make up the walls of a silky tunnel, flickering with light and the sounds of rolling thunder every so often. The tunnel leads east to a solid mountain roadway and west into a blur.

The strand and tunnel end abruptly before you, dispersing in the strong wind that blows down from the mountain.

[Sky.]

There is nothing here but the open expanse of sky. A silvery walkway ends quite close to the east, its semi-solid footing welcome to most who cannot fly. Far northeast another part of the strand waits for a traveler to set foot on its surface to continue the journey up the mountain. A strong wind blows down from the mountain peak, attempting to bring the massive drop to the ground quickly and painfully to anyone stupid enough to wander out into the sky.  A fiery gate in the sky is here.

Nothing but sky and mountains stretch out on all sides. The drop from this height would surely be deadly to anyone. A sliver of silver glints in the distance, rolling slightly within a wall of clouds. To the northeast, as if floating in the sky, a large tower hovers under it's own power. A small white curl of smoke reaches out from the tower towards the small silver path.  Some alabaster upwards leading stairs are here.

[Cliff base.]

The black cliffs seem to surround you here, allowing passage only to the west and southwest. The area is strewn with black rubble, as if dislodged boulders fell from the top of the cliffs. Or were they pushed?

You follow Audun through a black rubble...

[Black tunnel.]

A narrow black passage through glassy volcanic rock opens before you. Scattered about on the ground are fragments of black stone, large and small. You begin to wonder just how stable this entire place is.  A black crack is here.

The darkness of this area is unmatched by the outer cave. You have entered a winding tunnel carved out of solid volcanic rock, perhaps a burned out age old lava tube. Now only sheer blackness flows through this tunnel. You have trouble with your sense of direction, the only beacon being the silvery door to the south.  A giant silvery door is here.

One of the larger golems stands straight against the wall, this one different from the others, its massive body almost completely clear and hard as a rock. In its hand sits a pulsating yellow crystal staff which gives of an strange but comforting glow. The golem is completely motionless, yet the glowing green orbs set into its head as eyes, follow you around the room.

The entire ground floor is open, the rear wall completely visible and swirling with different purple hues. A glimmer of silver can be seen rising through the ceiling in the northwest.  An open silver-trimmed purple crystal gate is here.

The strand widens toward the base of the tower, its silver-black surface reflecting the purple light from the walls. The tower is now completely in view, its walls not just glowing purple, but made of some sort of deep purple crystal magickally infused with a glowing light. There is but a single entrance gate and one narrow window slit high above the ground noticeable with a first glance. The silver spire hums slightly giving off a beautiful tune.

Nothing but sky and mountains stretch out on all sides. The drop from this height would surely be deadly to anyone. A sliver of silver glints in the distance, rolling slightly within a wall of clouds. To the northeast, as if floating in the sky, a large tower hovers under it's own power. A small white curl of smoke reaches out from the tower towards the small silver path.  Some alabaster upwards leading stairs are here.

There is nothing here but the open expanse of sky. A silvery walkway ends quite close to the east, its semi-solid footing welcome to most who cannot fly. Far northeast another part of the strand waits for a traveler to set foot on its surface to continue the journey up the mountain. A strong wind blows down from the mountain peak, attempting to bring the massive drop to the ground quickly and painfully to anyone stupid enough to wander out into the sky.  A fiery gate in the sky is here.

[Fort Tarath.]

You stand before a granite wall and large double gated doors. The walls are thick and finely crafted, and there seems to be a rather aged look about them.  The Gate is made of massive slabs of silver, while off to the left and right are the fort's impressive walls, able to withstand a rather large invasion or army if need be.  An open silver-trimmed black drathain gate is here.

Rough granite walls rise above you to the east and west. The area here is a bit rougher and seems to have been recently mined. Large veins of silver can be seen. Up overhead, on the western face of the gorge wall a large crack has appeared. Though large enough to fit a Thugian, the only thing exiting the crack is a steady stream of dripping water.

Old trees lay side by side with the massive boulders of the mountain, intermingling in a terrible landslide. The mountain top has broken off and slid across the eastern road stopping all forms of transportation. It would take years for mortal hands to remove the tons of stone from the original roadway to make it passable once again. Thankfully, nature has changed the landscape for the better, and has opened a gap through the mountain to the north.

Just to the north, the roadway curves gently around a bend in a large river that flows towards the southeast. An enormous smooth round rock splits off a small eddy from the main current resulting a deep, clear pool by the eastern side of the road. The cool calm water catches the reflection of the white snowcapped mountain range further up the valley while the river rushes past towards Spur. Five fishermen recline on folding chairs or against rocks, tethered by the silvery lines of their poles to the fishing hole. Each fisherman is spread evenly around the pool as if held apart by some invisible barrier as they eye the large shadowy fish shapes finning effortlessly against the mild current in the eddy.

As the road bends around a curve, ruts left by merchant's wagons cut so deeply into the mud that all wheeled vehicles are forced to follow the set path. Four loaded wagons of a merchants caravan stand idle as one larger than standard wagon skitters along the path. The buckboard's frame groans and strains to keep it inline while the driver attempts to negotiate the turn. Four dark maned, matched mules balk at the noise behind them, and stomp nervously over the deep ruts. The liveried caravan guards attempt to haul the mules forward, further adding to the mules stubborn refusal to move.

Their roots protectively sheltered from the weather, idiosyntric sprouts of taller grasses thrive haphazardly inside the wheel. Several tiny holes top small pyramids of sandy debris, where a few red fire ants scout their wagon-wheel domain for fodder.

The travel-worn road dips and curves around the low lying foothills. Each pass over the top of hillsides presents a new view of the mountain range. Each dip into small valleys reveal minute eco-systems that exist in each wagon wheel rut where water collects. Splayed avion tracks dot the dried mud in random order permanently recording the hunters conquest of lesser things from the mud and moss.

The road diverts around a small pool of murky water that lies to the north. A confusion of hoof prints muddies the shoreline where the placid bovines have come to water themselves. The pool is damned by a small hillock which allows no drainage so the pool remains stagnant. The mountains to the north reflect in perfectly upside-down symmetry on the still pond's surface, only wavering slightly in concentric circles to the deft touch of small insects.

A rickety criss-crossed rough beam fence pens the grazing of black and white cows whose ponderous forms are barely visible through the tall grass on either side of the road. To the north, the soft, undulating grassland floor of the wide valley succumbs to the rolling foothills, which in turn delineates the imposing outline of a vista-spanning mountain range. Many a traveler has witnessed this idyllic vantage point and has been drawn on to follow the road that travels into the heart of the mountains.

Grassy plains stretch out to the west across the wide flat valley broken only by the outline of a dark forest further to the southwest. The huge expanse of waving stalks is home to creatures large and small. Each has adapted to their own niche and are camouflaged from the casual observers gaze.

From the west spans a dark green forest of Sycamore and Beech trees that soak in the moister parts of the lower river valley. The tall, shaded forest breaks like a green tinged wave upon the tranquil calm of the grasslands. The huge trees within are ancient, reaching hundreds of feet into the air. As if steaming from a great cauldron, a heavy ground fog seeps from deep within the forest carrying with it the fresh smell of decomposing green matter.

Lush grass grows up to the borders of a thick, dense forest that cloaks the hills to the west. The grasslands thin near the grove as the huge trees completely shade the ground, and are replaced by taller bushes and juniper trees. The contrast between the waving stalks on the flat vista and the dark leaves of almost vertical trees is striking.

In the dusty distance, Spur's great wall demarks the southern end of this well-traveled merchant's road. Soaring majestically to the north stands the spiky pinnacles and snow topped peaks of an epic mountain range so immense that it separates lands, races, and cultures. Connecting the two is a merchant road built long ago.

The path is flanked by countless tall oaks, swaying peacefully in the wind. They do their best to hide the sky from view, making it hard to tell night from day at times. Littering the area are pieces of broken wagon, bits of human remains and dried splotches of blood. The remnants of a violent fight lie all around you, whomever used to belong to the wagon is no more than vulture food.  A bloody severed foot is here.

Oak trees surround you on every side reaching their leaves up to the sky in majestic splendor. Rising high above the rest of the oaks stands a massive tree, clearly hundreds of years older than those around it within this section of the forest. A small path curves around the base of the tree and enters what looks to be some sort of small clearing, you can see a few Elves dressed entirely in green walking within the clearing, though telling them from the forest is proving a difficult task. A small sign hangs above the path that reads, "Foresters Guild".  A giant green oak tree, a golden oak tree, a giant ancient oak tree, and a worn grassy path are here.

Travelers from Rathan to the northwest, and the Trade Route to the south, converge at Spur's west gate. Guards posted on the ground give those seeking to enter the city a cursory once-over. Their lack of interest shows that anyone approaching has already been observed from above for some time. A grate in the ground loosens mud from wagon wheels and hooves before they pass through the gate, helping to keep the streets of Spur fairly clean.  An open giant black iron gate, a giant green oak tree, a small blue pool, a thick oak grate over the pool, and a polished stone marker are here.

An acrid stench assails your nose before the source becomes apparent. Something quite large, but definitely dead and half-eaten, lies between two large ravens. Squawking noisily, they compete over the carrion. Muffled growls emanate from the tree-line, and a sudden rustling causes the birds to take flight, leaving their prize behind. Were those golden eyes flashing in the shadows?

Several San Elves, shackled at the ankles, stand by the road near the corner of the giant city wall. Two guards eye the chain gang carefully, as a harried Usil engineer pores over a set of drawings.

The stones of the road are smoothly set together, well built to withstand heavy travel.

The grass rises taller and taller in every direction further limiting view just off the roadside. A second glance reveals that this is the lowest point in a large, shallow depression. The tradeway sinks a little lower as it gets closer to the river off to the west. A ditch runs alongside the river's side of the road, small puddles of water filling the bottom. Trickles filter into the puddles from the grass beyond as mosquitoes dart across the muddy surfaces.

Rising up out of the plains, a large walled fort receives the end of the stone road. The river flows from either side, running through the fort from this angle of view.

Off to the north one can make out the familiar sound of money. The clanking of coins can be heard distinctly.

A small man can be seen traveling to and from the sidewalk to the very spot you are at with his hand held out and a look of sorrow in his eyes. His demeanor and countenance denotes that he might have once been a dignitary of the fort, but like the fort he and it strive to come back from the shambles.

One of the only buildings that happened to survive in this fort from the days of lore, the bank. A small man can be seen traveling to and from the sidewalk to the very spot you are at with his hand held out and a look of sorrow in his eyes. His demeanor and countenance denotes that he might have once been a dignitary of the fort, but like the fort he and it strive to come back from the shambles.  An open rough wooden door and a wooden sign are here.

Within the heart of this proud fort one can see all around that the reconstruction of its buildings has begun. Large stones and logs have been stacked and piled, while some workers tirelessly attempt to repair the damage that occurred here during the Lords of Chaos wars. The buildings and homes of the people that resided here are slowly taking shape, though, far from completed. The smell of dyes, used to paint the town, permeate the area.  A breathtaking shimmering bouquet of moonflowers, an open light blue door, and a glowing wrought iron street lantern are here.

Two guards patrol above the gate, looking you over carefully before giving leave to pass through the heavy wood gate. Thick and long wooden ladders serve up to the guard's posts high in the sky so that they may have some relief from their duties overlooking the land and city. Through the slates of the wooden walkways, you can make out four archers playing a game of cards, weapons at the ready. A whip cracks loudly as a caravan heads out the gate towards Spur.  A glowing wrought iron lantern is here.

Rising up out of the plains, a large walled fort receives the end of the stone road. The river flows from either side, running through the fort from this angle of view. The vegetation surrounding the tradeway at this point has been burned out recently, allowing a clear field of vision from the tops of the walls ahead. The stones show little wear from the heavy traffic of feet and wheels alike; it has certainly been well constructed.

The grass rises taller and taller in every direction further limiting view just off the roadside. A second glance reveals that this is the lowest point in a large, shallow depression. The tradeway sinks a little lower as it gets closer to the river off to the west. A ditch runs alongside the river's side of the road, small puddles of water filling the bottom. Trickles filter into the puddles from the grass beyond as mosquitoes dart across the muddy surfaces.

Only the well-built, stone tradeway gives any hint of civilization ever having had any presence here. The tall grasses limit visibility nearby, hiding any wildlife that may be waiting for prey to stumble too close. A few blades of grass sway slightly in the breeze, some of them broken by the passing of something heavy over them. One of the larger stones in the road, broken loose from its mortar, waits patiently to be repaired.

The stone paved tradeway stretches across the open plains, interrupting nature's task of consuming the land. An endless sea of grass surrounds you, lapping at the road much like the tides against a beach. The faintly damp wind occasionally blowing in from the west smells of earth. Some of the stones in the road interlock together to form the crude image of a lion. There is no discerning if it was done on purpose or sheer accident.

The tradeway runs across the open grasslands northeast towards the Spur, and southwest towards distant lands and eventually, the coast. The plains to the south and east seem totally indifferent to your existence. Just ahead, a small path moves up a village of huts spread out in a semi-circle. In the center of the village a giant fire pit sits where barbarians who wander through the village can sit around to stay warm.  A worn grassy path is here.

Set within a wide tunnel leading through the hedge to the north is the Wilderness Gate. It separates the settled lands of Spur from the open plains to the south of the city. The plains stretch as far as the eyes can see, the horizon and the walls of the fort down the road the only blemishes of the grassy landscape in the distance. The stones of the road are smoothly set together, well built to withstand heavy travel. A broken wagon wheel, discarded some time ago, covers a spot of nearby grass, weeds trying to climb through the spokes.

Through the gate lies the city of Spur, the major center of trade and civilization on the plains. The dusty road leading through the gates is well traveled, and walls of the city are in good repair. A small shack sits to the west of the road, during most times of the day a dusty coach can be seen waiting in front, its horses stomping with impatience to be gone. To the right of the door is a small window, its opening covered with metal bars. An old man, missing most of his teeth, waits patiently for the travelers to pay their fare, and then directs them into the waiting area. On the east side of the road a billowing multicolored tent has been erected, the hustle and bustle of merchants and customers can be seen coming and going at all times of the day.

Several members of the various mage orders of Spur and well-dressed shoppers seeking rarities travel along Knowledge's Path to and from the District of Magick. The district is the place to find the most talented artisans and craftiest merchants in Spur. It is also home to the mages of the non-elemental order.  A street lantern is here.

Before you stands a magnificent white marble temple dedicated to Odarous, the god of chivalry. Ten giant steps made of the same gleaming marble lead up to the temple entrance. Two large statues stand at the base of the stairs, also carved of breath-taking marble. One is a warrior bearing a massive sword and a large shield. The other is a cleric with an amulet bearing the mark of Odarous in one hand and a large mace in the other.  Some gleaming white marble stairs, a polished white marble statue, a polished white marble statue, and a street lantern are here.

Commercial buildings flank Town Square to the west and south of this corner. Imposing buildings stand stiffly to your west, while those to the south have a slightly seedy look about them.  The door to the west has a freshly painted sign over it,  "Under New Management."  A closed tan weathered pine door, a large doorway, and a street lantern are here.

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.   A flowing white marble fountain, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a marble statue of a Human, a carved marble statue of a Dragon, a rosewood sign, a small jagged cobblestone crack, a welcome mat, a quiver of black fletched wooden bolts, a moonsilver oil lamp, a quiver of white fletched steelwood arrows, and a tasty piece of blueberry pie are here.

The elegant Hotel Royale towers above the street, its emerald door sparkling in the light. The patrons that stroll in and out are catered to, doors opened and closed for them, and baggage and packages carried by harried servants. The large Bank of Spur sits on the east side of the square. Its location close to the Royale is not a coincidence. A gold-trimmed door is proof of the success of this branch of the Spurian bank and those who run it.  An elegant gold-trimmed walnut door, open emerald steel door, and a street lantern are here.

[The Royale.]

A short entrance hall provides passage in and out of the exquisite Hotel Royale. A burly Thugian and a tall Monitanian carefully assess everyone as they enter. They prevent any pets from entering and keep out all but the quickest or sneakiest of the riffraff. A narrow passageway leads to the stables.  An open emerald steel door is here.
