A deep crevice separates the mountain trail from a fort to the northwest. A simple, but sturdy wooden bridge provides the only means of crossing the chasm to the fortress gates. The walls of the fort are dull, unadorned and made of the same rock as the mountain. You see smoke rising from behind the walls, promising inviting firesides, warmth, and shelter.  A bridge is here.

The road bends from the southwest to the north here. A gateway leads off to the southeast and a dirt-packed road there. A small farmhouse can be seen at its end, the barn nearby towering over it.

[Field.]

This wide strip of grass along the roadside is used by the guards at the gate to the southwest. Travelers from the south are directed here where they can be searched for contraband and illegal goods. Also, proper taxes can be assessed this way.

Stretching as far as the eye can see to the east and west is the hedge. A thick line of trees and shrubs that serves as a natural wall between civilization and wilderness. A small outpost stands guard here, its door open to friends, barred to enemies.

This narrow tunnel through the hedge leads up to the gateway that lets out to the wilderness beyond. Though it used to see heavy traffic from the south, the docks have made this gate largely a place of semi-banishment for the guards.

>[Wilderness gate.]

Set within a wide tunnel leading through the hedge to the north is the Wilderness Gate. It separates the settled lands of Spur from the open plains to the south of the city. The plains stretch as far as the eyes can see, the horizon and the walls of the fort down the road the only blemishes of the grassy landscape in the distance. The stones of the road are smoothly set together, well built to withstand heavy travel. A broken wagon wheel, discarded some time ago, covers a spot of nearby grass, weeds trying to climb through the spokes.

>[Southern Tradeway.]

The tradeway runs across the open grasslands northeast towards the Spur, and southwest towards distant lands and eventually, the coast. The plains to the south and east seem totally indifferent to your existence. Just ahead, a small path moves up a village of huts spread out in a semi-circle. In the center of the village a giant fire pit sits where barbarians who wander through the village can sit around to stay warm.  A worn grassy path is here.

>[Barbarian Village]

A huge circle of rocks form a massive fire pit in the center of the village, smoldering embers from within the fire pit show that it hasn't been long since a fire warmed those in the village. It is here that those who wander the plains of the southlands gather together as something of a community. Barbarians from numerous clans come here to hone their skills and prove their honor in duels of battle. Entrances to all the huts seem to be closed except the largest hut in the middle of the semi-circle.  A worn grassy path and an open dried mud hut are here.

An elderly man sits before you with his legs crossed, he looks at you carefully, as if appraising your very soul. He is dressed in the simple garb of a plainsmen, two eagle feathers rise up from the band around his head. After showing you a few of the items the villagers have made by hand he is selling, he offers you a seat across from him.  An exit from the hut and a crack in the wall are here.

You slide from behind a rock and into a cavern. Its walls are worn smooth by time and a ceremonial bonfire blazes in its center. The floor is of deep, white sand. Colorful paintings form a mural upon the western wall.  A flaming ceremonial bonfire and a shadowed crevice are here.
