[Magick Festival, Second Peddler's Area.]

High above in the fiery sky - not quite night, not quite day - hang tiny flickering lights in the runic shape of protection. An occasional rune plummets to the clouds that serve as the magickally structured walkway, illuminating the touched area and sending arcs of electricity between one ionic light to another. The clouds continually shift beneath you; the shapes always in a state of flux.  Some fluffy white clouds, some flaming flickering protection runes, a smoke and fire MAGICK ITEMS sign, an open chest, a carved maple HAIR STYLES list, a sparkling HAIR PRICES sign, an inky TEXTURES list, a rosewood LENGTH list, a cheerful red EYE PRICES list, and a cheerful red EYE SHAPES are here.

An ornate wrought iron fence, detailed with the various runes for each class, surrounds a raised platform in the center of the area; the runes glow and pulsate. The clouds beneath your feet give gently with each footstep, leaving ethereal impressions momentarily before fluffing back up. Above, the sky is alive with streaks of lightening that dance back and forth between more clouds and illuminate the orange-red sky with flashes of brilliant white. Misty letters swirl before you, shifting and melding together into sentences.  Some fluffy white clouds, some glowing dancing lightning streaks, some misty swirling words in the sky, a hovering oak door partially open, an open runesilver handled glass trapdoor, and some floating glass steps are here.

Some fluffy white clouds, some flaming flickering protection runes, a smoke and fire MAGICK ITEMS sign, an open chest, a carved maple HAIR STYLES list, a sparkling HAIR PRICES sign, an inky TEXTURES list, a rosewood LENGTH list, a cheerful red EYE PRICES list, and a cheerful red EYE SHAPES are here.

[Magick Festival, Second Peddler's Area.]

High above in the fiery sky - not quite night, not quite day - hang tiny flickering lights in the runic shape of protection. An occasional rune plummets to the clouds that serve as the magickally structured walkway, illuminating the touched area and sending arcs of electricity between one ionic light to another. The clouds continually shift beneath you; the shapes always in a state of flux.  Some fluffy white clouds, some flaming flickering protection runes, a smoke and fire MAGICK ITEMS sign, an open chest, a carved maple HAIR STYLES list, a sparkling HAIR PRICES sign, an inky TEXTURES list, a rosewood LENGTH list, a cheerful red EYE PRICES list, and a cheerful red EYE SHAPES are here.

This area is illuminated.

[Festival of Magick, Entrance.]

An ornate wrought iron fence, detailed with the various runes for each class, surrounds a raised platform in the center of the area; the runes glow and pulsate. The clouds beneath your feet give gently with each footstep, leaving ethereal impressions momentarily before fluffing back up. Above, the sky is alive with streaks of lightening that dance back and forth between more clouds and illuminate the orange-red sky with flashes of brilliant white. Misty letters swirl before you, shifting and melding together into sentences.  Some fluffy white clouds, some glowing dancing lightning streaks, some misty swirling words in the sky, a hovering oak door partially open, an open runesilver handled glass trapdoor, and some floating glass steps are here.

[Festival of Magick, Levitating Disc.]

The platform on which you stand is made out of a thick glass, lending a distorted view of clouds and stars lazily passing beneath it. A powerful, softly humming force provides an unseen wall for safety of its passengers as the platform floats mysteriously upon the air. Within the bubble of energy, be it day or night, the air glows a combination of fiery reds and oranges against a darkened blue. Stars faintly glow and twinkle in the dusty light of both the sun and the moon.  A thick transparent glass platform, some glowing twinkling stars, a fiery sunset of varying hues, some floating glass steps, and some misty grey spiraling clouds heading down are here.

[Road.]

The road coming in from the north bends around to the southwest here as it makes its way through an open field. Used by travelers most of the year, the fields host parties and day excursions from the city in good weather.  A frozen jagged lightning bolt is here.

[South gate.]

Through the gate lies the city of Spur, the major center of trade and civilization on the plains. The dusty road leading through the gates is well traveled, and walls of the city are in good repair. A small shack sits to the west of the road, during most times of the day a dusty coach can be seen waiting in front, its horses stomping with impatience to be gone. To the right of the door is a small window, its opening covered with metal bars. An old man, missing most of his teeth, waits patiently for the travelers to pay their fare, and then directs them into the waiting area. On the east side of the road a billowing multicolored tent has been erected, the hustle and bustle of merchants and customers can be seen coming and going at all times of the day.  A rainbow silk tent, a closed iron gate, and a fluffy white layer of snow are here.

A well-guarded gateway separates the city's residential district from the farmlands just beyond. Guards carefully eye all that enter or exit the city, beckoning gruffly to random travelers for a closer inspection. The structure of the guards' barracks is visible above the road to the west. A weathered wooden sign is posted by the gate.  An open iron gate, a wooden sign, a street lantern, an open thick stone door, and a fluffy white layer of snow are here.

[Noble Way.]

The occasional locked gate marks the entrance to some of the more hidden estates of Spurs nobility. From this broad avenue, little can be seen of their splendor. Behind the imposing gate recedes a proud drive, disappearing mysteriously into the trees. If not for the large imposing tower rising above the hedges it would be hard to discern anything was beyond the gate. It is apparent the residents do not wish to be disturbed.  A street lantern, a closed morbius door, and an open black iron gate are here.

Majestic elms continue to line this broad roadway, sheltering the avenue on both sides and further enhancing the grandiose atmosphere. Fronting the beautiful homes, cobbled paths edged with narrow flower beds meander through nearby private gardens. Though they appear wonderful places to spend an afternoon or take a picnic, the glances from those tending the estates makes it clear they are only for the invited.  A street lantern is here.

A small roadway bordered by flowering hedges bisects the wide avenue of Noble Way at a right angle, heading east to west.  A thick, sturdy sign stands just off to the side of a charming path, its large friendly letters intent on luring travelers into the city's premiere roadstay, the Gilded Lion Inn. The entrance is clearly marked and welcoming, extending off to the southeast.  A wooden sign and a street lantern are here.

Occasional gates and driveways lead back into the well-kept estates of the city's nobility, breaking and adding interest to the defining plane of the walls lining Noble Way.

Numerous trees lining the avenue serve as the dividing border between the majestic estates of the nobility and the lightly traveled roadway.

Leaving the exceptionally wealthy estates of the Spurian nobility, Noble Way heads toward the Town Square to the northwest. Along the roadside can be seen the in-city homes of successful merchants and other wealthy citizens of the Spur. The homes display a slightly different style, perhaps they are not quite so restrained; a touch more exuberance and freedom with materials is displayed.  A street lantern is here.

Noble Way continues to wind its way among the rather modestly sized, but elegant, homes of the Spur's successful. Many a peasant farmer may live in homes larger than these, but none can match the quality found here. A peaceful, luxurious feeling pervades this part of town; perhaps it is the drifting floral scents wafting from the well-tended gardens.

An unusually large home, even for this part of town, lies off to the west. It seems as if one ambitious owner is slowly buying up the lots next to his and adding them to his own. Groundskeepers are at work in the surrounding gardens, trimming and raking, so intent on their work they do not bother to acknowledge the passing traffic on the road.  A street lantern is here.

You can make out city guardsmen peering down attentively at all that approach from their posts atop the imposing wall. They seem to take a greater interest in this part of town, though there does not seem to be anything threatening enough here to warrant such attention.

Standing next to the large iron gate that separates the center of town from those of the elite class are several of the Spurian Guard. They are here to assist all who pass with the simple kindness of opening a gate, or the more important task of escorting those in need to the bank or market. A young looking cadet rubs wax into the stones of the city wall, his task is daunting, but one that will teach him discipline.  An open iron gate and a street lantern are here.

The boughs of a large apple tree hang over the well tended avenue. Below the beautiful tree stands a small fountain. Atop the fountain is an intricately carved Secian who appears to be dancing with the water as it splashes around her. Set in the marble base is a small plaque that reads, "For those who have gone before us." Many stand for a moment as they pass this way, giving thanks for the gift of life that is given by both the apple tree and the Secians of long ago. Large piles of dirt and broken stone lay on either side of the street as workmen ready the east and west alleys for expansion.  A street lantern, an open Secian etched moonsilver door, a pair of open silver forged swinging doors, and a sign above the doors are here.

Vast estates tower over the huge Spurian wall towards the south. The well-to-do who live in these homes idle away their days, enjoying the luxury of time. Standing next to a very empty lantern pole, a small Flerian child insists in a plaintive wail, that he had nothing to do with the missing lantern. The well-dressed guard that interrogates him keeps pointing at a small sack on the ground and its obvious contents.  An open small burlap sack, a street lantern, and a lantern are here.

The outward appearance of the people here seems a bit classier. Rich clothing and large coin purses are prevalent amongst the travelers.

The patrons that stroll in and out are catered to, doors opened and closed for them, and baggage and packages carried by harried servants. The large Bank of Spur sits on the east side of the square. Its location close to the Royale is not a coincidence. A gold-trimmed door is proof of the success of this branch of the Spurian bank and those who run it.  An elegant gold-trimmed walnut door, an open emerald steel door, a street lantern, and a new rosewood sign pointing southeast are here.

The elegant Hotel Royale towers above the street, its emerald door sparkling in the light. The patrons that stroll in and out are catered to, doors opened and closed for them, and baggage and packages carried by harried servants. The large Bank of Spur sits on the east side of the square. Its location close to the Royale is not a coincidence. A gold-trimmed door is proof of the success of this branch of the Spurian bank and those who run it.  An elegant gold-trimmed walnut door, an open emerald steel door, a street lantern, and a new rosewood sign pointing southeast are here.

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.  A marble statue of a Human, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a rosewood sign, a crisp gold lettered vellum notice, a flowing white marble fountain, a shimmering marble statue of a Dragon, a short wooden stick, and a closed small hardened leather sheath are here.

[Town Square Center.]

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.  A marble statue of a Human, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a rosewood sign, a crisp gold lettered vellum notice, a flowing white marble fountain, a shimmering marble statue of a Dragon, a short wooden stick, and a closed small hardened leather sheath are here.

The traffic on the northern street heading away from town square is an eclectic bunch.  Those who belong to the guilds to the north travel in packs on their way to and from guild events.  It is not unusual to see a group of armored fighters passing a group of robed clerics, each heading in the opposite direction. The large temple of Rinanni rises to the north, its white marble almost glowing in the light.  A street lantern and a fluffy white layer of snow are here.

Beds of wildflowers line the carefully placed cobblestones along this street. A pair of love birds, cooing in delight, sit upon a white marble bench. The giggles and laughs of a pair of trysting lovers echoes from the room in the Traveler's Hostel to the east. It is certain that Rinanni looks down upon this scene with delight.  A white marble bench and a street lantern are here.

A peaceful bliss pervades the very core of this guilded path. Below a large oak tree a couple of Rinannian priestesses sing lightly in Secti. Several merchants pause to listen to the song. Even a few hardened warriors cannot help but smile at the sweet melody.  A large oak tree, an open dragon-etched emerald door, and a street lantern are here.

A large stone building rises just to the east of Northern Avenue. These barracks house those known as Dread Knights. It is not unusual to see patrols of this elite group heading down the street towards Town Square. One would hope their presence would allow everyone to live in peace. If only they would stop fingering their swords all the time, you might believe it yourself.  A street lantern is here.

The activity at the main door of the guild is mind numbing as hundreds of citizens and merchants alike rush in and out of the guild to handle their business. While the governor has control over the city guard, many claim it is the Merchant's Guild that runs the city of Spur.  An open exquisite polished mahogany door and a street lantern are here.

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.  A marble statue of a Human, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a rosewood sign, a crisp gold lettered vellum notice, a flowing white marble fountain, a shimmering marble statue of a Dragon, an open small hardened leather sheath, a short wooden stick, and a short wooden stick are here.

The activity at the main door of the guild is mind numbing as hundreds of citizens and merchants alike rush in and out of the guild to handle their business. While the governor has control over the city guard, many claim it is the Merchant's Guild that runs the city of Spur.  An open exquisite polished mahogany door and a street lantern are here.

The large temple of Rinanni rises to the north, its white marble almost glowing in the light.  A street lantern and a fluffy white layer of snow are here.

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.

The well maintained road is lined with small brass lanterns, each swinging off an individual pole.  A street lantern is here.

Southern Avenue leads between the center of Spur and the homes of the prosperous and wealthy.

Vast estates tower over the huge Spurian wall towards the south. The well-to-do who live in these homes idle away their days, enjoying the luxury of time. Standing next to a very empty lantern pole, a small Flerian child insists in a plaintive wail, that he had nothing to do with the missing lantern. The well-dressed guard that interrogates him keeps pointing at a small sack on the ground and its obvious contents.  An open small burlap sack, a street lantern, and a lantern are here.

[Town Square Center.]

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.  A marble statue of a Human, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a rosewood sign, a crisp gold lettered vellum notice, a flowing white marble fountain, a shimmering marble statue of a Dragon, an open small hardened leather sheath, a short wooden stick, a short wooden stick, and a broken flaming oil lamp are here.

The boughs of a large apple tree hang over the well tended avenue. Below the beautiful tree stands a small fountain. Atop the fountain is an intricately carved Secian who appears to be dancing with the water as it splashes around her. Set in the marble base is a small plaque that reads, "For those who have gone before us." Many stand for a moment as they pass this way, giving thanks for the gift of life that is given by both the apple tree and the Secians of long ago. Large piles of dirt and broken stone lay on either side of the street as workmen ready the east and west alleys for expansion.  A street lantern, an open Secian etched moonsilver door, a pair of open silver forged swinging doors, and a sign above the doors are here.

Standing next to the large iron gate that separates the center of town from those of the elite class are several of the Spurian Guard. They are here to assist all who pass with the simple kindness of opening a gate, or the more important task of escorting those in need to the bank or market. A young looking cadet rubs wax into the stones of the city wall, his task is daunting, but one that will teach him discipline.  An open iron gate and a street lantern are here.

An elegant, carved wooden sign hangs above the ornate gateway set into the massive wall that divides Spurs Noble District from the Town Square. You can make out city guardsmen peering down attentively at all that approach from their posts atop the imposing wall. They seem to take a greater interest in this part of town, though there does not seem to be anything threatening enough here to warrant such attention.

An unusually large home, even for this part of town, lies off to the west. It seems as if one ambitious owner is slowly buying up the lots next to his and adding them to his own. Groundskeepers are at work in the surrounding gardens, trimming and raking, so intent on their work they do not bother to acknowledge the passing traffic on the road.  A street lantern is here.

Some of these names could almost be considered famous.  A street lantern is here.

Noble Way continues to wind its way among the rather modestly sized, but elegant, homes of the Spur's successful. Many a peasant farmer may live in homes larger than these, but none can match the quality found here. A peaceful, luxurious feeling pervades this part of town; perhaps it is the drifting floral scents wafting from the well-tended gardens.

Gazing down each of the nearby private drives reveals a glimpse of a luxurious home, each a miniature estate in its own right.

Leaving the exceptionally wealthy estates of the Spurian nobility, Noble Way heads toward the Town Square to the northwest. Along the roadside can be seen the in-city homes of successful merchants and other wealthy citizens of the Spur. The homes display a slightly different style, perhaps they are not quite so restrained; a touch more exuberance and freedom with materials is displayed.  A street lantern is here.

The entire avenue is composed of fine cobblestone, each level with its neighbor, providing a smooth ride for passing carriages and horses.

Numerous trees lining the avenue serve as the dividing border between the majestic estates of the nobility and the lightly traveled roadway.

However, they are no easier to access, still protected by their own guarding walls, some covered with ivy or colorful blooming vines.  A street lantern is here.

An exotic blend of shrubs and bushes glorify both sides of this short avenue. Starting at only a few feet tall, they slowly gain in height as they line the road to the west, reaching well over man-height at the distant archway that marks the entrance to Spur Park. To the side of the road is an open small gate. It has the look of a private residence.  An open small iron gate and a street lantern are here.

                        -------------------------------------------

                                    Visualization #1 is:
A Temple. The Temple. Not surrounded by satellite buildings of faith, but part and parcel of the bustling city life. Archways and buttresses soar toward the heavens, creamy white marble reflecting all light.

                                    Visualization #2 is:
The elegant Hotel Royale towers above the street, its emerald door sparkling in the light. The patrons that stroll in and out are catered to, doors opened and closed for them, and baggage and packages carried by harried servants. The large Bank of Spur sits on the east side of the square. Its location close to the Royale is not a coincidence. A gold-trimmed door is proof of the success of this branch of the Spurian bank and those who run it.

                                    Visualization #3 is:
The latticework surrounding and covering the spiral staircase is finely crafted. The intertwining beams seem to weave a delicate pattern above you, accenting the view of the forest floor. Soft, new, growth can be seen all over the forest below. A small mound of moss has slowly begun to cover the old inn, creating a fuzzy green mound. A large pile of Elven rope sits near the silent Golem. This creature of Elindale helps defend the city by retrieving the rope that people have pushed down to the forest below.

A vast grassy plain stretches out before you. In the distance you can see a group of oliphants, and another larger group of deer grazing in peace. Several lanky trees grow in front of the outer city wall, giving comfortable shade for creatures to relax in. Under one of the larger trees a lioness watches her cubs rough housing in the tall grass, carefully making sure they don't wander off and get into mischief.  Some sweet green grass, a tiny maidenhair sapling, and a small red and white ring of mushrooms are here.

A verdant field of grass spreads out before you. A large tree sits in the middle, its low slung branches brimming with tasty, ripe, fruit. A small herd of goats graze on the grass, occasionally finding a fruit treat to share. Several wild horses nibble on the higher branches, causing fruit to drop to the ground. As each piece hits the grass, one member of a raccoon family hastily grabs it and runs down to the pond to wash it carefully.  A finely crafted wooden bridge and a large juicy redfruit are here.

Pooling water is held back by a nicely crafted dam. Beavers are busy at work, creating an architectural masterpiece, while their cousins, the otters, enjoy a frolic in the deep cold water. Small animals spend their afternoon on the banks of the small stream that trickles out past the beaver dam, drinking their fill of the cool clear water, and cleaning their food for consumption. A finely crafted wooden bridge allows for travel across the water for all of Elindale's creatures.  A finely crafted wooden bridge is here.

A small, carefully tended cottage looks out across the verdant fields and the babbling creek. On the porch a little old lady sits and rocks slowly, carefully watching her charges. In the well fenced yard, pups of all ages and sizes run around chasing not only each other, but quite often their own tails. In the shade of the quiet porch, several cats preen. They carefully clean their fur, and watch over the antics of the dogs in the yard, knowing they are far superior and would never be caught acting so foolish.  A closed light green wooden door is here.

Standing sentinel over the animals is the largest tree that you have ever seen. Its branches stretch far into the sky, allowing creatures of all types to seek sanctuary within them. Chirps and chitters float down from above as a soft breeze rustles its leaves. The tree's magnificent presence spreads peace and tranquility over the entire area.  An open glistening white gate is here.

Calls of various animals fill the air as you move past the glistening white gate before you. From inside the fenced off yard, you can see a massive tree towering high up into the sky to the point it almost reaches the top of the city walls above. Below the tree you can see what looks to be like a small cabin beside a clear glistening pond. It is within the gates at the Elindalian animal sanctuary that the citizen's furry (and not so furry) friends can find safe haven. Many a companion wanders back and forth at the gate looking for their master or friend to return and get them.  An open glistening white gate and a street lantern are here.

A small brick building rises up before you, everything about it seems to give off a welcoming feeling from within. Occasionally, a person wanders out of the doors carrying a paper in their hands, their noses stuck between the pages so far that each of them nearly runs into you in passing! The sign hanging over the door is carved out of an ancient oak and looks to have been burnt slightly by some sort of fire. The sign reads, "The Dragon Fire Chronicles".  An open elegant antique oak door, a street lantern, and an oak and brick stall are here.

Though the feeling of peace that flows through this entire district is not lost, the relative sense of quiet is totally demolished upon walking past the doors of the nearby store. From within you can hear the horrible sounds of would be musicians playing their versions of such Spurian favorites as "Chunky Stone Potina" and "The Lost Soul Song." It's nothing short of a miracle the owner of the store can stand listening to the horrid attempts of untrained musicians all day. Perhaps it's punishment for breaking some sort of noise ordinance...  A pair of open double applewood doors and a street lantern are here.

You stand below the massive city walls where they separate the guild district from the art and music district. Many of the city's less serious folk spend time in the area, wandering around enjoying the pleasant atmosphere or catching a performance from one of the traveling shows. Through the gate you can see the guild district bustling with its day-to-day activity, a far cry from these peaceful and quiet streets. As if trying to perfectly define the feeling that resides within the district, a monk has erected a small hut in honor of the martial arts where negative energy is turned back into positive with every motion of the body.  An open shiny steel gate, an open ancient weathered door, and a street lantern are here.

Music of all kinds can be heard squeaking out of different windows on the floors of the building. At the front door an Usil Elf strums a harp and sings out, softly greeting all who pass or wishing a good day to those leaving.

The crowd pushes up against one side of the street to the point it becomes difficult to breathe. At first it seems the street is just extremely full. A quick realization sets in as you notice a massive mob of Flerians has set up behind a table on the opposite side of the street. A hastily written sign hangs from the table that reads, "Spurian Map Guild".  A street lantern is here.

The activity at the main door of the guild is mind numbing as hundreds of citizens and merchants alike rush in and out of the guild to handle their business. While the governor has control over the city guard, many claim it is the Merchant's Guild that runs the city of Spur.  An open exquisite polished mahogany door and a street lantern are here.

The distant glimmer from a temple made of white marble and pearl catches your eye. An intricate gilded iron gate and a small winding path are all that separate you from the dazzling temple of Rinanni. Majestic marble statues of doves in flight stand on either side of the gate.

The traffic on the northern street heading away from town square is an eclectic bunch.  Those who belong to the guilds to the north travel in packs on their way to and from guild events.  It is not unusual to see a group of armored fighters passing a group of robed clerics, each heading in the opposite direction. The large temple of Rinanni rises to the north, its white marble almost glowing in the light.  A street lantern and a fluffy white layer of snow are here.

Two elegant buildings, one to the north and one to the west, stand on either side of a quickly degrading road.

A dark pallor of smoky air hangs heavily over the area.  A street lantern is here.

You have entered the somber insurance headquarters of the House of the Dead. Richly appointed furnishings indicate that these services are refused by few. An elegant sign over a massive desk details available services. The presence of some inexplicable power sets your nerves on end. This is no place for hostility.   A wooden sign, a pitch black portal, and a pitch black portal are here.

Two elegant buildings, one to the north and one to the west, stand on either side of a quickly degrading road. Nattily dressed patrons of the two establishments hurry to their destination, not pausing for fear of being robbed, or worse. To the northwest the houses steadily become more decrepit. A dark pallor of smoky air hangs heavily over the area.  A street lantern is here.

[Town Square Center.]

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.  A marble statue of a Human, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a rosewood sign, a crisp gold lettered vellum notice, a flowing white marble fountain, and a shimmering marble statue of a Dragon are here.

The outward appearance of the people here seems a bit classier. Rich clothing and large coin purses are prevalent amongst the travelers. In fact, many of the folk heading into Town Square from the south are accompanied by large bodyguards to assure their safety. The well maintained road is lined with small brass lanterns, each swinging off an individual pole.  A street lantern is here.

Vast estates tower over the huge Spurian wall towards the south. The well-to-do who live in these homes idle away their days, enjoying the luxury of time. Standing next to a very empty lantern pole, a small Flerian child insists in a plaintive wail, that he had nothing to do with the missing lantern. The well-dressed guard that interrogates him keeps pointing at a small sack on the ground and its obvious contents.  An open small burlap sack, a street lantern, and a lantern are here.

The boughs of a large apple tree hang over the well tended avenue. Below the beautiful tree stands a small fountain. Atop the fountain is an intricately carved Secian who appears to be dancing with the water as it splashes around her. Set in the marble base is a small plaque that reads, "For those who have gone before us." Many stand for a moment as they pass this way, giving thanks for the gift of life that is given by both the apple tree and the Secians of long ago. Large piles of dirt and broken stone lay on either side of the street as workmen ready the east and west alleys for expansion.  A street lantern, an open Secian etched moonsilver door, a pair of open silver forged swinging doors, and a sign above the doors are here.

Standing next to the large iron gate that separates the center of town from those of the elite class are several of the Spurian Guard. They are here to assist all who pass with the simple kindness of opening a gate, or the more important task of escorting those in need to the bank or market. A young looking cadet rubs wax into the stones of the city wall, his task is daunting, but one that will teach him discipline.  An open iron gate and a street lantern are here.

An unusually large home, even for this part of town, lies off to the west. It seems as if one ambitious owner is slowly buying up the lots next to his and adding them to his own. Groundskeepers are at work in the surrounding gardens, trimming and raking, so intent on their work they do not bother to acknowledge the passing traffic on the road.  A street lantern is here.

Some of these names could almost be considered famous.  A street lantern is here.

The homes display a slightly different style, perhaps they are not quite so restrained; a touch more exuberance and freedom with materials is displayed.  A street lantern is here.

A well-guarded gateway separates the city's residential district from the farmlands just beyond. Guards carefully eye all that enter or exit the city, beckoning gruffly to random travelers for a closer inspection. The structure of the guards' barracks is visible above the road to the west. A weathered wooden sign is posted by the gate.  A closed iron gate, a wooden sign, a street lantern, an open thick stone door, and a fluffy white layer of snow are here.

[Noble Way.]

The occasional locked gate marks the entrance to some of the more hidden estates of Spurs nobility. From this broad avenue, little can be seen of their splendor. Behind the imposing gate recedes a proud drive, disappearing mysteriously into the trees. If not for the large imposing tower rising above the hedges it would be hard to discern anything was beyond the gate. It is apparent the residents do not wish to be disturbed.  A street lantern, a closed morbius door, and an open black iron gate are here.

Majestic elms continue to line this broad roadway, sheltering the avenue on both sides and further enhancing the grandiose atmosphere. Fronting the beautiful homes, cobbled paths edged with narrow flower beds meander through nearby private gardens. Though they appear wonderful places to spend an afternoon or take a picnic, the glances from those tending the estates makes it clear they are only for the invited.  A street lantern is here.

A small roadway bordered by flowering hedges bisects the wide avenue of Noble Way at a right angle, heading east to west.  A thick, sturdy sign stands just off to the side of a charming path, its large friendly letters intent on luring travelers into the city's premiere roadstay, the Gilded Lion Inn. The entrance is clearly marked and welcoming, extending off to the southeast.  A wooden sign and a street lantern are here.

Numerous trees lining the avenue serve as the dividing border between the majestic estates of the nobility and the lightly traveled roadway.

However, they are no easier to access, still protected by their own guarding walls, some covered with ivy or colorful blooming vines.  A street lantern is here.

The avenue comes to a fork, with Noble Way curving from south to the northwest.

Leaving the exceptionally wealthy estates of the Spurian nobility, Noble Way heads toward the Town Square to the northwest.

The homes display a slightly different style, perhaps they are not quite so restrained; a touch more exuberance and freedom with materials is displayed.  A street lantern is here.

The boughs of a large apple tree hang over the well tended avenue. Below the beautiful tree stands a small fountain. Atop the fountain is an intricately carved Secian who appears to be dancing with the water as it splashes around her. Set in the marble base is a small plaque that reads, "For those who have gone before us." Many stand for a moment as they pass this way, giving thanks for the gift of life that is given by both the apple tree and the Secians of long ago. Large piles of dirt and broken stone lay on either side of the street as workmen ready the east and west alleys for expansion.  A street lantern, an open Secian etched moonsilver door, a pair of open silver forged swinging doors, and a sign above the doors are here.

Vast estates tower over the huge Spurian wall towards the south. The well-to-do who live in these homes idle away their days, enjoying the luxury of time. Standing next to a very empty lantern pole, a small Flerian child insists in a plaintive wail, that he had nothing to do with the missing lantern. The well-dressed guard that interrogates him keeps pointing at a small sack on the ground and its obvious contents.  An open small burlap sack, a street lantern, and a lantern are here.

[Magick Lane & Rehas Way.]

You are just inside the gateway between the Magick District and the Town Square. These gates stand open at all hours of the day or night. An otherwise unremarkable door is glorified by the sign of the city's healer posted beside it.  A wooden door and a street lantern are here.

A massive circular stone platform stands to the side of Magick Lane, strangely entrancing runes carved on every inch of its sides. The symbol of the god Sa, a golden Dragon, fills the space along the top. Raw power and magick seem to flow from the platform, making the air around it crackle with energy. A small sign stands next to the platform with a single word written upon it.  A rune covered platform, a floating blue ruby staircase leading down, and a street lantern are here.

A low slung building resides on the west side of the street. Chanting can be heard from within.  Occasionally a few sparks rise into the sky, or some unwarranted raindrops begin, but they quickly are quelled.

A squat ugly little shack stands somber on the eastern side of this well swept lane. The occasional high pitched cackle sounds out from the shack, garnering strange looks from all who pass by. A mysterious gothic structure rises up on the opposite side of the street, the occasional explosion thundering out from within its doors, followed by muffled curses and breaking glass.  An open thick iron door, a closed ugly rotting door, a rotting oak sign, and a street lantern are here.

The occasional bright flash of light from inside the store suggests all kinds of strange and rare magicks are being cast inside! Those who walk past you glance at the rune shop warily and hurry to get past it as quickly as possible. A small sign hangs from the doorknob of the store that reads "Flerians not allowed!"

Drawn onto scrolls, carved into the wood finish of the building or crafted from any number of other materials, each of the different runes has its own strange feeling of excitement to it. The shop owner looks to know what every one of the runes does.  A large glowing sign, a wooden sign, an intricately carved oak door, and some flaming ruby ashes are here.

Welcome to Dragon's Gate, Glinka!

Good night! The heavens are obscured by the weather.
The weather is currently raining and winds are calm.

The area brightens.
[Elindale Animal Sanctuary.]

A vast grassy plain stretches out before you. In the distance you can see a group of oliphants, and another larger group of deer grazing in peace. Several lanky trees grow in front of the outer city wall, giving comfortable shade for creatures to relax in. Under one of the larger trees a lioness watches her cubs rough housing in the tall grass, carefully making sure they don't wander off and get into mischief.  Some sweet green grass, a tiny maidenhair sapling, and a small red and white ring of mushrooms are here.

This area is illuminated.
Obvious paths: southeast southwest.

The walls of this entry room are dead black, contrasting sharply with the bright yellow door. To the southeast, you hear unworldly howling and hissing, and to the southwest, you hear a silence so deathly that it is even scarier.  An open yellow door and an open soft burlap bag are here.

This room is illuminated.
In the room are Binx the Secian (holding a flaming tiny crimson dancing flame) and Romilin the Noble Psycian (holding a flaming moonsilver oil lamp).

Romilin just entered from the southwest.

A greater demon enters, following Romilin.

Binx whispers, "did you recover from the first time before you died?"

Blood drips from Romilin's eyes as Romilin writhes in pain from something deep inside attempting to tear itself out.

Slowly a number of wriggling, blood-covered bugs tear their way loose and crawl out of Romilin's mouth and nose. They tumble to the ground at Romilin's feet.

                                    Visualization #1 is:
A Temple. The Temple. Not surrounded by satellite buildings of faith, but part and parcel of the bustling city life. Archways and buttresses soar toward the heavens, creamy white marble reflecting all light.

                                    Visualization #2 is:
The elegant Hotel Royale towers above the street, its emerald door sparkling in the light. The patrons that stroll in and out are catered to, doors opened and closed for them, and baggage and packages carried by harried servants. The large Bank of Spur sits on the east side of the square. Its location close to the Royale is not a coincidence. A gold-trimmed door is proof of the success of this branch of the Spurian bank and those who run it.

                                    Visualization #3 is:
The latticework surrounding and covering the spiral staircase is finely crafted. The intertwining beams seem to weave a delicate pattern above you, accenting the view of the forest floor. Soft, new, growth can be seen all over the forest below. A small mound of moss has slowly begun to cover the old inn, creating a fuzzy green mound. A large pile of Elven rope sits near the silent Golem. This creature of Elindale helps defend the city by retrieving the rope that people have pushed down to the forest below.

To the west, tall grasses and scraggly trees obscure the view of a small town.  Creating a natural barrier to the east are rows of thorny hedges.  A haze of dark green can be seen to the northeast.

The trail skirts the border of the dismal marsh. Noxious vapors rise from the stagnant waters that lap at the noticeably narrowing route. What had been a dark green haze can now be distinguished as a massive forest.

Chittering noises come from overhead and tree branches dip and sway. A small brown shape scampers across the path, gone before it can be glimpsed and identified. The path disappears into a copse of saplings.  A thick copse of saplings is here.

[Brambles.]

Struggling through the underbrush, you make your way down the small trail only to be brought up short by an impenetrable wall of brambles. Plump red berries hang from the small branches of the bushes, guarded by long, sharp thorns. On a low hanging branch overhead, a watchful owl stares at you with golden eyes.  A slightly hidden trail, an ethereal looking owl, some fragrant red rose petals, and a large tangleroot thicket are here.

The footbridge that once connected this path to its match on the other side of the overflowing rushing river is now nothing more then a few charred pilings. Tiny insects buzz around their remains, finding a comfortable new home. Lashed to the remains of one of the more sturdy pilings is a tall steel pole. Wrapped around the pole, and tied securely is a taut rope. Bobbing ever so lightly due to the strain of the riverboat, the rope holds tight.  A flowing river, a freshly painted sign, some carved oak benches, and some tangleroot skin are here.

The path of four leaf clove shaped flagstones leads past a small clean shack and into a well formed tunnel through the thorn bushes to the east and the Caersech to the west. The small shack is set back from the road, its walls built of a whitewashed birch. A sturdy corral, filled with well-fed horses, stands to the left of the shack. A matched pair of dapple grays stand in front of the shack waiting to take their human baggage to their destination. To the left of the door, behind a small paned window, a beautiful Fir Elf female takes coin and in return, with a charming smile, directs those who have paid their fare into the waiting room.  A small shack, a freshly painted sign, a notice of non-refund, and a small winding stone pathway are here.

A small stream runs noisily under the two bridges spanning the ravine. A number of the brunt oaks still stand about, memorials to the forest this once was. A number of small saplings dot the ground between the black trunks. Between the stream bank and oaks, a small path of four-leaf-clover shaped stones weave a windy path through the forest.  A stone bridge, a wooden bridge, a clump of wildgrass, some flowering jasmine vines, and a fluffy white layer of snow are here.

Carefully winding its way up the base of the tree, and wrapping itself around the stairs, a flowering jasmine vine grows tall and lush. Dark scars from a past fire are almost hidden under tufts of fresh growth and moss. A large gap, nearly sixteen feet in distance, rests between the base of a set of stairs and the forest floor. A long moonsilver cord hangs down the side of the tree. If one pulls it, the long Elven rope will descend from above, allowing them to enter the great city of Treehaven. Bright green leaves of clover have begun springing up through the ashy soil in conjunction with soft moss to lend a durable cushion to this well-traveled spot.  Some vine-covered steps circling the tree, a freshly painted wooden sign, a healthy green patch of clover, a flowing marble fountain, some clover shaped stones, some sweet scented flowering jasmine vines, a long woven moonsilver cord, and a fluffy white layer of snow are here.

Soft moss has begun to grow on the platform and creates a soft walkway. A huge lump has begun to grow out of the tree. Someone has already decided to make this a nice spot to rest their potted plants and flowers on. Access to the Northern Tree, and the hidden tower to the west, are connected by living ropes of vines.  A vine bridge and a rope bridge are here.

A handful of planks huddle together to form a primitive, half-finished watch post. All appearances suggest that whatever work was planned will not be finished anytime soon. The sounds of the river beneath cause a cool, wet breeze to constantly flow about the branches of the tree.  A rope bridge is here.

Swollen beyond its banks, the once small creek is now a rushing overflowing river. What used to be the charred footbridge is now a safe haven for fish well down river, nothing left of its structure. Set well into the bank of the river is a long steel pole. Lashed to the pole is a heavy rope. The voice of the riverboat captain can be heard echoing across the water, taking command and moving his cargo.  A flowing river, a freshly painted sign, some carved oak benches, a large pool of mud, and a riverboat are here.

Tiny insects buzz around their remains, finding a comfortable new home. Lashed to the remains of one of the more sturdy pilings is a tall steel pole. Wrapped around the pole, and tied securely is a taut rope. Bobbing ever so lightly due to the strain of the riverboat, the rope holds tight.

Ravens dark as pitch spread their feathers to a wing-span of nearly four feet, so large they are, as they quarrel over an abandoned mule carcass on the roadside breaks out. How final death seems, so casually nature simply encompasses the bodies of the fallen, through carrion hunters or moldy decay. Yet through death there be life again, any number of these ravens being sustained through this death, so they may live. Perhaps only to become sustenance for one of the swamp creatures, who, in turn, spends its life continuing the cycle.

Small slimy creatures lie on the smooth stones near the water, darting into it at the speed of light as you near them with tiny splashes and echoing wakes blending into the small, gentle waves coming into the shore.

A hedge of spiky brambles forms a natural division from the lands and the swampy terrain to the south. Tall, limbless trees dot the horizon there, their bases lost in the misty depths of the gases hovering over the waters.
