[Town Square Center.]

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.  A flowing white marble fountain, a marble statue of a Human, a shimmering marble statue of a Dragon, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a rosewood sign, a crisp gold lettered vellum notice, a fluffy white layer of snow, a glistening white snow fort, and a pile of sparkling snow balls are here.

This area is illuminated.
You see the 1st city guard mage and the 2nd city guard mage.
In the area are Talishia the Noble Leuian, Karon the Drake (flying 15 feet above you), Azhure the San Elf, Gigi the Noble Leuian, Dathis the Noble Leuian, Kelthazod the San Elf, Polgar the Draco, Jyrayel the Noble Drake, and Tharalia the San Elf.

[Town Square South.]

The outward appearance of the people here seems a bit classier. Rich clothing and large coin purses are prevalent amongst the travelers. In fact, many of the folk heading into Town Square from the south are accompanied by large bodyguards to assure their safety. The well maintained road is lined with small brass lanterns, each swinging off an individual pole.  A street lantern and a fluffy white layer of snow are here.

This area is illuminated.
In the area are Karon the Drake (flying 15 feet above you) and Jyrayel the Noble Drake.
Obvious paths: north* northeast* east* south* west* northwest*.

You follow Karon south...

[Southern Avenue.]

Smooth stones make up the street that leads from the center of Spur to the south. Each stone has been carefully fitted for the most comfortable travel by both cart and traveler alike. A well dressed Guard patrols the area in his dress uniform. Captains don't allow for slovenly appearances on this patrol.  A street lantern is here.

[Southern Avenue.]

Southern Avenue leads between the center of Spur and the homes of the prosperous and wealthy. Several of the Ladies of the city stroll along the avenue chatting about the current events and latest gossip of the Spur. Behind them, harried servants carry their reticules and all those belongings that they cannot be without.  A street lantern is here.

[Southern Avenue.]

Vast estates tower over the huge Spurian wall towards the south. The well-to-do who live in these homes idle away their days, enjoying the luxury of time. Standing next to a very empty lantern pole, a small Flerian child insists in a plaintive wail, that he had nothing to do with the missing lantern. The well-dressed guard that interrogates him keeps pointing at a small sack on the ground and its obvious contents.  An open small burlap sack, a street lantern, and a lantern are here.

This area is illuminated.
You see the 1st old busybody.
In the area are Karon the Drake (flying 15 feet above you) and Jyrayel the Noble Drake.

You follow Karon south...

[Southern Avenue & Gorey Street.]

The boughs of a large apple tree hang over the well tended avenue. Below the beautiful tree stands a small fountain. Atop the fountain is an intricately carved Secian who appears to be dancing with the water as it splashes around her. Set in the marble base is a small plaque that reads, "For those who have gone before us." Many stand for a moment as they pass this way, giving thanks for the gift of life that is given by both the apple tree and the Secians of long ago. Large piles of dirt and broken stone lay on either side of the street as workmen ready the east and west alleys for expansion.  A street lantern, an open Secian etched moonsilver door, a pair of open silver forged swinging doors, and a sign above the doors are here.

[Southern Avenue.]

Standing next to the large iron gate that separates the center of town from those of the elite class are several of the Spurian Guard. They are here to assist all who pass with the simple kindness of opening a gate, or the more important task of escorting those in need to the bank or market. A young looking cadet rubs wax into the stones of the city wall, his task is daunting, but one that will teach him discipline.  An open iron gate and a street lantern are here.

You follow Karon through an open iron gate...

[Gateway.]

An elegant, carved wooden sign hangs above the ornate gateway set into the massive wall that divides Spurs Noble District from the Town Square. You can make out city guardsmen peering down attentively at all that approach from their posts atop the imposing wall. They seem to take a greater interest in this part of town, though there does not seem to be anything threatening enough here to warrant such attention.  A street lantern, an open iron gate, and a gilded silver plaque are here.

[Noble Way.]

To the north, you can make out an ornately scrolled gateway set in the base of the imposing city wall. The refined roadway of Noble Way stretches out to the south. The cobblestones of the road are smooth and even. The attention to detail shown here is a dramatic change from some of the other parts of the city.  A street lantern is here.

[Noble Way.]

An unusually large home, even for this part of town, lies off to the west. It seems as if one ambitious owner is slowly buying up the lots next to his and adding them to his own. Groundskeepers are at work in the surrounding gardens, trimming and raking, so intent on their work they do not bother to acknowledge the passing traffic on the road.  A street lantern is here.

Obvious paths: north* southwest*.

You follow Karon southwest...

[Noble Way.]

Many grand, even ostentatious, homes line this stretch of Noble Way. Most of the residents here were fortunate enough to be born into the right families. Few that live in this area have ever actually had to work for a living. Glancing at the nameplates reveals many of the recognizable names of the Spur. Some of these names could almost be considered famous.  A street lantern is here.

[Noble Way.]

Noble Way continues to wind its way among the rather modestly sized, but elegant, homes of the Spur's successful. Many a peasant farmer may live in homes larger than these, but none can match the quality found here. A peaceful, luxurious feeling pervades this part of town; perhaps it is the drifting floral scents wafting from the well-tended gardens.  A closed elegant black iron gate and a street lantern are here.

Gazing down each of the nearby private drives reveals a glimpse of a luxurious home, each a miniature estate in its own right. Short, stout walls and manicured hedges serve to keep out the riffraff and to protect the small, expensive gardens. Every detail has been attended to display the exotic plants, in all their pampered perfection.  A street lantern and a closed rosewood door are here.

You follow Karon southeast...

[Noble Way.]

Leaving the exceptionally wealthy estates of the Spurian nobility, Noble Way heads toward the Town Square to the northwest. Along the roadside can be seen the in-city homes of successful merchants and other wealthy citizens of the Spur. The homes display a slightly different style, perhaps they are not quite so restrained; a touch more exuberance and freedom with materials is displayed.  A street lantern is here.

[Intersection.]

The avenue comes to a fork, with Noble Way curving from south to the northwest. A side-street heading off to the east leads to an extremely well kept neighborhood that easily surpasses everything around it in splendor and magnificence. Everything, even the carefully pruned trees and the manicured shrubbery displays a desire for elegant perfection.  A street lantern is here.

[Noble Way.]

The entire avenue is composed of fine cobblestone, each level with its neighbor, providing a smooth ride for passing carriages and horses. The stones were customized by craftsmen, cut to order, rather than simply placed wherever they might fit. A few stately oaks and elms line the sides of the road, shading travelers during the daylight hours.  A street lantern is here.

Numerous trees lining the avenue serve as the dividing border between the majestic estates of the nobility and the lightly traveled roadway. The estates themselves are noticeably closer to the avenue than those to the south. However, they are no easier to access, still protected by their own guarding walls, some covered with ivy or colorful blooming vines.  A street lantern is here.

Occasional gates and driveways lead back into the well-kept estates of the city's nobility, breaking and adding interest to the defining plane of the walls lining Noble Way. The rest of the street seems to mimic the splendor of the estates beyond the wall. Swept and trimmed, the roadway exudes a simple, yet beautiful elegance.  A street lantern is here.

[Noble Crossroads.]

A small roadway bordered by flowering hedges bisects the wide avenue of Noble Way at a right angle, heading east to west.  A thick, sturdy sign stands just off to the side of a charming path, its large friendly letters intent on luring travelers into the city's premiere roadstay, the Gilded Lion Inn. The entrance is clearly marked and welcoming, extending off to the southeast.  A wooden sign and a street lantern are here.

[Governor's gate.]

The roadway ends at an artfully carved iron gate through which you can just glimpse the Governors Mansion in the distance. Smartly uniformed guards keep vigilant watch over any that intend to pass through. The entire place has an authoritative bearing, suitable for an official residence. There is a small sign posted off to one side.  A wooden sign and a street lantern are here.

[Park Road.]

An exotic blend of shrubs and bushes glorify both sides of this short avenue. Starting at only a few feet tall, they slowly gain in height as they line the road to the west, reaching well over man-height at the distant archway that marks the entrance to Spur Park. To the side of the road is an open small gate. It has the look of a private residence.  An open small iron gate and a street lantern are here.

[Entrance Path]

As you step through the gate, you find yourself on a small cobblestone path leading up to a small, seemingly abandoned cottage. The grass and weeds along the path are overgrown, a small bird's nest sits on the deck railing, and the entire roof is covered in a layer of impenetrable ivy.  An open small iron gate is here.

The boards creak under the weight of your feet on the stairs leading up to the main door.  A few small windows looking out over the park are visible from here, but are so dirty that you can't seem to see through them into the house.  The front door seems to be made of some sort of pine, but it is so old and decrepit you can't tell for sure.  An open decrepit pine door and some fresh dried blood are here.

[Small Cottage]

You find yourself in a sparse but well cared for entry hall, from what you can see it seems the inside of the cabin is much better tended for then the outside. Perhaps this is the summer home for some rich merchant or royalty? A thin layer of dust rests upon the hard wood floors, other then the occasional picture, it seems the owners of the cabin took everything including the drapes with them when they left.  An open decrepit pine door is here.

[Small Cottage]

This room seems to be a cross between a kitchen and a living room.  Empty shelves in the corner of the room sit waiting for the kitchen goods to be placed upon them.  On the floor you can see the outline where couches and chairs sat shading the wood beneath from the sun rays.  All in all, even without furniture, this room seems very cozy and alive.

[South Gate.]

A well-guarded gateway separates the city's residential district from the farmlands just beyond. Guards carefully eye all that enter or exit the city, beckoning gruffly to random travelers for a closer inspection. The structure of the guards' barracks is visible above the road to the west. A weathered wooden sign is posted by the gate.  A closed stone gate, a wooden sign, a street lantern, an open thick stone door, and a fluffy white layer of snow are here.

[Noble Way.]

The occasional locked gate marks the entrance to some of the more hidden estates of Spurs nobility. From this broad avenue, little can be seen of their splendor. Behind the imposing gate recedes a proud drive, disappearing mysteriously into the trees. If not for the large imposing tower rising above the hedges it would be hard to discern anything was beyond the gate. It is apparent the residents do not wish to be disturbed.  A street lantern, a closed morbius door, and an open black iron gate are here.

Majestic elms continue to line this broad roadway, sheltering the avenue on both sides and further enhancing the grandiose atmosphere.

Though they appear wonderful places to spend an afternoon or take a picnic, the glances from those tending the estates makes it clear they are only for the invited.  A street lantern is here.

A small roadway bordered by flowering hedges bisects the wide avenue of Noble Way at a right angle, heading east to west.  A thick, sturdy sign stands just off to the side of a charming path, its large friendly letters intent on luring travelers into the city's premiere roadstay, the Gilded Lion Inn. The entrance is clearly marked and welcoming, extending off to the southeast.  A wooden sign and a street lantern are here.

Occasional gates and driveways lead back into the well-kept estates of the city's nobility, breaking and adding interest to the defining plane of the walls lining Noble Way.

Numerous trees lining the avenue serve as the dividing border between the majestic estates of the nobility and the lightly traveled roadway. The estates themselves are noticeably closer to the avenue than those to the south. However, they are no easier to access, still protected by their own guarding walls, some covered with ivy or colorful blooming vines.  A street lantern is here.

The avenue comes to a fork, with Noble Way curving from south to the northwest. A side-street heading off to the east leads to an extremely well kept neighborhood that easily surpasses everything around it in splendor and magnificence. Everything, even the carefully pruned trees and the manicured shrubbery displays a desire for elegant perfection.  A street lantern is here.

Leaving the exceptionally wealthy estates of the Spurian nobility, Noble Way heads toward the Town Square to the northwest. Along the roadside can be seen the in-city homes of successful merchants and other wealthy citizens of the Spur. The homes display a slightly different style, perhaps they are not quite so restrained; a touch more exuberance and freedom with materials is displayed.  A street lantern is here.

Gazing down each of the nearby private drives reveals a glimpse of a luxurious home, each a miniature estate in its own right.

Noble Way continues to wind its way among the rather modestly sized, but elegant, homes of the Spur's successful. Many a peasant farmer may live in homes larger than these, but none can match the quality found here. A peaceful, luxurious feeling pervades this part of town; perhaps it is the drifting floral scents wafting from the well-tended gardens.

Groundskeepers are at work in the surrounding gardens, trimming and raking, so intent on their work they do not bother to acknowledge the passing traffic on the road.  A street lantern is here.

You can make out city guardsmen peering down attentively at all that approach from their posts atop the imposing wall. They seem to take a greater interest in this part of town, though there does not seem to be anything threatening enough here to warrant such attention.

Standing next to the large iron gate that separates the center of town from those of the elite class are several of the Spurian Guard. They are here to assist all who pass with the simple kindness of opening a gate, or the more important task of escorting those in need to the bank or market. A young looking cadet rubs wax into the stones of the city wall, his task is daunting, but one that will teach him discipline.  An open iron gate and a street lantern are here.

The boughs of a large apple tree hang over the well tended avenue. Below the beautiful tree stands a small fountain. Atop the fountain is an intricately carved Secian who appears to be dancing with the water as it splashes around her. Set in the marble base is a small plaque that reads, "For those who have gone before us." Many stand for a moment as they pass this way, giving thanks for the gift of life that is given by both the apple tree and the Secians of long ago. Large piles of dirt and broken stone lay on either side of the street as workmen ready the east and west alleys for expansion.  A street lantern, an open Secian etched moonsilver door, a pair of open silver forged swinging doors, and a sign above the doors are here.

Vast estates tower over the huge Spurian wall towards the south. The well-to-do who live in these homes idle away their days, enjoying the luxury of time. Standing next to a very empty lantern pole, a small Flerian child insists in a plaintive wail, that he had nothing to do with the missing lantern. The well-dressed guard that interrogates him keeps pointing at a small sack on the ground and its obvious contents.  An open small burlap sack, a street lantern, and a lantern are here.

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.  A flowing white marble fountain, a marble statue of a Human, a shimmering marble statue of a Dragon, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a rosewood sign, a crisp gold lettered vellum notice, a fluffy white layer of snow, a glistening white snow fort, and a pile of sparkling snow balls are here.

Many people crowd the narrow Bazaar Path, either heading towards the infamous Bazaar, or forcing their way back towards Trade Way. For a small price, a farmer can rent a booth and directly market his goods. Both some of the best and some of the worst deals can be made within this collection of stalls. The tall wall of Spur looms high to the east, and many of the guards take an early peek into the carts and the goods coming to market.  A street lantern is here.

Several large carts head west, full of various items the owners are sure will sell for a decent profit. Empty carts, the sign of a prosperous day, head east. An old Thugian pulls and pushes a very stubborn donkey. Neither end seems to be cooperating with his demands. Two small children dance around the Thugian and the donkey, chanting and singing a nasty song. Quickly, he takes out a switch, which is enough encouragement for both the donkey to move and the children to run.  A street lantern is here.

The bottleneck of carts, merchants and buyers block any exit out of the Bazaar to the north. While it is easy to travel with traffic, trying to move against it is impossible.

To the northeast a small tent can barely be seen hiding behind the stalls.  A white silk tent and a street lantern are here.

The well-defined Bazaar path heads off to the west. This corner is a mix of the old and the new. On one corner an old stall is barely standing. The roof has caved in, and it quickly becomes apparent that this location has become a local dump. Pieces of wood that look suspiciously like some of the leftovers from other construction sites are piled on top of rotting offal. On the opposite corner a new tent is being erected, its high roof and vivid coloring pleasing to the eye.  An open stall and a street lantern are here.

A long wooden stall is set here between the Bazaar path and the large barracks which house the Spurian guard. Hanging from the front of the rickety wooden roof are furs of every type. The merchant inside is rumored to give good prices for pelts, hides, and animal parts.  A tanned leather sign, an open sturdy fur-lined stall, and a street lantern are here.

A new stall has been hastily constructed on this site, in the shadow of the large Spurian Wall. Most chose to build well within the Bazaar as opposed to this outer path. Low-grade wood and bent nails make up this sorry excuse for a business establishment. A small sign on the front has a crude picture of a key on it, and the name, "Skugz."  A crooked wooden sign, a weathered dark wooden stall, and a broken street lantern are here.

A heavy odor of unwashed sweaty bodies assails you as you enter this rickety establishment. A short Go-blin-al scurries around in the shadows behind the counter. A variety of keys hang behind his counter, establishing this as a locksmith shop. He mumbles, as if to himself, "Heehee ... chests! Lots chests ... yeeees ... picky picky picky! Hee hee! Me unlock 'em, yeeees ... hee hee!"

Two large Oog-ra guards refuse to allow anyone to continue south. With loud gestures and over exaggerated pointing, they send wagons to the east or back north. With some slapping of backs, and happy grins, they congratulate themselves on following directions. A yell is heard from the south as Skugz screams, "Keep meee dooor clear...yes yeees...keep it clear." It is a wonder that he hasn't figured out they are turning away his customers.

A slinky dressed female San Elf preens and giggles garnering the attention of several humans leaning out the window of the guards' quarters. Catcalls and whistles abound as she shows more thigh then is warranted. A wagon driver, distracted by the view, almost drives into a cart coming the opposite direction. Shouts are exchanged and fists shaken, as the San female snickers at all those involved.  A street lantern is here.

Bazaar Path follows the line of the Spurian Wall. High above you can hear orders being barked and guards marching in rhythm. The closeness of the wall to the path has essentially blocked any breeze that might waft through the area. The stagnant air holds in the smells of food, incense and lots of bodies. It is not unusual to see the cart drivers with triangles of cloth pulled up over their nose and mouths.  A street lantern is here.

Several large carts head west, full of various items the owners are sure will sell for a decent profit. Empty carts, the sign of a prosperous day, head east. An old Thugian pulls and pushes a very stubborn donkey. Neither end seems to be cooperating with his demands. Two small children dance around the Thugian and the donkey, chanting and singing a nasty song. Quickly, he takes out a switch, which is enough encouragement for both the donkey to move and the children to run.  A street lantern is here.

The foot traffic on Bazaar Path turns south down a small trail into the heart of the Bazaar. Many of the smaller carts follow the buyers and merchants to avoid the conflicts with the larger wagons that continue west.

Bazaar Path makes a sudden left hand turn, following the direction of the large Spurian Wall. Carts and wagons creak in protest as their heavy loads shift precariously.  Waiting for that rare item to fall from one of the merchant carts, several small Flerian children play in the dust at the side of the road.  A street lantern is here.

The going slows down briefly as someone stops dead in their tracks. Every so often one feels the need to take in the sounds and smells that are uniquely the Bazaar.

Further passage along Bazaar Path is blocked occasionally by brawling peasants.

Many people crowd the narrow Bazaar Path, either heading towards the infamous Bazaar, or forcing their way back towards Trade Way. For a small price, a farmer can rent a booth and directly market his goods. Both some of the best and some of the worst deals can be made within this collection of stalls. The tall wall of Spur looms high to the east, and many of the guards take an early peek into the carts and the goods coming to market.  A street lantern is here.

[Town Square Center.]

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.
