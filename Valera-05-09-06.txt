The city walls tower high above you at the entrance to the guild district. On top of the wall, a very bored looking guard with a lazy eye watches those passing through the gate. The large guild buildings spread out around the district, bustling with the day-to-day activity of the city's guild groups.  An open iron gate and a street lantern are here.

Northern Avenue ends at a gateway set within the massive city walls. On the other side of the gate are the Guild Halls. Those who pass through accept the bond of peace that the Guilds impose on all who desire their services. On either side of the gate guards stand at attention saluting all those who pass by.  An open iron gate, an open thick stone door, and a street lantern are here.

A large stone building rises just to the east of Northern Avenue. These barracks house those known as Dread Knights. It is not unusual to see patrols of this elite group heading down the street towards Town Square. One would hope their presence would allow everyone to live in peace. If only they would stop fingering their swords all the time, you might believe it yourself.  A street lantern is here.

The distant glimmer from a temple made of white marble and pearl catches your eye. An intricate gilded iron gate and a small winding path are all that separate you from the dazzling temple of Rinanni. Majestic marble statues of doves in flight stand on either side of the gate. The gaze of their peaceful eyes seems to follow your every movement.  An open intricately gilded iron gate, a pair of pure white marble dove statues, and a street lantern are here.

A peaceful bliss pervades the very core of this guilded path. Below a large oak tree a couple of Rinannian priestesses sing lightly in Secti. Several merchants pause to listen to the song. Even a few hardened warriors cannot help but smile at the sweet melody.  A large oak tree, an open dragon-etched emerald door, and a street lantern are here.

Beds of wildflowers line the carefully placed cobblestones along this street. A pair of love birds, cooing in delight, sit upon a white marble bench. The giggles and laughs of a pair of trysting lovers echoes from the room in the Traveler's Hostel to the east. It is certain that Rinanni looks down upon this scene with delight.  A white marble bench and a street lantern are here.

[Town Square Center.]

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.  A marble statue of a Human, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a rosewood sign, a crisp gold lettered vellum notice, a flowing white marble fountain, and a shimmering marble statue of a Dragon are here.

Two elegant buildings, one to the north and one to the west, stand on either side of a quickly degrading road.

A darkly clad hoodlum leans against a worn street sign. He eyes those who pass by very carefully and then makes a few gestures into the shadows. All who are forced to travel upon this road have learned to keep one hand on their coin purse, the other on their weapon, and their wits about them.

Low Street is the thoroughfare that carries people to the northwestern portion of Spur. The traffic along this road leans towards those without any viable economic means. Women who look older then their years, crippled old men and darkly clad shadowy figures all move stoically towards their destination. Only the plodding of worn shoes breaks the dismal silence.

A beggar lies in a large pile of trash snoring deeply. His clothing is torn, filthy dirty, and a strong smell of alcohol wafts off of him. Sniffing around in the garbage, a hound looks for any scrap that can be eaten. The pup nudges the beggar and begins to rummage through the trash that he is using for bedding.

Potholes and cracks in the road impede travel on this portion of Low Street. Maintenance is not considered a priority, due to the roads distance from the center of the city. Unimpeded by the poor condition of the street, several people gather around a nearby newsstand, reading the latest issue of the Spurian Free Press and discussing politics. Across the street from the newsstand a sign next to a weathered brown wooden door reads, "Spurian Free Press" in large, bold letters.   A street lantern, a closed weathered brown wooden door, and a wooden newsstand are here.

A rusty printing press, held together mostly by chicken wire and a prayer, dominates the center of the room. To one side, an elegant stained glass light fixture hangs over a long table that serves as a shared workspace for many of the staff. A frazzled looking Usil elf huddles at one end of the table, peering through thick glasses at a piece of parchment. Scattered at his feet are several heavily marked and crumpled papers.

An elegant gold-trimmed walnut door, an open emerald steel door, a street lantern, and a new rosewood sign pointing southeast are here.

[Town Square East.]

Travel to the eastern portion of Town Square finds battle clad warriors shoulder to shoulder with chained criminals and those who live outside the Spurian Walls. The cobblestones that line the street are stained with blood.  It is unknown as to whether the blood is from guards carrying out quick executions, or gladiators who refused to wait their turn for arena space.  A street lantern is here.

[Town Square North.]

The traffic on the northern street heading away from town square is an eclectic bunch.  Those who belong to the guilds to the north travel in packs on their way to and from guild events.  It is not unusual to see a group of armored fighters passing a group of robed clerics, each heading in the opposite direction. The large temple of Rinanni rises to the north, its white marble almost glowing in the light.  A street lantern and a fluffy white layer of snow are here.

Two elegant buildings, one to the north and one to the west, stand on either side of a quickly degrading road. Nattily dressed patrons of the two establishments hurry to their destination, not pausing for fear of being robbed, or worse. To the northwest the houses steadily become more decrepit. A dark pallor of smoky air hangs heavily over the area.  A street lantern is here.

A darkly clad hoodlum leans against a worn street sign. He eyes those who pass by very carefully and then makes a few gestures into the shadows. All who are forced to travel upon this road have learned to keep one hand on their coin purse, the other on their weapon, and their wits about them.  A faded wooden sign and a glowing street lantern are here.

[Low Street.]

Low Street is the thoroughfare that carries people to the northwestern portion of Spur. The traffic along this road leans towards those without any viable economic means. Women who look older then their years, crippled old men and darkly clad shadowy figures all move stoically towards their destination. Only the plodding of worn shoes breaks the dismal silence.  A street lantern is here.

A beggar lies in a large pile of trash snoring deeply. His clothing is torn, filthy dirty, and a strong smell of alcohol wafts off of him. Sniffing around in the garbage, a hound looks for any scrap that can be eaten. The pup nudges the beggar and begins to rummage through the trash that he is using for bedding.  A street lantern is here.

Potholes and cracks in the road impede travel on this portion of Low Street. Maintenance is not considered a priority, due to the roads distance from the center of the city. Unimpeded by the poor condition of the street, several people gather around a nearby newsstand, reading the latest issue of the Spurian Free Press and discussing politics. Across the street from the newsstand a sign next to a weathered brown wooden door reads, "Spurian Free Press" in large, bold letters.   A street lantern, a closed weathered brown wooden door, and a wooden newsstand are here.

Low Street ends at a gate that stands permanently ajar, its mechanism jammed and broken. Set in the massive city walls between Town Square and Spur's Poor Quarter, the gates rickety appearance befits that which lies behind it. Loud and colorful words, mixing with the sound of playing children can be heard from within.  An open iron gate and a street lantern are here.

Just inside the gate from Town Square, the intersection of Dismal and Dank streets meet into a corner. Whole sections of buildings are being ripped out, demolishing them piece by piece.

A large section of buildings on the west side of the street is now gone. The constant noises of construction and demolition pound away at all hours. The street is immaculately clean save the tons of stones piled along the poor quarter wall. The street stones extend westward, paving the beginnings of a large square shaped area. A tall stone building, painted a deep sable, rises against the poor quarter wall. Shabbily dressed people enter and exit the building rapidly. Many exit carrying bundles of papers. A faint haze of smoke drifts from the buildings doorway.  A pile of stones and an open wide smoke filled doorway are here.

The broken and shattered remains of the Temple of Set litter the road and the spot where the temple once stood. Beggars and poor folk stand staring forlornly at the remains. A few make their way through the broken gate, some crying and some showing no emotion at all. Offerings to Set have been placed all around and litter the area.  An open large wooden gate and some stairs are here.

An eagle-emblazoned hostel and a large school house stand out amidst the broken down houses. A small group of children gather around an adolescent boy with the face of an old man. He smirks at the children on their way to school, while his followers openly taunt them. A teacher takes a step toward the boy as if to shoo him away, but thinks better of it and retreats back into the school.  An open crudely marked door and an open schoolhouse door are here.

Dismal Lane meanders along between crowded buildings. Some appear to be uninhabited with windows and doors boarded over. Many of the other buildings have undergone some refurbishment and are fronted by freshly painted doors and windows. Around the base of the trees that have been planted along the street someone has planted rings of daisies. On the side of the street, a gang of young Thugians taunt a human child, pushing him back and forth. There is neither fear nor anger on the child's face, only dull, apathetic acceptance.  An open blue door, a scented lilac tree, a scented lilac tree, and some cheerful yellow and white daisies are here.

A ramshack looking building that seems to be almost leaning sideways stands out on the corner, a small dented sign hangs from above the swinging wooden doors that reads, "Tarnished Tankard Tavern and Inn". From the look of the patrons milling around outside, this is anything but a high class establishment.  A pair of broken swinging wooden doors are here.

Upon entering this small home one can see a low-lit fire crackling in the fireplace. It has a small cooking pot hanging over the flames sending a wonderful aroma of spices into the air. A small wooden rocking chair sits in the corner of the room unattended, but shows signs of its use by the scuffs in the neatly kept floor. The floor is a redwood and very appealing to the eyes and, also, has a small fur rug that sits in the middle of the floor. Next to the old chair one can see a sewing basket with a large needle sticking out of it, and a picture of a soldier sits on mantle of the fireplace.  A woven reed chair, a flaming cook fire, an open door, and a mysterious beaded curtain are here.

Her small pitch black eyes dart back and forth quickly, regarding each customer with careful mindfulness. She spits into her hands then rubs them together briskly with a glint in her eyes before she gestures slowly to her wares.  A blinking newt eye, a sparkling copper sconce, a mysterious beaded curtain, an old wooden stool, a short wooden counter, and a brightly painted headless snake are here.

Shadows dance across the floor and walls as sharp yellow flames flicker with the rushing wind. A long narrow tunnel stretches into a veil of shadows as shapes scamper in and out of the darkness and light.

High above, a steady stream of rushing water pours from a giant black hole in the large stone southern wall of this underground cavern. As the water falls, it crashes onto the floor but quickly flows over the edges of the small stone platform. A pathway of floating rocks leads through the underground river that swirls around the stone footholds. Shadows continue to taunt menacingly, playing tricks on the anxious mind. A large stone juts out from the platform into the cold waters below.  A giant jutting stone is here.

Dark eyes and quiet snickering pierce the darkness as a small rowboat, filled with a party of gobbies, patrols around the small island.

[Bedroom.]

A small fireplace sits in the corner of this small dark room. Dusty embers stir as a cool breeze blows in through the chimney, dispersing the delicate scent of fresh lavender and roses. A plush dark green velvet duvet blankets a queen-sized bed of cared pine, decorated with fine silk throw pillows. A freshly cut bouquet sits below a large window that looks out on a large icicle shaped stalagmite.  A shadowy black stone fireplace, an open flowery painted mahogany wardrobe, an open carved wooden door, a fragrant jar of flowers, and a velvet trimmed mahogany bed are here.

[Central Chamber.]

Glowing amber and crimson flames lick the air from a fire that rages inside the stone fireplace. As the wood crackles and pops, the fire stirs the air with a cozy warmth and a fragrant aroma of spices. Plush black satin pillows make a circle on the large fluffy brown rug that blankets most of the room. A reflection of the flames flickers in the ruby eyes of a black dragon head that hangs over the hearth of the room like a prized trophy.  Some black satin throw pillows, a blazing fireplace, an open carved wooden door, and a red wooden announcement board are here.

[Kitchen.]

A seasoned, sapphire blue Drag-al hums a festive Day of Shadows carol as he keeps time with his thumping tail. He swirls around the small kitchen as he stirs a boiling pot. A circle of young ruffians sit around a large table, slurping their soup and laughing about their most recent exploits. The Drag-al gives a welcoming wink and a polite nod to all visitors as they enter the kitchen of Dackari the famous bread and soup maker.  A fiery wood burning stove, an open painted wooden cupboard, a large circular wooden table, and some colorful wooden chairs are here.

[Tunnel.]

A loud, "Boooo!" echoes down the corridor, followed by a jovial snickering. The stone walls are engraved with the heads of cobras and jackals. Their eyes flicker with the iron torches that burn along the wall. The floor quivers as uproarious laughter rings through the chambers. The laugher harmonizes as it rises from a large hole in the floor. Large puddles on the floor waver as a musty draft wafts through the air from the ceiling.  A crack in the wall is here.

[Fruits of Victory Shop.]

A Drag-al, grinning from ear to ear as he watches another customer "drop-in" greets you heartily and takes a few sips from his wine glass. He shows you the shops wares. Many tools of the trade can be bought, or the hard won 'fruits of victory' can be sold here at prices that are very reasonable indeed, at least to a Drag-al. A group of Drag-al children watch the hole above carefully as they fluff up a pillow then pull it away quickly as another customer drops by.

A loud, "Boooo!" echoes down the corridor, followed by a jovial snickering. The stone walls are engraved with the heads of cobras and jackals. Their eyes flicker with the iron torches that burn along the wall. The floor quivers as uproarious laughter rings through the chambers. The laugher harmonizes as it rises from a large hole in the floor. Large puddles on the floor waver as a musty draft wafts through the air from the ceiling.

A stream of stagnate water lies still at the bottom of this large circular pipe. In its depths, a large bull frog leaps a out of the way of approaching feet. Its sudden motion stirs up the settled silt, effectively making it impossible to see anything upon the watery bottom.  A ladder is here.

Small bubbles drift up from the murky floor, growing in size until they eventually burst upon the surface. A rotten smell escaping into the air. Nestled against the iron pipe wall, large audience of spiders have gathered in a intricately woven web, anticipating their next meal. Large mosquitoes skip across the air, dodging the silken snare. A Go-blin-al kneels beside a hole that leads to the north. He holds a long wooden stick with a stuffed rabbit tied on it through the hole.

You see a group of laborers hard at work repairing the walls to one of the many homes along the street. Even as you watch, a group of youngsters rush out and destroy the work they've already completed. They run away, laughing loudly as they throw a small piece of wood down a near-by well.  A flowery stone well is here.

The houses along this stretch of street alternate between run-down and freshly painted leaving most passersby wondering if the area is in decline or repair. Porches, stairs and roofs all show signs of recent work, newer materials set into the existing structure where holes have been repaired. The people in the street are as mixed as the houses, some shuffling listlessly along, others in clean, neat attire with a purposeful look. In the middle of the street a man has fallen, stricken with palsy. A young woman in a fresh white cleric's robe stops and helps him to his feet, offering to walk him to the hospital nearby.

Dismal Lane continues on a crooked path north and south. A side street branches to the west and is quickly lost in the shadows. A ramshack looking building that seems to be almost leaning sideways stands out on the corner, a small dented sign hangs from above the swinging wooden doors that reads, "Tarnished Tankard Tavern and Inn". From the look of the patrons milling around outside, this is anything but a high class establishment.  A pair of broken swinging wooden doors are here.

Dismal Lane meanders along between crowded buildings. Some appear to be uninhabited with windows and doors boarded over. Many of the other buildings have undergone some refurbishment and are fronted by freshly painted doors and windows. Around the base of the trees that have been planted along the street someone has planted rings of daisies. On the side of the street, a gang of young Thugians taunt a human child, pushing him back and forth. There is neither fear nor anger on the child's face, only dull, apathetic acceptance.  An open blue door, a scented lilac tree, a scented lilac tree, and some cheerful yellow and white daisies are here.

An eagle-emblazoned hostel and a large school house stand out amidst the broken down houses. A small group of children gather around an adolescent boy with the face of an old man. He smirks at the children on their way to school, while his followers openly taunt them. A teacher takes a step toward the boy as if to shoo him away, but thinks better of it and retreats back into the school.  An open crudely marked door and an open schoolhouse door are here.

A large section of buildings on the west side of the street is now gone. The constant noises of construction and demolition pound away at all hours. The street is immaculately clean save the tons of stones piled along the poor quarter wall. The street stones extend westward, paving the beginnings of a large square shaped area. A tall stone building, painted a deep sable, rises against the poor quarter wall. Shabbily dressed people enter and exit the building rapidly. Many exit carrying bundles of papers. A faint haze of smoke drifts from the buildings doorway.  A pile of stones and an open wide smoke filled doorway are here.

Potholes and cracks in the road impede travel on this portion of Low Street. Maintenance is not considered a priority, due to the roads distance from the center of the city. Unimpeded by the poor condition of the street, several people gather around a nearby newsstand, reading the latest issue of the Spurian Free Press and discussing politics. Across the street from the newsstand a sign next to a weathered brown wooden door reads, "Spurian Free Press" in large, bold letters.   A street lantern, an open weathered brown wooden door, and a wooden newsstand are here.

Low Street is the thoroughfare that carries people to the northwestern portion of Spur. The traffic along this road leans towards those without any viable economic means. Women who look older then their years, crippled old men and darkly clad shadowy figures all move stoically towards their destination. Only the plodding of worn shoes breaks the dismal silence.  A street lantern is here.

A pair of women carrying several shopping bags spin through the glass revolving doors while two grumpy looking men drag behind them with even larger bags. A large banner over the revolving doors proudly displays the name, "The Galleria", for all to see.   A street lantern and an open gold trimmed revolving glass door are here.

A coral altar, a misty grey pedestal of fog, a light golden oak tree, a light golden oak tree, an ancient greying steelwood gate, and a gold flecked coral tiger statue are here.

[Shrine of Unknown, Rune Chamber.]

Mysterious spiraling runes are etched upon the grey walls, which have an ethereal pearlescent quality about them. A simply clad cleric kneels upon a cushioned pad as he takes the hands of Unknown's clergy men and women in his own before pressing a misty grey tube against the skin of their arm. Billowy wisps of mist drift from the followers' arms and disappears into the air after a moment.  A simple cushioned pad is here.

[Unknown Temple Shop.]

Thick grey granite slabs are arranged into shelves forming a U-shape in this corner of the grove. A large piece of coral sits in the middle, supporting a tiger-etched glass case. The inside of the case is filled with a strangely glowing fog that rolls and twists, revealing various items arranged within. An ageless human dressed in soft grey robes embroidered with a row of question marks along the cuffs and hem shuffles between the shelves, murmuring quietly.

The wafting smell of flowers and trees float out from a well kept grey fence.  Old piles of rubble have been cleaned up and the glimpse of a sprawling park can be seen, having been planted in their stead. Beautiful and statuesque monuments dot the landscape through the gate, that remains locked, but has been festively decorated with a bright ribbon.  A street lantern, an open festive ribbon tied grey iron gate, and an ancient greying steelwood gate are here.

From the city gate to the west, Trade Way continues eastward towards the busy Merchant district, past Joyeusse's Shop. The air is thick with the scent of fresh flowers. Wagons filled with goods bound for sale trundle past, their drivers hopeful of the anticipated profits. Eager young warriors venture towards the west gate and the dangers beyond.

The relative safety inside Spur is a comfort to those returning from the fields and mountains. To those leaving, a massive wall of defense around the city lies ahead. Archer towers beside the gate overlook the wall, offering a painful welcome to would-be invaders. Several guards on foot patrol pass and disappear behind a thick, bluesteel banded steelwood door. Wall road stretches to the south, a wide passage between the city wall and several large buildings.  An open patched steelwood gate, an open thick stone door, a street lantern, and a fluffy white layer of snow are here.

Travelers from Rathan to the northwest, and the Trade Route to the south, converge at Spur's west gate. Guards posted on the ground give those seeking to enter the city a cursory once-over. Their lack of interest shows that anyone approaching has already been observed from above for some time. A grate in the ground loosens mud from wagon wheels and hooves before they pass through the gate, helping to keep the streets of Spur fairly clean.  An open giant patched steelwood gate, a giant green oak tree, a small blue pool, a thick oak grate over the pool, a polished stone marker, and a fluffy white layer of snow are here.

The path is flanked by countless tall oaks, swaying peacefully in the wind. They do their best to hide the sky from view, making it hard to tell night from day at times. Littering the area are pieces of broken wagon, bits of human remains and dried splotches of blood. The remnants of a violent fight lie all around you, whomever used to belong to the wagon is no more than vulture food.  A bloody severed foot is here.

In the dusty distance, Spur's great wall demarks the southern end of this well-traveled merchant's road. Soaring majestically to the north stands the spiky pinnacles and snow topped peaks of an epic mountain range so immense that it separates lands, races, and cultures. Connecting the two is a merchant road built long ago.

The noise and sputum of the big city stains the south eastern horizon through the vague outline of old-growth oaks, maples and cedars. This well traveled road transverses the flat terrain shouldered by weeds and vines and, due to the proximity of the city, small paths continuously cut through the road from either side.

Lush grass grows up to the borders of a thick, dense forest that cloaks the hills to the west. The grasslands thin near the grove as the huge trees completely shade the ground, and are replaced by taller bushes and juniper trees. The contrast between the waving stalks on the flat vista and the dark leaves of almost vertical trees is striking.

From the west spans a dark green forest of Sycamore and Beech trees that soak in the moister parts of the lower river valley. The tall, shaded forest breaks like a green tinged wave upon the tranquil calm of the grasslands. The huge trees within are ancient, reaching hundreds of feet into the air. As if steaming from a great cauldron, a heavy ground fog seeps from deep within the forest carrying with it the fresh smell of decomposing green matter.

A rickety criss-crossed rough beam fence pens the grazing of black and white cows whose ponderous forms are barely visible through the tall grass on either side of the road. To the north, the soft, undulating grassland floor of the wide valley succumbs to the rolling foothills, which in turn delineates the imposing outline of a vista-spanning mountain range. Many a traveler has witnessed this idyllic vantage point and has been drawn on to follow the road that travels into the heart of the mountains.

The road diverts around a small pool of murky water that lies to the north. A confusion of hoof prints muddies the shoreline where the placid bovines have come to water themselves. The pool is damned by a small hillock which allows no drainage so the pool remains stagnant. The mountains to the north reflect in perfectly upside-down symmetry on the still pond's surface, only wavering slightly in concentric circles to the deft touch of small insects.

Just to the north, the roadway curves gently around a bend in a large river that flows towards the southeast. An enormous smooth round rock splits off a small eddy from the main current resulting a deep, clear pool by the eastern side of the road. The cool calm water catches the reflection of the white snowcapped mountain range further up the valley while the river rushes past towards Spur. Five fishermen recline on folding chairs or against rocks, tethered by the silvery lines of their poles to the fishing hole. Each fisherman is spread evenly around the pool as if held apart by some invisible barrier as they eye the large shadowy fish shapes finning effortlessly against the mild current in the eddy.

The raging silver-cast river cuts through the grassland and heads southeast. Fishing boats, bearing the crest of the city of Spur, dart around several barges laden with exotic wares to trade in the merchant city. Most bear the purple livery of the city of Rathan, but every so often a ship flying unfamiliar colors can be sighted.

The massive stone bridge expands over the raging river, it's huge pilons buried deep in the river's bottom. Within sight and just downstream, the water rushes past what remains of the old bridge, causing dangerous under-currents. Bright red bouys mark the broken fragments locations and signs tell of the peril. The river pilots earn their pay negotiating this treacherous obstacle.

Mismatched mortar colors and varying types and cuts of the stone show the extent of the reconstruction made by quick working masons. A few proud workers chiseled their initials and the date into their handiwork, most reading the date of Rinannimas, 6th month, 61st day, year 313. Bright banners flutter in the breeze on both sides of the bridge as if in celebration of its victory over both the river's truculence and sabotage.

A massive stone bridge spans a raging grey tinted river as it runs it's course towards the southeast. The mud around the bridge footings has been churned by wheels of quarry wagons, tracks of sleds bearing block and tackle, shod hooves of draft beasts and booted feet of masons and bridge workers. The newer parts of the huge bridge are obvious due to the contrast in colors of mortar and rock. Bright banners snap briskly in the wind from both ends of the bridge.  A broken wooden wagon is here.

Withstanding seasonal floods and constant traffic, the durable road shows how affective good design and competent construction can be.

A brown and white osprey soars above the raging river, scanning the water for a meal. Suddenly, it dives down to the surface and snatches a rather large trout from the water. The trout wriggles helplessly in the large birds grip as it is carried off to a nest of sticks and twigs high in the distant treetops.

On the northern edge of the road stands a tall, flat rock. Chipped into the shape of a pillar and abraded to smoothness, it bears the stamped surveyor's mark of the road's builder. The mark's grooved letters are filled with sand and dust and obscured from age, but the arrows delineating north, south, east and west are clear and easy to read. The rest of the stamp is undecipherable and lends mystery to the road's origin.

Boulders stacked in pyramids contained by large timbers stand mutely to the side of the roadway next to an impromptu dump of broken tools, wooden stakes and empty buckets lined with mortar. Deeply grooved sled tracks lead to the east towards the bridge from this part of the road where the flatness of the valley was best suited for the staging area during the bridge's reconstruction. Smooth rectangles of tent foundations still mark their location in a semi circle around a blackened fire ring where the workers and their supervisors lived during it's rebuilding.

The decaying remains of the bridge workers camp sprawls across this flat valley. To house their draft beasts, the workers constructed small stalls and shelters from rickety boards nailed quixotically to the standing trees. Three brass ring topped posts lie sunk into the grasslands turf, to the south, which was most likely used for tethering grazing animals. Between the posts is a rough stone trough that is filled automatically with water by a rickety mechanical wind mill, whirling lazily in the breeze.

Water loving trees hug the river's course through the low lying valley. Giant beech and huge alders vie for the valuable sodden shoreline and shade the understory bushes and ferns from direct sunlight. The result is a lushly green, verdant forest that obscures the river from the view on the road, though the hiss of rushing water reveals it's course.

Running parallel to the road is a smooth rock lined trench that channels the road's run-off during rainstorms. This flat part of the road that follows the valley floor would be prone to turn into a muddy bog and therefore a hazard to most caravans and their pack animals. Anticipating this event, the road's engineers built drains into the lower side of the road that carry the runoff into the culvert, which carries it harmlessly down to the low end of the valley.

White barked birch trees populate the moist valleys that drain into the river to the southeast as the merchant road passes nearby.

The roadway takes advantage of a cut in the hill to negotiate a tumbled cliff face. At the top of the hill is a high, flat, steppe grassland, and at the bottom is the edge of the open range. At one point, the road narrows to cross a small stream. Very little mud gathers in the shallows of the stream and the pebbles and rocks glitter like gold as the wagon wheels churn the gravel.

Each striation varies in texture, composition and color. They are an open book for those with the specific knowledge to read it.

The merchant road threads through bottom of the small, narrow valley. Sheer granite walls block the view from the well traveled road to either side and above, only a narrow ray of sky testifies to the time of day. The engineers set a route as far as possible from the broken stones in the center of the valley and, by luck or design, this foresight has saved the road-bed from constant reconstruction. Small cracks run parallel to the road, but none have broken through the thick layers of sand and stone.

Tumbled boulders and landslides fan down from the crumbling walls of the valley. In the more narrow spots, the alluvial fans of debris clog the roadway and the practical merchants and their caravans have had to devise small detours around the bigger obstacles.

One layer of rock in the steep walls has eroded faster then the harder granite or bedrock above and below it. Soft sandstone has been stripped away to form an arch in the valley wall ... a concave indention that goes for hundreds of feet in both directions.  Within the hardened sediment left ages ago upon the land are treasures beyond value: fossilized shells by the thousands, in all sizes, shapes and colors.

The momentous forces that have wrought this valley still press upon the land and have done so for eons.  The walls of the valley are sheer and steep, and untouched by the raging waters of river or stream.  As if in testimony to the power of the forces that move the land, a huge dark boulder sits off to the side of the road. It is hewn in half like a sliced melon.  One part sits 20 feet north along the break in the rocks from the other part.

The rocky valley walls widen to the accommodate the splitting of the Tarath fault line. The Great Divide towers to the north beyond the fractured, broken badlands. Sheer, monolithic cliffs dropping for thousands of feet front the western edge of the mountains; their sharp, snow-capped peaks vaulting nearly vertically from the floor of the fault line valley. The merchant road bed is cracked and broken as it negotiates the larger twists and turns.

A short tremor suddenly rocks the cracked merchant road! A dusty pall sifts into the air from cracks in the ground and the shifting of gravel around the valley.  The tremor rolls through the canyon walls like a ripple, as if it were a linen sheet that was lifted and settled again. Pack animals and travelers alike stop momentarily and then hasten their pace as if to leave the quake behind them.

As the merchant road approaches the western end of the valley, the valley wall abruptly falls away to a sheer drop. Crumbling rock and dirt spill constantly into the deep abyss. Sections of the mountain have slid away into the valley and the merchant road has been rebuilt higher along the steeper sides of the mountain. The fault line of broken rocks continues its path of destruction to the west, skirted by the land-slide prone softer dirt.   A freshly uncovered crevice is here.

A treacherous dusty trail leads west along the shaky fault line from a fork in the main road. The original roadbed has fallen into the chasm years ago, leaving the merchants to their own wiles to ply the slippery slopes past the fault zone. Many attempts have failed at conquering the shifting dirt and rocks. Currently a bumpy trail skirts the bigger rocks and loose gravel.   A wide eyed merchant's corpse is here.

The old merchant road lies in pieces at the bottom of a deep gorge far below. An artificial pathway has been constructed in the wake of the recent collapse, allowing continued passage through the mountains. This new merchant road has been constructed in great haste and is still quite unstable. Gravel that has been spread on the road to make it safer, is actually making it far more precarious. Pebbles roll continuously off of the roads surface and down into the chasm below.

The road ascends upward at a rather severe angle towards the northwest combined with the shifting road surface, it makes this particular passage very difficult for any merchants traveling with a large quantity of goods. A swiftly flowing river is visible several hundred feet below, and it can only be assumed that it was the cause of the collapse of old merchant road. The audible roar of the river is evident, even this far above.

A lone carrion bird seems to stare from the branches of a gnarled old tree. The road surface alternates between the usual hard-packed dirt covered in gravel, and solid rock. The terrain creates even more difficult travel for those heading north or south. A large pile of broken wagons, barrels, and boxes lie quite some distance below. Many skeletons of pack animals, picked clean by carrion birds, are also discernible. It is highly likely some of the bones are Humanoid as well.

The road reaches the top of the cliff up the gentle slope to the east.  Some greying oak planks are here.

There is an extremely large crevasse in the roadway that would normally prevent any further travel along this road. Astoundingly, someone has constructed a very sturdy looking bridge using two perfectly chiseled granite blocks. The blocks make up the support for the bridge structure, which is also constructed of chiseled granite slabs. There is seemingly no explanation for the excellent condition of this stretch of the road.  A sturdy granite bridge is here.

The cliff face to the north is wet, but there is no apparent source of the moisture. A slight overhang also creates a near permanent shadow in the area, providing a perfect atmosphere for the dense lichen that covers the rocks. Sporadic tufts of grass futilely attempt to assert themselves against the multi-colored lichen, but the spongy fungus prevails. Strange looking spiders scurry about amongst the lichen-covered rocks, before disappearing over the top of the cliff.

A dangerously high cliff is visible to the south, while to the east a flat plateau leads the roadway between two large mountains. The green hue of a forest is just visible between them.

The road is almost non-existent. The many large granite boulders that cover the path evidence the instability of the mountains to the north and south. The merchants who travel this road have erected a series of shoddy road signs to direct travelers safely around the boulders. Several of these signs point away from a shadowy area just off the side of the road. The rocks of the area seem to hang over the road slightly, blocking out the light. Light colored stringy material is barely visible along the side of the path.  A flimsy wooden sign, a flimsy wooden sign, a craggy overhang, and a slightly bloated merchant's corpse are here.

The merchant road ascends slightly to the east as it travels between two mountain peaks. Up the slopes to the north and south is a dense forest with massive red barked trees. Closer to the path, the forest begins to thin out and only a few trees have established themselves close to the road. The merchants who made this road did not bother to go around one of the largest, which is situated directly in the middle of the path.  An ancient towering rosewood tree is here.

The tranquil terrain has been torn asunder to the northwest. One of the forces of nature has caused a great fissure to open in the earth. Although the fissure slopes downward at a severe angle, the terrain is surprisingly smooth and could be navigated even by a goods-loaded wagon. To the east a great deal of grass is growing on the road itself. It almost seems as if no one has used that road in a while.

It would seem this area is prone to landslides. A new road has been cut into the terrain to the southwest, heading in the direction of a smaller mountain peak. The old mountain trail is visible as it climbs up the barren mountainside to the north.

The path rises steeply to both the northeast and the west, traveling up the base of two opposing mountain peaks. The smaller peak to the west is far less pronounced than the peak to the northeast. This narrow valley is enclosed on all sides by mountains. Just to the south of the path is a small lake full of what is surely ice cold water. Various small streamlets are visible running down a few of the surrounding snow-capped peaks, ensuring that the icy lake will remain filled.

The road bends to the southwest around a large boulder as it slopes up the side of this mountain. From this vantage point, large imposing jagged peaks of the mountains above Rathan are visible. Each peak is heavily laden with snow, with only small sections of rock visible. A trail, presumably this one, is also visible traveling northward toward the peaks in the distance.

Small rocks and pebbles tumble over the edge of a sharp drop off to the south. In the distance over the edge of the cliff, through two rather large hills, a city with octagonal walls surrounding it is just visible. The road here is rather narrow, pushing as far against the cliff face as possible. The pathway continues to ascend to the west, making its way up the mountainside.

The air is filled with small flecks of falling snow, but none of it looks to be hitting the ground. Small leafless shrubs dominate the landscape, leaving no explanation as to why they all appear to be dead. The main road leads down the mountainside to the east, and up over a crest to the northwest. This spot is approximately halfway up the slope of this cold mountain peak. The merchant road is visible to the east, making its way slowly out of the Tarath Bends.

Piles of rubble flank the road on both sides. Some new and some old, this rubble is a mixture of two guard towers and this side of the mountain.

Old trees lay side by side with the massive boulders of the mountain, intermingling in a terrible landslide. The mountain top has broken off and slid across the eastern road stopping all forms of transportation. It would take years for mortal hands to remove the tons of stone from the original roadway to make it passable once again. Thankfully, nature has changed the landscape for the better, and has opened a gap through the mountain to the north.

The sturdy wooden walls and support beams surrounding you serve as an extension of the dark stone cavern that descends gradually into the depths of the earth. The smell of dried blood drifts in on a cool breeze from the cavern, only to be replaced by the over powering scent of burning sulfur. The walls of the cavern house several mounted display cases, each one stocked fully with potions featuring a range of effects from restoring life to taking the last breath of an unsuspecting victim. An intricately carved ash bookshelf stretches up toward the ceiling above, housing a large collection of books on anything from Arachnian alchemy techniques to Taathian torture rituals. The contents of each tome likely played a role in the development of the shop's inventory.   An intricately carved ash bookshelf, an open dark cavern, a closed rune-etched ebony door, and a closed display case are here.

A few giant sugar maples line the road, their silvery leaves glistening in the light. A soft breeze curls along the road, tugging at the leaves and flinging dust into the air.  A closed dragon carved pine door is here.

It is rather peaceful on this street. The eastern side of the street boasts the burned-out shell of an old wood and stone warehouse.

A multitude of silvery roofed buildings, surrounded by tall evergreen trees, rise along the Silver Mountain's southern slope. Far to the north, the snowcapped peak of the Silver Mountain rises above the glimmering crystal dome of the Rathene Royal Palace. City guards, merchants, and townsfolk continuously pass through the gate set in the outer wall to the south.

Beyond the gate lies the great city of Rathan, whose silver rooftops rise beyond the wall and  continue upward along the Silver Mountain's southern slope.

The sturdy wooden walls and support beams surrounding you serve as an extension of the dark stone cavern that descends gradually into the depths of the earth. The smell of dried blood drifts in on a cool breeze from the cavern, only to be replaced by the over powering scent of burning sulfur. The walls of the cavern house several mounted display cases, each one stocked fully with potions featuring a range of effects from restoring life to taking the last breath of an unsuspecting victim. An intricately carved ash bookshelf stretches up toward the ceiling above, housing a large collection of books on anything from Arachnian alchemy techniques to Taathian torture rituals. The contents of each tome likely played a role in the development of the shop's inventory.   An intricately carved ash bookshelf, an open dark cavern, a closed rune-etched ebony door, and a closed display case are here.

Small leafless shrubs dominate the landscape, leaving no explanation as to why they all appear to be dead. The main road leads down the mountainside to the east, and up over a crest to the northwest. This spot is approximately halfway up the slope of this cold mountain peak. The merchant road is visible to the east, making its way slowly out of the Tarath Bends.

The path rises steeply to both the northeast and the west, traveling up the base of two opposing mountain peaks. The smaller peak to the west is far less pronounced than the peak to the northeast. This narrow valley is enclosed on all sides by mountains. Just to the south of the path is a small lake full of what is surely ice cold water. Various small streamlets are visible running down a few of the surrounding snow-capped peaks, ensuring that the icy lake will remain filled.

This section of the road is all that remains of the former mountain trail. The old pathway is visible to the north, however a large pile of moist earth, dull grey rock, and broken tree trunks has buried it several feet high making further passage impossible. It would seem this area is prone to landslides. A new road has been cut into the terrain to the southwest, heading in the direction of a smaller mountain peak. The old mountain trail is visible as it climbs up the barren mountainside to the north.

One of the walls in this gully has collapsed inward, covering the road surface. The landslide is surely recent, as it is not yet packed down and is still rolling fresh dirt from above. It should be fairly easy to bypass this section of the road by climbing over the shifting dirt. Although surely dangerous, it might be possible to climb up the slide itself.  A landslide is here.

A slight wind blows through the area, picking up speed as it continues southeast between two hills. The road drops down to the west through a deep gully before turning out of sight. There is quite a bit of debris on the road in that direction. A family of prairie dogs has dug a series of holes a few meters from the road. One is constantly on watch, attempting to keep the family safe from harm. At the slightest noise, it scurries back into its hole and out of sight.  An animal made hole is here.

The ground is so dry that most of the topsoil is easily pulled off by the strong winds. Large angry clouds of dust move back and forth throughout the area, wreaking havoc on the eyes and lungs of any that dare to pass through them.  A large thick cloud of dust is here.

The road slopes down slightly to the east, gently following a valley between two large hills. Ground dwelling rodents move about on the arid hill to the north gathering food. Large conifers, capable of withstanding the dry climate, sparsely populate the hill to the south. Visible among the tops of the trees are several majestic red-tailed Rathanian hawks. The screech of the hawks fills the air, as they hunt their small furry prey from above.

The tranquil terrain has been torn asunder to the northwest. One of the forces of nature has caused a great fissure to open in the earth. Although the fissure slopes downward at a severe angle, the terrain is surprisingly smooth and could be navigated even by a goods-loaded wagon. To the east a great deal of grass is growing on the road itself. It almost seems as if no one has used that road in a while.

The merchants who made this road did not bother to go around one of the largest, which is situated directly in the middle of the path.  An ancient towering rosewood tree is here.

The road is almost non-existent. The many large granite boulders that cover the path evidence the instability of the mountains to the north and south. The merchants who travel this road have erected a series of shoddy road signs to direct travelers safely around the boulders. Several of these signs point away from a shadowy area just off the side of the road. The rocks of the area seem to hang over the road slightly, blocking out the light. Light colored stringy material is barely visible along the side of the path.  A flimsy wooden sign, a flimsy wooden sign, a craggy overhang, and a slightly bloated merchant's corpse are here.

The cliff face to the north is wet, but there is no apparent source of the moisture. A slight overhang also creates a near permanent shadow in the area, providing a perfect atmosphere for the dense lichen that covers the rocks. Sporadic tufts of grass futilely attempt to assert themselves against the multi-colored lichen, but the spongy fungus prevails. Strange looking spiders scurry about amongst the lichen-covered rocks, before disappearing over the top of the cliff.

As the merchant road approaches the western end of the valley, the valley wall abruptly falls away to a sheer drop. Crumbling rock and dirt spill constantly into the deep abyss. Sections of the mountain have slid away into the valley and the merchant road has been rebuilt higher along the steeper sides of the mountain. The fault line of broken rocks continues its path of destruction to the west, skirted by the land-slide prone softer dirt.   A freshly uncovered crevice is here.

The momentous forces that have wrought this valley still press upon the land and have done so for eons.  The walls of the valley are sheer and steep, and untouched by the raging waters of river or stream.  As if in testimony to the power of the forces that move the land, a huge dark boulder sits off to the side of the road. It is hewn in half like a sliced melon.  One part sits 20 feet north along the break in the rocks from the other part.

One layer of rock in the steep walls has eroded faster then the harder granite or bedrock above and below it. Soft sandstone has been stripped away to form an arch in the valley wall ... a concave indention that goes for hundreds of feet in both directions.  Within the hardened sediment left ages ago upon the land are treasures beyond value: fossilized shells by the thousands, in all sizes, shapes and colors.

The merchant road threads through bottom of the small, narrow valley. Sheer granite walls block the view from the well traveled road to either side and above, only a narrow ray of sky testifies to the time of day. The engineers set a route as far as possible from the broken stones in the center of the valley and, by luck or design, this foresight has saved the road-bed from constant reconstruction. Small cracks run parallel to the road, but none have broken through the thick layers of sand and stone.

Each striation varies in texture, composition and color. They are an open book for those with the specific knowledge to read it.

The grassland plateau is embraced by a stand of dark green oak trees so thick that little light passes through the profusion of their many lobed leaves. The forest is ancient and the trunks of the trees bare witness to fires, lightning strikes and the attacks of insects. Large gout-like burls disfigure some of the wide, grey trunks which have grown quietly next to the road for hundreds of years.

The merchant roads widens as it travels another grass swept plateau. The mountain range fills the northern skyline in stark detail. Huge snow capped peaks and rough faced cliffs are close enough to see the individual boulders, waterfalls, and haphazard game trails. Much higher up the great mountainsides a line where trees stop growing gives testament to the altitude. The air is cool.

The roadway takes advantage of a cut in the hill to negotiate a tumbled cliff face. At the top of the hill is a high, flat, steppe grassland, and at the bottom is the edge of the open range. At one point, the road narrows to cross a small stream. Very little mud gathers in the shallows of the stream and the pebbles and rocks glitter like gold as the wagon wheels churn the gravel.

White barked birch trees populate the moist valleys that drain into the river to the southeast as the merchant road passes nearby. The tall vertical trees reach to the sky in a beautiful dance reminiscent of dancers waving their arms gracefully to some unheard rhythm. The grain-laden grasses sway in accompaniment, and the tinkling waterfalls and babbling creeks beat like odd syncopated patterns onto the rocks.

Running parallel to the road is a smooth rock lined trench that channels the road's run-off during rainstorms. This flat part of the road that follows the valley floor would be prone to turn into a muddy bog and therefore a hazard to most caravans and their pack animals. Anticipating this event, the road's engineers built drains into the lower side of the road that carry the runoff into the culvert, which carries it harmlessly down to the low end of the valley.

Water loving trees hug the river's course through the low lying valley. Giant beech and huge alders vie for the valuable sodden shoreline and shade the understory bushes and ferns from direct sunlight. The result is a lushly green, verdant forest that obscures the river from the view on the road, though the hiss of rushing water reveals it's course.

The decaying remains of the bridge workers camp sprawls across this flat valley. To house their draft beasts, the workers constructed small stalls and shelters from rickety boards nailed quixotically to the standing trees. Three brass ring topped posts lie sunk into the grasslands turf, to the south, which was most likely used for tethering grazing animals. Between the posts is a rough stone trough that is filled automatically with water by a rickety mechanical wind mill, whirling lazily in the breeze.

Boulders stacked in pyramids contained by large timbers stand mutely to the side of the roadway next to an impromptu dump of broken tools, wooden stakes and empty buckets lined with mortar. Deeply grooved sled tracks lead to the east towards the bridge from this part of the road where the flatness of the valley was best suited for the staging area during the bridge's reconstruction. Smooth rectangles of tent foundations still mark their location in a semi circle around a blackened fire ring where the workers and their supervisors lived during it's rebuilding.

On the northern edge of the road stands a tall, flat rock. Chipped into the shape of a pillar and abraded to smoothness, it bears the stamped surveyor's mark of the road's builder. The mark's grooved letters are filled with sand and dust and obscured from age, but the arrows delineating north, south, east and west are clear and easy to read. The rest of the stamp is undecipherable and lends mystery to the road's origin.

A brown and white osprey soars above the raging river, scanning the water for a meal. Suddenly, it dives down to the surface and snatches a rather large trout from the water. The trout wriggles helplessly in the large birds grip as it is carried off to a nest of sticks and twigs high in the distant treetops.

Withstanding seasonal floods and constant traffic, the durable road shows how affective good design and competent construction can be. It travels a hand paved berm straight to an imposing grey stone bridge to the southeast. The pilons of the bridge are cloaked in river mist as the raging river sweeps by. Only the brightness of the fluttering flags that top the spans stand out sharply.

A massive stone bridge spans a raging grey tinted river as it runs it's course towards the southeast. The mud around the bridge footings has been churned by wheels of quarry wagons, tracks of sleds bearing block and tackle, shod hooves of draft beasts and booted feet of masons and bridge workers. The newer parts of the huge bridge are obvious due to the contrast in colors of mortar and rock. Bright banners snap briskly in the wind from both ends of the bridge.  A broken wooden wagon is here.

Mismatched mortar colors and varying types and cuts of the stone show the extent of the reconstruction made by quick working masons. A few proud workers chiseled their initials and the date into their handiwork, most reading the date of Rinannimas, 6th month, 61st day, year 313. Bright banners flutter in the breeze on both sides of the bridge as if in celebration of its victory over both the river's truculence and sabotage.

Just to the north, the roadway curves gently around a bend in a large river that flows towards the southeast. An enormous smooth round rock splits off a small eddy from the main current resulting a deep, clear pool by the eastern side of the road. The cool calm water catches the reflection of the white snowcapped mountain range further up the valley while the river rushes past towards Spur. Five fishermen recline on folding chairs or against rocks, tethered by the silvery lines of their poles to the fishing hole. Each fisherman is spread evenly around the pool as if held apart by some invisible barrier as they eye the large shadowy fish shapes finning effortlessly against the mild current in the eddy.

The pool is damned by a small hillock which allows no drainage so the pool remains stagnant. The mountains to the north reflect in perfectly upside-down symmetry on the still pond's surface, only wavering slightly in concentric circles to the deft touch of small insects.

Travelers from Rathan to the northwest, and the Trade Route to the south, converge at Spur's west gate. Guards posted on the ground give those seeking to enter the city a cursory once-over. Their lack of interest shows that anyone approaching has already been observed from above for some time. A grate in the ground loosens mud from wagon wheels and hooves before they pass through the gate, helping to keep the streets of Spur fairly clean.  An open giant patched steelwood gate, a giant green oak tree, a small blue pool, a thick oak grate over the pool, a polished stone marker, and a fluffy white layer of snow are here.

Those in need of goods or supplies head west towards the market, those looking for the news of the day head east towards Town Square.  A street lantern is here.

[Trade Way.]

A large gate separates the Merchant District and Town Square-the hub of Spur's activity. The partially opened gate is currently able to accommodate the simultaneous passage of several locals and visitors, but can be expanded to accept carriages, or sealed to ward against invasion.  Guards stand sentry from atop the wall as well as the ground.  A street lantern is here.

[Merchant Walk.]

Merchant Walk comes to an abrupt end at a massive moonsilver gate. The towering walls of Spur on either side of the gates force all to pass by the guards who are constantly on the watch for thieves and bandits. Just beyond the gates one can glimpse the bustling Merchant District of Spur.  A freshly painted oak sign and a street lantern are here.

Several city guardsmen have just finished wrestling to the ground some young tough thieves, who thought to rob one of the returning merchants. To one side a relieved-looking Fir Elf gentleman holds on tightly to his gold-tipped walking stick, as the human boy yells his innocence to any who might listen. His pleas fall on deaf ears as the guards drag him away.  A street lantern is here.

Merchants, some in frilly finery, others dressed in homespun wools, travel back and forth along this street on their way to and from work. They seem to blend together here, if only briefly. Several of the more haughty looking merchants are trailed by overloaded carts pushed along by haggard young apprentices.   A street lantern is here.

A neatly kept park fronts this portion of Merchant Walk. Topiary and low shrubberies partition off small sections of the park. Young lovers sit on benches almost hidden from view, gazing at each other with looks of love, oblivious to the continual bustle of passing customers and merchants on their way to do business.  A street lantern is here.

Neatly trimmed shrubbery line well-maintained cobblestones along Merchant Walk. Apprentices rush by carrying supplies and orders, carrying out their masters' business.

[Town Square West.]

People carrying bundles stream in from the west and rapidly lose themselves in the large crowds moving about in the vast town square. Several citizens head west with bulging coinpurses babbling excitedly about what they're going to purchase. Giggling children dart around the slower moving folks rushing on their way to spend the silvers in their pockets.  A street lantern is here.

Two elegant buildings, one to the north and one to the west, stand on either side of a quickly degrading road. Nattily dressed patrons of the two establishments hurry to their destination, not pausing for fear of being robbed, or worse. To the northwest the houses steadily become more decrepit. A dark pallor of smoky air hangs heavily over the area.  A street lantern is here.

[Low Street.]

A darkly clad hoodlum leans against a worn street sign. He eyes those who pass by very carefully and then makes a few gestures into the shadows. All who are forced to travel upon this road have learned to keep one hand on their coin purse, the other on their weapon, and their wits about them.  A faded wooden sign and a glowing street lantern are here.

[Low Street.]

Low Street is the thoroughfare that carries people to the northwestern portion of Spur. The traffic along this road leans towards those without any viable economic means. Women who look older then their years, crippled old men and darkly clad shadowy figures all move stoically towards their destination. Only the plodding of worn shoes breaks the dismal silence.  A street lantern is here.

A beggar lies in a large pile of trash snoring deeply. His clothing is torn, filthy dirty, and a strong smell of alcohol wafts off of him. Sniffing around in the garbage, a hound looks for any scrap that can be eaten. The pup nudges the beggar and begins to rummage through the trash that he is using for bedding.  A street lantern is here.

Potholes and cracks in the road impede travel on this portion of Low Street. Maintenance is not considered a priority, due to the roads distance from the center of the city. Unimpeded by the poor condition of the street, several people gather around a nearby newsstand, reading the latest issue of the Spurian Free Press and discussing politics. Across the street from the newsstand a sign next to a weathered brown wooden door reads, "Spurian Free Press" in large, bold letters.   A street lantern, an open weathered brown wooden door, and a wooden newsstand are here.

[Low Street.]

Low Street ends at a gate that stands permanently ajar, its mechanism jammed and broken. Set in the massive city walls between Town Square and Spur's Poor Quarter, the gates rickety appearance befits that which lies behind it. Loud and colorful words, mixing with the sound of playing children can be heard from within.  An open iron gate and a street lantern are here.

A large section of buildings on the west side of the street is now gone. The constant noises of construction and demolition pound away at all hours. The street is immaculately clean save the tons of stones piled along the poor quarter wall. The street stones extend westward, paving the beginnings of a large square shaped area. A tall stone building, painted a deep sable, rises against the poor quarter wall. Shabbily dressed people enter and exit the building rapidly. Many exit carrying bundles of papers. A faint haze of smoke drifts from the buildings doorway.  A pile of stones and an open wide smoke filled doorway are here.

The broken and shattered remains of the Temple of Set litter the road and the spot where the temple once stood. Beggars and poor folk stand staring forlornly at the remains. A few make their way through the broken gate, some crying and some showing no emotion at all. Offerings to Set have been placed all around and litter the area.  An open large wooden gate and some stairs are here.

Gifts and offerings to Set have been carefully placed around the pile of rubble that used to be the temple. Elderly Clerics stand at the ready to comfort the many poor and faithful who have come to gather at this place. A makeshift shrine had been dedicated to Set and is carefully guarded by shady looking Sanene in dark cloaks.  An open large wooden gate, a small shrine, and some crumbling opalescent stairs going down are here.

[Sewers.]

This is a spot of relative clean and calm in the sewers. Although the putrid scent of sewage and rot lingers here, it is not as cloying and overwhelming as before. The walls here are barely coated in scum and the floor of the tunnel is less thick with sedimented sewage than in other parts of the sewers. Water, with much fewer solids floating in it, flows southward slowly, almost lazily. A distant sound of rushing volumes of water can be heard.  What appear to be the rungs of a ladder are set into the wall on one side, leading up to a rusting grate. The northern wall seems to have collapsed at some point.  A glowing slimy wrought iron sconce is here.

A cool draft of air rises from a small sewer grate in the floor. Dark shadows flow in and out through the grate, some coming and some going. A small opening near the base appears large enough to allow a person through. The light in this part of the temple is somewhat darker than the rest. There are scuff marks on the floor from the boots of many people.  An opal-eyed flaming onyx serpent is here.

Torn maps and shattered prayer beads decorate the floor. The remains of a store can be scene but of the owner there is no trace.  Damaged statues of serpents and jackals line each wall, and shimmer with a soft glow. The many shadows that can be found in the temple pass by now and then, their presence lending a mystical feel to the area.  An opal-eyed flaming onyx serpent, some broken opalescent carved serpent statues, and some broken opalescent carved jackal statues are here.

[Set Temple, Altar Room]

A massive tile mosaic covers the whole floor in this area. The image of the mosaic depicts a scene of a young man and woman in holy garments. Serpents and Jackals surround the edges of the mosaic, seemingly dancing around the clerics. Set's holy symbol appears in every free space and shimmers with a brilliant light. The richness and detail in the image are breathtaking and beyond mortal craftsmanship. A large altar stands directly in the middle of the image and radiates with a soft glow.   A large serpent-headed opal altar, an opal-eyed flaming onyx serpent, and an open serpent carved opal chest are here.

The whole eastern wall is one big gray shadow. The city of Spur shimmers and wavers from blurry to clear detail. Shadows can be seen coming and going through the gray image. From what you can make out of the city, it seems entirely out of place. There is no known reason how you could have come to this part of the city. Confusion is common, but it seems quite obvious this is something divinely created.  An opal-eyed flaming onyx serpent and some blurry grey city shadows are here.

A Usil driver yells at his two Oog-ra helpers, explaining to them that the armoire should be sitting upright and not on its side. They scratch themselves in confusion, and you can hear them muttering something about leaving it on its side, so it does not fall again.

Its location close to the Royale is not a coincidence. A gold-trimmed door is proof of the success of this branch of the Spurian bank and those who run it.  An elegant gold-trimmed walnut door, an open emerald steel door, a street lantern, and a new rosewood sign pointing southeast are here.

The outward appearance of the people here seems a bit classier. Rich clothing and large coin purses are prevalent amongst the travelers.

The well maintained road is lined with small brass lanterns, each swinging off an individual pole.  A street lantern is here.

People carrying bundles stream in from the west and rapidly lose themselves in the large crowds moving about in the vast town square.

Giggling children dart around the slower moving folks rushing on their way to spend the silvers in their pockets.  A street lantern is here.

Two elegant buildings, one to the north and one to the west, stand on either side of a quickly degrading road.

A darkly clad hoodlum leans against a worn street sign. He eyes those who pass by very carefully and then makes a few gestures into the shadows. All who are forced to travel upon this road have learned to keep one hand on their coin purse, the other on their weapon, and their wits about them.

Low Street is the thoroughfare that carries people to the northwestern portion of Spur. The traffic along this road leans towards those without any viable economic means. Women who look older then their years, crippled old men and darkly clad shadowy figures all move stoically towards their destination. Only the plodding of worn shoes breaks the dismal silence.

Potholes and cracks in the road impede travel on this portion of Low Street. Maintenance is not considered a priority, due to the roads distance from the center of the city. Unimpeded by the poor condition of the street, several people gather around a nearby newsstand, reading the latest issue of the Spurian Free Press and discussing politics. Across the street from the newsstand a sign next to a weathered brown wooden door reads, "Spurian Free Press" in large, bold letters.   A street lantern, an open weathered brown wooden door, and a wooden newsstand are here.

Nattily dressed patrons of the two establishments hurry to their destination, not pausing for fear of being robbed, or worse. To the northwest the houses steadily become more decrepit. A dark pallor of smoky air hangs heavily over the area.  A street lantern is here.

This area is illuminated.
You see the 1st old busybody.
In the area are Almanetta the San Elf and Clemento the Human.
Obvious paths: east* southeast* south* west* northwest*.

A darkly clad hoodlum leans against a worn street sign. He eyes those who pass by very carefully and then makes a few gestures into the shadows. All who are forced to travel upon this road have learned to keep one hand on their coin purse, the other on their weapon, and their wits about them.  A faded wooden sign and a glowing street lantern are here.

[Low Street.]

Low Street is the thoroughfare that carries people to the northwestern portion of Spur. The traffic along this road leans towards those without any viable economic means. Women who look older then their years, crippled old men and darkly clad shadowy figures all move stoically towards their destination. Only the plodding of worn shoes breaks the dismal silence.  A street lantern is here.

[Low Street.]

A beggar lies in a large pile of trash snoring deeply. His clothing is torn, filthy dirty, and a strong smell of alcohol wafts off of him. Sniffing around in the garbage, a hound looks for any scrap that can be eaten. The pup nudges the beggar and begins to rummage through the trash that he is using for bedding.  A street lantern is here.

[Low Street.]

Potholes and cracks in the road impede travel on this portion of Low Street. Maintenance is not considered a priority, due to the roads distance from the center of the city. Unimpeded by the poor condition of the street, several people gather around a nearby newsstand, reading the latest issue of the Spurian Free Press and discussing politics. Across the street from the newsstand a sign next to a weathered brown wooden door reads, "Spurian Free Press" in large, bold letters.   A street lantern, an open weathered brown wooden door, and a wooden newsstand are here.

A rusty printing press, held together mostly by chicken wire and a prayer, dominates the center of the room. To one side, an elegant stained glass light fixture hangs over a long table that serves as a shared workspace for many of the staff. A frazzled looking Usil elf huddles at one end of the table, peering through thick glasses at a piece of parchment. Scattered at his feet are several heavily marked and crumpled papers.   A rusty printing press, a long table, a glowing elegant stained glass light fixture, and an open weathered brown wooden door are here.

A rusty printing press, held together mostly by chicken wire and a prayer, dominates the center of the room.

A frazzled looking Usil elf huddles at one end of the table, peering through thick glasses at a piece of parchment. Scattered at his feet are several heavily marked and crumpled papers.   A rusty printing press, a long table, a glowing elegant stained glass light fixture, and a closed weathered brown wooden door are here.

This room is illuminated.
In the room are Quint the San Elf, Almanetta the San Elf (seated), and Clemento the Human.
Obvious exits: None.

A rusty printing press, held together mostly by chicken wire and a prayer, dominates the center of the room. To one side, an elegant stained glass light fixture hangs over a long table that serves as a shared workspace for many of the staff. A frazzled looking Usil elf huddles at one end of the table, peering through thick glasses at a piece of parchment. Scattered at his feet are several heavily marked and crumpled papers.   A rusty printing press, a long table, a glowing elegant stained glass light fixture, and a closed weathered brown wooden door are here.

Potholes and cracks in the road impede travel on this portion of Low Street. Maintenance is not considered a priority, due to the roads distance from the center of the city. Unimpeded by the poor condition of the street, several people gather around a nearby newsstand, reading the latest issue of the Spurian Free Press and discussing politics. Across the street from the newsstand a sign next to a weathered brown wooden door reads, "Spurian Free Press" in large, bold letters.

Low Street ends at a gate that stands permanently ajar, its mechanism jammed and broken.

A frazzled looking Usil elf huddles at one end of the table, peering through thick glasses at a piece of parchment. Scattered at his feet are several heavily marked and crumpled papers.   A rusty printing press, a long table, a glowing elegant stained glass light fixture, and a closed weathered brown wooden door are here.

This room is illuminated.
In the room is Almanetta the San Elf (seated).

A rusty printing press, held together mostly by chicken wire and a prayer, dominates the center of the room. To one side, an elegant stained glass light fixture hangs over a long table that serves as a shared workspace for many of the staff. A frazzled looking Usil elf huddles at one end of the table, peering through thick glasses at a piece of parchment. Scattered at his feet are several heavily marked and crumpled papers.   A rusty printing press, a long table, a glowing elegant stained glass light fixture, and a closed weathered brown wooden door are here.
