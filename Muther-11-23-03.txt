The hum of busy bees and hummingbirds add a tone of unity to the soft chants of the priests and murmurings of those here to offer up the sacrifices and tithes to the great Goddess, Elindale. Several monks wearing floor length robes sit in silence, with the occasional clasped hands rising up in a particularly vibrant part of prayer. The altar itself is composed of growing flowers, the tiny buds enclosing gems and gold alike. Around the base of the altar grows a ring of mushrooms, vibrantly cloaked in red with white spots dotting the umbrellas.

[Elindale's Temple.]

A large tapestry lines the outside wall of the passageway, most impressive in that it is not made of fabric, but of vines as tiny as thick hairs, growing in a weave. The delicate shadings of the plants is perfectly natural, and as the eye becomes unfocused, a picture of a diminutive, beautiful maiden sits amongst a foresty background. The wall opposite of this magnificent tapestry is lined with portraits of prominent temple leaders, the colors vibrant, bringing a life-like sense to the frames. The eyes of the maiden in the tapestry seem to follow you, staring directly as you pass, boring into your soul.  A vellum portrait, a canvas portrait, a suede portrait, some unfinished portraits, and a carefully painted silk screen are here.

[Treehaven, Main Platform]

New wooden planks fit side by side creating the walkway that extends proudly upon the reconstructed supports. The view of the forest to the northwest is quite panoramic, despite the burnt spikes of trees in the midst. A staircase here seems to have some enchantment, judging by the strange appearance of unicorns, bears and owls on the lower steps. Strange, due to the fact that they don't appear carved, painted, or put there by any hand-made means. It is as if the glyphs grew into the wood itself. Mysterious symbols are scattered throughout the portraits, which shimmer with a golden whisper as they are approached.

The platform has been swept recently, revealing the new boards that have replaced some of the burned ones.  The remains of the old bank to the south have been completely cleared away, leaving just the shell of the old building there.  Intricately crafted stairs lead from the platform to the new building that resides in the upper branches.  An open door and a freshly painted wooden sign are here.

[Gaspar's Grog and Grub.]

Four sturdy walls and a roof of woven branches enclose this small tavern. From the forest floor, winding their way around the trunk of the Mother Tree, a set of intricately railed steps serve as the entrance and exit of the town of Treehaven. Strangers arriving at the top of the steps find themselves under the watchful eye of patrons seated at tables positioned about the light, airy room. A set of oak steps lead up to the new Council chambers.  An ivory inlaid pine bar, a wooden stool, a long weathered wooden bench, a long musty wooden table, some steps circling the tree, some freshly crafted oak steps, an open door, a paper covered posting board, and a gilt framed painting on the wall are here.

[Steps.]

A great deal of the forest is visible between the ornately crafted columns of the spiraling staircase. Directly below, the damage from the recent fire is very evident.  Further away, however, the lush forest spreads out and reminds one of the greatness of the Caersech.  Some steps circling the tree are here.

The latticework surrounding and covering the spiral staircase is finely crafted.  The intertwining beams seem to weave a delicate pattern above you, accenting the view of the forest floor. The view of burned trees and the scorched structure of the fallen inn spoils the otherwise wondrous scene.  Some steps circling the tree are here.

[Hope's Path.]

Contrasting starkly with the ashes of the forest and brush is a freshly constructed set of stairs that wraps itself about the large tree. The intricate woodwork that decorates the steps is of the finest quality, as if in parody to the blackened destruction of the hedges and brambles around the base of the trunk. Bright green leaves of clover have begun springing up through the ashy soil in conjunction with soft moss to lend a durable cushion to this well-traveled spot.  Some steps circling the tree, a freshly painted wooden sign, a healthy green patch of clover, a flowing marble fountain, and some clover shaped stones are here.

[Hope's Path.]

The path of four leaf clove shaped flagstones leads past a small clean shack and into a well formed tunnel through the thorn bushes to the east and the Caersech to the west. The small shack is set back from the road, its walls built of a whitewashed birch. A sturdy corral, filled with well-fed horses, stands to the left of the shack. A matched pair of dapple grays stand in front of the shack waiting to take their human baggage to their destination. To the left of the door, behind a small paned window, a beautiful Fir Elf female takes coin and in return, with a charming smile, directs those who have paid their fare into the waiting room.  A small shack, a freshly painted sign, a notice of non-refund, and a small winding stone pathway are here.

[Hope's Path.]

A fine haze of dust hovers over the remains of the Silver Owl Inn. Through the fallen timbers and memories of lives lost, one can see brilliant green sprouts reaching for sunlight. A tiny songbird perches on an old stick of furniture poking through the rubble, singing sweetly to herald new life and hope. A small winding path of stones placed in the shape of four leaf clovers winds itself through the forest.  A small winding stone pathway and a charred ancient steelwood tree are here.

A number of darkened and burnt trunks still stand around the path. A few patches of undergrowth have started to spot the earth about, trying to cover the desolation. Small four-leaf-clover shaped stones form a small path through the darkened trunks. The soft sound of running water echoes in from the west.  A small winding stone path is here.

[Hope's Path.]

A small stream runs noisily under the two bridges spanning the ravine. A number of the brunt oaks still stand about, memorials to the forest this once was. A number of small saplings dot the ground between the black trunks. Between the stream bank and oaks, a small path of four-leaf-clover shaped stones weave a windy path through the forest.  A stone bridge, a wooden bridge, a clump of wildgrass, and a small winding stone path are here.

The path bends to the northwest and northeast here, skirting the foot of the hill. The stream bubbles along seemingly unaffected by the loathsome presence of the hill.

Swollen beyond its banks, the once small creek is now a rushing overflowing river. What used to be the charred footbridge is now a safe haven for fish well down river, nothing left of its structure. Set well into the bank of the river is a long steel pole. Lashed to the pole is a heavy rope. The voice of the riverboat captain can be heard echoing across the water, taking command and moving his cargo.  A flowing river, a freshly painted sign, and some carved oak benches are here.

[Riverboat.]

Lined with wooden seats, this slim oak boat looks to be able to carry its passengers relatively quickly to their destination. A sturdy rope is threaded through a steel eyelet that rises about two feet above the bow of the boat. The captain's muscles strain with each heave-ho on the rope, as the boat cleaves through the deep waters of the river. A thick mist circles about the river and the boat as it very slowly is pulled across the river.  A wooden railing is here.

This area is illuminated.

[Riverside.]

The footbridge that once connected this path to its match on the other side of the overflowing rushing river is now nothing more then a few charred pilings. Tiny insects buzz around their remains, finding a comfortable new home. Lashed to the remains of one of the more sturdy pilings is a tall steel pole. Wrapped around the pole, and tied securely is a taut rope. Bobbing ever so lightly due to the strain of the riverboat, the rope holds tight.  A flowing river, a freshly painted sign, some carved oak benches, and a riverboat are here.

[Brambles.]

Struggling through the underbrush, you make your way down the small trail only to be brought up short by an impenetrable wall of brambles. Plump red berries hang from the small branches of the bushes, guarded by long, sharp thorns. On a low hanging branch overhead, a watchful owl stares at you with golden eyes.  A slightly hidden trail, an ethereal looking owl, and some fragrant red rose petals are here.

A small orb of light hovers in the center of the path before you, only to disappear as you near it, reappearing further away into the swamp. Stepping near the orb to investigate closer only causes it to again blink out of existence, forming once more, deeper into the mists.

Ravens dark as pitch spread their feathers to a wing-span of nearly four feet, so large they are, as they quarrel over an abandoned mule carcass on the roadside breaks out. How final death seems, so casually nature simply encompasses the bodies of the fallen, through carrion hunters or moldy decay. Yet through death there be life again, any number of these ravens being sustained through this death, so they may live. Perhaps only to become sustenance for one of the swamp creatures, who, in turn, spends its life continuing the cycle.

The dried trees encroach even up to the roadside, here, their limbs reaching down to the passage as if to snatch the unwary passer-by. A sudden shift in the wind brings forth the sullied aroma of death and decay from the swamp southern lands. Slurpish noises belie the path of some creature traveling through the muddy scape, their movements hidden behind the smoky mist that reduces visibility to a mere few feet past the swamp's edge.

The open plains are becoming scattered with scraggly trees, the wood of which proving inefficient to use for building as the elements of nature have grown the trunks so twisted and hard in order to withstand the onslaughts of time. Circling around the northern base of a small hill, there lies the lapping edge of the swamp to the south. Small slimy creatures lie on the smooth stones near the water, darting into it at the speed of light as you near them with tiny splashes and echoing wakes blending into the small, gentle waves coming into the shore. Swarms of mosquitoes move along the land in unison, lending them the appearance of large, unified bodies hovering around for the next feast.

A hedge of spiky brambles forms a natural division from the lands and the swampy terrain to the south. Tall, limbless trees dot the horizon there, their bases lost in the misty depths of the gases hovering over the waters. Now and then a strange, growling sound echos up to the north, or an odd, high-pitched call of some unseen crow, probably feasting on a fallen creature hidden in the mists. The path curves away from the sounds, as popular choice has preferred to travel around the edges, rather than through the marshy sludge.

[South gate.]

Through the gate lies the city of Spur, the major center of trade and civilization on the plains. The dusty road leading through the gates is well traveled, and walls of the city are in good repair. A small shack sits to the west of the road, during most times of the day a dusty coach can be seen waiting in front, its horses stomping with impatience to be gone. To the right of the door is a small window, its opening covered with metal bars. An old man, missing most of his teeth, waits patiently for the travelers to pay their fare, and then directs them into the waiting area. On the east side of the road a billowing multicolored tent has been erected, the hustle and bustle of merchants and customers can be seen coming and going at all times of the day.  A rainbow silk tent and an open iron gate are here.

Set within a wide tunnel leading through the hedge to the north is the Wilderness Gate. It separates the settled lands of Spur from the open plains to the south of the city. The plains stretch as far as the eyes can see, the horizon and the walls of the fort down the road the only blemishes of the grassy landscape in the distance. The stones of the road are smoothly set together, well built to withstand heavy travel. A broken wagon wheel, discarded some time ago, covers a spot of nearby grass, weeds trying to climb through the spokes.

[Southern Tradeway.]

The tradeway runs across the open grasslands northeast towards the Spur, and southwest towards distant lands and eventually, the coast. The plains to the south and east seem totally indifferent to your existence. Just ahead, a small path moves up a village of huts spread out in a semi-circle. In the center of the village a giant fire pit sits where barbarians who wander through the village can sit around to stay warm.  A worn grassy path is here.

The stone paved tradeway stretches across the open plains, interrupting nature's task of consuming the land. An endless sea of grass surrounds you, lapping at the road much like the tides against a beach. The faintly damp wind occasionally blowing in from the west smells of earth. Some of the stones in the road interlock together to form the crude image of a lion. There is no discerning if it was done on purpose or sheer accident.

Only the well-built, stone tradeway gives any hint of civilization ever having had any presence here. The tall grasses limit visibility nearby, hiding any wildlife that may be waiting for prey to stumble too close. A few blades of grass sway slightly in the breeze, some of them broken by the passing of something heavy over them. One of the larger stones in the road, broken loose from its mortar, waits patiently to be repaired.

The grass rises taller and taller in every direction further limiting view just off the roadside. A second glance reveals that this is the lowest point in a large, shallow depression. The tradeway sinks a little lower as it gets closer to the river off to the west. A ditch runs alongside the river's side of the road, small puddles of water filling the bottom. Trickles filter into the puddles from the grass beyond as mosquitoes dart across the muddy surfaces.

Rising up out of the plains, a large walled fort receives the end of the stone road. The river flows from either side, running through the fort from this angle of view. The vegetation surrounding the tradeway at this point has been burned out recently, allowing a clear field of vision from the tops of the walls ahead. The stones show little wear from the heavy traffic of feet and wheels alike; it has certainly been well constructed.

Two guards patrol above the gate, looking you over carefully before giving leave to pass through the heavy wood gate. Thick and long wooden ladders serve up to the guard's posts high in the sky so that they may have some relief from their duties overlooking the land and city. Through the slates of the wooden walkways, you can make out four archers playing a game of cards, weapons at the ready. A whip cracks loudly as a caravan heads out the gate towards Spur.  A glowing wrought iron lantern is here.

Quietly, a yellow and black bumble bee flies around a small garden of fragrant violet orchids while a small bird eats some seed from a bird feeder hung on the walls of the fort. It is startled by approaching footsteps and flies off towards the northeast.

A simple red pavestone path leads from the front gate through a garden of colorful flowers and fragrant herbs. A small fountain bubbles merrily in the middle of the garden. A sturdy oak bench lies almost hidden between some bushes next to the fountain. The path ends at the glass-paneled front door of a wood and stone cottage. Some delicate wind chimes by the front door send beautiful notes ringing through the garden.  A fountain, an open wrought iron gate, and a closed glass paneled door are here.

Tall, sculpted hedges and well groomed gardens decorate the front lawns of various cottages. A cool breeze glides in from the south rustling the branches of a near by oak tree and carrying on it the smell of water. Set into the southern corner is a small, sturdy door. It leads into a small tower that barely rises up over the stockade around it.  An oak tree, some small stone cottages, a closed Leuian crafted koy door, an open wrought iron gate, a closed silver-trimmed etched glass door, and a closed magickal violet gate are here.

Quietly, a yellow and black bumble bee flies around a small garden of fragrant violet orchids while a small bird eats some seed from a bird feeder hung on the walls of the fort. It is startled by approaching footsteps and flies off towards the northeast. A cool breeze carries the sweet scent of flowers, as the sound of distant fresh running water mumbles the whispered conversations of townspeople.  A closed maple door, a cozy cottage, a closed oak cottage door, a Pride Hall, and an exotic violet orchid box are here.

Within the heart of this proud fort one can see all around that the reconstruction of its buildings has begun. Large stones and logs have been stacked and piled, while some workers tirelessly attempt to repair the damage that occurred here during the Lords of Chaos wars. The buildings and homes of the people that resided here are slowly taking shape, though, far from completed. The smell of dyes, used to paint the town, permeate the area.  A breathtaking shimmering bouquet of moonflowers, an open light blue door, and a glowing wrought iron street lantern are here.

Off to the north one can make out the familiar sound of money. The clanking of coins can be heard distinctly. One of the only buildings that happened to survive in this fort from the days of lore, the bank. A small man can be seen traveling to and from the sidewalk to the very spot you are at with his hand held out and a look of sorrow in his eyes.

Behind the counter, busily working away, an old Fir Elf is taking the deposits of the travelers passing through. At another counter a young Usil Elf gives the withdraws to the merchants and passersby. The floor is covered with a bluish-green carpeting that appears quite expensive and hardly scathed by the feet of wanderers. A reddish-brown couch adorned with the furs of many exotic beasts sits in the corner with great appeal to the weary.  An open rough wooden door and a bright wooden sign are here.

Two guards patrol above the gate, looking you over carefully before giving leave to pass through the heavy wood gate. Thick and long wooden ladders serve up to the guard's posts high in the sky so that they may have some relief from their duties overlooking the land and city. Through the slates of the wooden walkways, you can make out four archers playing a game of cards, weapons at the ready. A whip cracks loudly as a caravan heads out the gate towards Spur.  A glowing wrought iron lantern is here.

Standing before you lies the dilapidated remains of a once proud fort. Erected up for many feet one can see the silhouette of a stocky figure far above in what appears to resemble a Guard's Post. Attentive and composed many guards protect this outer wall with their blades and bows.

[Southern Tradeway.]

Rising up out of the plains, a large walled fort receives the end of the stone road. The river flows from either side, running through the fort from this angle of view. The vegetation surrounding the tradeway at this point has been burned out recently, allowing a clear field of vision from the tops of the walls ahead. The stones show little wear from the heavy traffic of feet and wheels alike; it has certainly been well constructed.

The grass rises taller and taller in every direction further limiting view just off the roadside. A second glance reveals that this is the lowest point in a large, shallow depression. The tradeway sinks a little lower as it gets closer to the river off to the west. A ditch runs alongside the river's side of the road, small puddles of water filling the bottom. Trickles filter into the puddles from the grass beyond as mosquitoes dart across the muddy surfaces.

Only the well-built, stone tradeway gives any hint of civilization ever having had any presence here. The tall grasses limit visibility nearby, hiding any wildlife that may be waiting for prey to stumble too close. A few blades of grass sway slightly in the breeze, some of them broken by the passing of something heavy over them. One of the larger stones in the road, broken loose from its mortar, waits patiently to be repaired.

The stone paved tradeway stretches across the open plains, interrupting nature's task of consuming the land. An endless sea of grass surrounds you, lapping at the road much like the tides against a beach. The faintly damp wind occasionally blowing in from the west smells of earth. Some of the stones in the road interlock together to form the crude image of a lion. There is no discerning if it was done on purpose or sheer accident.

The tradeway runs across the open grasslands northeast towards the Spur, and southwest towards distant lands and eventually, the coast. The plains to the south and east seem totally indifferent to your existence. Just ahead, a small path moves up a village of huts spread out in a semi-circle. In the center of the village a giant fire pit sits where barbarians who wander through the village can sit around to stay warm.  A worn grassy path is here.

[Wilderness gate.]

Set within a wide tunnel leading through the hedge to the north is the Wilderness Gate. It separates the settled lands of Spur from the open plains to the south of the city. The plains stretch as far as the eyes can see, the horizon and the walls of the fort down the road the only blemishes of the grassy landscape in the distance. The stones of the road are smoothly set together, well built to withstand heavy travel. A broken wagon wheel, discarded some time ago, covers a spot of nearby grass, weeds trying to climb through the spokes.

Through the gate lies the city of Spur, the major center of trade and civilization on the plains. The dusty road leading through the gates is well traveled, and walls of the city are in good repair. A small shack sits to the west of the road, during most times of the day a dusty coach can be seen waiting in front, its horses stomping with impatience to be gone. To the right of the door is a small window, its opening covered with metal bars. An old man, missing most of his teeth, waits patiently for the travelers to pay their fare, and then directs them into the waiting area. On the east side of the road a billowing multicolored tent has been erected, the hustle and bustle of merchants and customers can be seen coming and going at all times of the day.

The occasional locked gate marks the entrance to some of the more hidden estates of Spurs nobility. From this broad avenue, little can be seen of their splendor. Behind the imposing gate recedes a proud drive, disappearing mysteriously into the trees. If not for the large imposing tower rising above the hedges it would be hard to discern anything was beyond the gate. It is apparent the residents do not wish to be disturbed.

Many stand for a moment as they pass this way, giving thanks for the gift of life that is given by both the apple tree and the Secians of long ago. Large piles of dirt and broken stone lay on either side of the street as workmen ready the east and west alleys for expansion.  A street lantern and a Secian etched moonsilver door are here.

Vast estates tower over the huge Spurian wall towards the south. The well-to-do who live in these homes idle away their days, enjoying the luxury of time.

Behind them, harried servants carry their reticules and all those belongings that they cannot be without.  A street lantern is here.

[Town Square South.]

The outward appearance of the people here seems a bit classier. Rich clothing and large coin purses are prevalent amongst the travelers. In fact, many of the folk heading into Town Square from the south are accompanied by large bodyguards to assure their safety. The well maintained road is lined with small brass lanterns, each swinging off an individual pole. No expense has been spared to keep those who travel this road safe from the hoodlums that relish the darkness.  A street lantern and a large red wooden wagon are here.

[Town Square.]

Commercial buildings flank Town Square to the west and south of this corner. Imposing buildings stand stiffly to your west, while those to the south have a slightly seedy look about them.  The door to the west has a freshly painted sign over it,  "Under New Management."  A closed tan weathered pine door, a large doorway, and a street lantern are here.

[Knowledge Path.]

Before you stands a magnificent white marble temple dedicated to Odarous, the god of chivalry. Ten giant steps made of the same gleaming marble lead up to the temple entrance. Two large statues stand at the base of the stairs, also carved of breath-taking marble. One is a warrior bearing a massive sword and a large shield. The other is a cleric with an amulet bearing the mark of Odarous in one hand and a large mace in the other.  Some gleaming white marble stairs, a polished white marble statue, a polished white marble statue, and a street lantern are here.

A heated discussion breaks out briefly between members of opposing orders of magick. The presence of the city guard rapidly brings an end to the exchange before the verbal debate over power and skill turns into a demonstration.  A street lantern is here.

[Magick Lane.]

A massive circular stone platform stands to the side of Magick Lane, strangely entrancing runes carved on every inch of its sides. The symbol of the god Sa, a golden Dragon, fills the space along the top. Raw power and magick seem to flow from the platform, making the air around it crackle with energy. A small sign stands next to the platform with a single word written upon it.  A rune covered platform, a SIGN, and a street lantern are here.

A low slung building resides on the west side of the street. Chanting can be heard from within.  Occasionally a few sparks rise into the sky, or some unwarranted raindrops begin, but they quickly are quelled. A large pair of wooden doors, their surface carved with rune symbols grace the entrance.  A street lantern and some open rune-etched wooden doors are here.

[Magick Lane.]

A squat ugly little shack stands somber on the eastern side of this well swept lane. A mysterious gothic structure rises from what was once scattered remains of an alchemy shop. A multi-colored stained glass window peers watchful from the crafty western building.  A rotting oak sign, a closed ugly rotting door, a closed arched rosewood gothic door, and a street lantern are here.

A small sign hangs from above the door of the well-kept store before you, telling you that it is a rune shop. The occasional bright flash of light from inside the store suggests all kinds of strange and rare magicks are being cast inside! Those who walk past you glance at the rune shop warily and hurry to get past it as quickly as possible. A small sign hangs from the doorknob of the store that reads "Flerians not allowed!"

[Ragarn's Runes.]

Incredible images cover every free corner of this small store, pictures of every possible rune available for purchase hang from the ceiling, on the walls and some even sit on the floor. Drawn onto scrolls, carved into the wood finish of the building or crafted from any number of other materials, each of the different runes has its own strange feeling of excitement to it. The shop owner looks to know what every one of the runes does.  A large glowing sign, a wooden sign, an intricately carved oak door, and some flaming ruby ashes are here.
