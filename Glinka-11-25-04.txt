[Trail.]

The trail abruptly disappears into a dense wall of foggy mist. The ground here is soggy. Each step sets off a cacophony of buzzing insects, accompanied by the squelching sound of boots being grabbed by slimy muck.

The trail skirts the border of the dismal marsh. Noxious vapors rise from the stagnant waters that lap at the noticeably narrowing route. What had been a dark green haze can now be distinguished as a massive forest.

Murky water has encroached upon the trail, making the way treacherous. A careful survey of the watery surroundings shows a faint path veering sharply to the north, away from the marsh and toward the forest.

[Riverside.]

The footbridge that once connected this path to its match on the other side of the overflowing rushing river is now nothing more then a few charred pilings. Tiny insects buzz around their remains, finding a comfortable new home. Lashed to the remains of one of the more sturdy pilings is a tall steel pole. Wrapped around the pole, and tied securely is a taut rope. Bobbing ever so lightly due to the strain of the riverboat, the rope holds tight.  A flowing river, a freshly painted sign, and some carved oak benches are here.

The footbridge that once connected this path to its match on the other side of the overflowing rushing river is now nothing more then a few charred pilings. Tiny insects buzz around their remains, finding a comfortable new home. Lashed to the remains of one of the more sturdy pilings is a tall steel pole. Wrapped around the pole, and tied securely is a taut rope. Bobbing ever so lightly due to the strain of the riverboat, the rope holds tight.  A flowing river, a freshly painted sign, and some carved oak benches are here.

This area is illuminated.
In the area are Vallek the Frontacian, Noffbrau the Noble Hithual, Kelthazod the San Elf, Renalk the Noble San Elf, Anyah the Human, and Solinus the Human (holding a flaming golden brass lantern).

Renalk smiles at Binx.

Binx steps through the glowing multicolored portal and vanishes!
You feel a shifting sensation...
[Riverside.]

Swollen beyond its banks, the once small creek is now a rushing overflowing river. What used to be the charred footbridge is now a safe haven for fish well down river, nothing left of its structure. Set well into the bank of the river is a long steel pole. Lashed to the pole is a heavy rope. The voice of the riverboat captain can be heard echoing across the water, taking command and moving his cargo.  A flowing river, a freshly painted sign, some carved oak benches, a large pool of mud, and a riverboat are here.

This area is illuminated.
In the area are Vallek the Frontacian, Autumn the Fir Elf, Feletia the Draco, Alwin the Secian (flying 5 feet above you and holding a glowing lantern), Noffbrau the Noble Hithual, Kelthazod the San Elf, Binx the Secian (flying beside you and holding a glowing pale blue flame), Renalk the Noble San Elf, Anyah the Human, Owynn the Fir Elf, and Solinus the Human (holding a flaming golden brass lantern).

[Bubbling forest stream.]

The path here turns due west, climbing the river bank towards taller evergreen trees. The river rumbles loudly, singing its ancient tune. North of the river, fir and cedar begin to dominate while the deciduous varieties fade.  Some fresh flowering sprouts are here.

[Forest Path.]

The path continues to the west through a mix of moss covered Fir and Alder trees. Further to the west, taller trees designate the incline of a hill. All around the trunks of the taller trees, a large patch of glossy leafed ivy spreads over the burned remains of the old city.  Several charred planks lay in piles under the proliferous ivy as nature's cycle of renewal chews, burrows, disintegrates and mulches the wood back to the soil.  Some mossy Fir trees and some majestic ivy covered Alder trees are here.

[Forest Path.]

The path forks to the northwest and northeast. You spot the tracks of a deer, and looking around, notice the antler-scraped bark of a nearby tree. The healthy smell of the forest surrounds you, but the hill to the southwest keeps you from enjoying it.  A broken and cracked steelwood tree is here.

[Forest path.]

The breeze is coming from the north, yet a feeling of dread comes from the south, down the loathsome hill, along a series of rock carved steps.  The forest is unnaturally quiet, as you peer up to the top of the hill.  Some steps leading up are here.

[Forest path.]

You step over a small rivulet of water running down from the hill here. The stream seems to be reviving, and even small insects flitter about, but quickly scurry away.  The forest here is eerily still, and you hope this path is going to lead away from this hill soon.  A small flowing rivulet is here.

[Branch in forest path.]

The path branches, leading off in three directions here. The trees here, begin to become more deciduous as you go south. Ferns brush at your feet as you walk. Tangles of blackberries looking quite good, grow on the hill. Dare you eat them?

[Forest End]

The trees end suddenly as you have come to an immensely wide canyon.  A bridge at one time led across to the other side.  Now, however, the bridge is broken and looks to be beyond repair. Across the ravine you see nothing but rock and barren landscape.  A crumbling bridge is here.

All around the trunks of the taller trees, a large patch of glossy leafed ivy spreads over the burned remains of the old city.  Several charred planks lay in piles under the proliferous ivy as nature's cycle of renewal chews, burrows, disintegrates and mulches the wood back to the soil.  Some mossy Fir trees and some majestic ivy covered Alder trees are here.

Swollen beyond its banks, the once small creek is now a rushing overflowing river. What used to be the charred footbridge is now a safe haven for fish well down river, nothing left of its structure. Set well into the bank of the river is a long steel pole. Lashed to the pole is a heavy rope. The voice of the riverboat captain can be heard echoing across the water, taking command and moving his cargo.  A flowing river, a freshly painted sign, some carved oak benches, and a large pool of mud are here.

The few lone fir trees that once stood mighty in this open plain have been broken in half and thrown casually to the side. The earth has been ripped up, exposing the dark black soil underneath.

A circle of tall, gray stones surrounds a vine-covered stump, as though protecting it from prying eyes.  Approaching the stump, you can almost feel it pulse with a hidden energy, as if it still has some life within it.  Markings decorate its top, although the overgrowth obscures most of it.  An overgrown path and a twisted black orchid are here.

You realize this hidden spot is not visible from the edge of great forest across the ravine. Lush grass covers the ground surrounding a shimmering pure moonsilver pool; its surface reflecting the beauty of the skies above.  A steep slope and a path along the cliff are here.

A matched pair of dapple grays stand in front of the shack waiting to take their human baggage to their destination. To the left of the door, behind a small paned window, a beautiful Fir Elf female takes coin and in return, with a charming smile, directs those who have paid their fare into the waiting room.  A small shack, a freshly painted sign, a notice of non-refund, and a small winding stone pathway are here.

Carefully winding its way up the base of the tree, and wrapping itself around the stairs, a flowering jasmine vine grows tall and lush. Dark scars from a past fire are almost hidden under tufts of fresh growth and moss. A large gap, nearly sixteen feet in distance, rests between the base of a set of stairs and the forest floor. A long moonsilver cord hangs down the side of the tree. If one pulls it, the long Elven rope will descend from above, allowing them to enter the great city of Treehaven. Bright green leaves of clover have begun springing up through the ashy soil in conjunction with soft moss to lend a durable cushion to this well-traveled spot.  Some vine-covered steps circling the tree, a freshly painted wooden sign, a healthy green patch of clover, a flowing marble fountain, some clover shaped stones, some sweet scented flowering jasmine vines, and a long woven moonsilver cord are here.

Patches of razor-grass grow sporadically along the path. The area has a heavy, lingering scent of an unfamiliar beast. The growth to the side of the path has been flattened in a huge circumference, where whatever it was apparently slept for some time.

Carefully winding its way up the base of the tree, and wrapping itself around the stairs, a flowering jasmine vine grows tall and lush. Dark scars from a past fire are almost hidden under tufts of fresh growth and moss. A large gap, nearly sixteen feet in distance, rests between the base of a set of stairs and the forest floor. A long moonsilver cord hangs down the side of the tree. If one pulls it, the long Elven rope will descend from above, allowing them to enter the great city of Treehaven. Bright green leaves of clover have begun springing up through the ashy soil in conjunction with soft moss to lend a durable cushion to this well-traveled spot.  Some vine-covered steps circling the tree, a freshly painted wooden sign, a healthy green patch of clover, a flowing marble fountain, some clover shaped stones, some sweet scented flowering jasmine vines, and a long woven moonsilver cord are here.

The path of four leaf clove shaped flagstones leads past a small clean shack and into a well formed tunnel through the thorn bushes to the east and the Caersech to the west. The small shack is set back from the road, its walls built of a whitewashed birch. A sturdy corral, filled with well-fed horses, stands to the left of the shack. A matched pair of dapple grays stand in front of the shack waiting to take their human baggage to their destination. To the left of the door, behind a small paned window, a beautiful Fir Elf female takes coin and in return, with a charming smile, directs those who have paid their fare into the waiting room.  A small shack, a freshly painted sign, a notice of non-refund, and a small winding stone pathway are here.

Oddly shaped yellow rocks line the entrance to the cave. Sharp and jagged, they jut from the cave floor, forming a semi-circle. Protruding from the rather low ceiling of the cave are more rocks in a matching formation.  The effect is that of stalagmites and stalactites, striving to meet. The floor of the cave is littered with rock fragments, making passage slow and difficult.

The narrow muddy path ends at the edge of a deep blue pool. Overhead, the waters of the forest stream gush out into the frothing river. A gentler cascade trickles down the rock face of the chasm, creating a double waterfall. The hardened mud to one side of the path holds the impressions and footsteps of a struggle that occurred here, and a few scattered scales that were dislodged during the battle are becoming petrified into the surroundings by the deposits from the mist of the double waterfall. A rock shelf rests a few feet above the pool, housing an inviting combination of moss and clover.  A beautiful flowing waterfall, a deep blue pool, and a soft mossy patch of clover are here.

As the sounds of the waterfall echo from the southeast, the waters of the lake glimmer in the available light, and the boggy air lightens up considerably. Across the lake to the north and west, the dense green forest rises, and the hoots and calls of various forest creatures becomes faintly apparent against the soothing background noise of the running water.

Thick, slimy bubbles emerge to the surface of the deep bog and burst with a sickening sound that startles the prey of a nearby snake into hopping away at the last second. Low-hanging cypress branches shade the already dark waters, making them appear much more sinister than the surrounding bog. Somehow life still must go on here,as the splashing of fish diving beneath the exposed roots of the trees can still be heard.

Muddy footprints lead from the deeper waters of the bog up toward the edge of the muck.  Oddly enough, there are no footprints coming the other way, as if some large creature crawled out of the sludge to shore. Tiny winged insects buzz all around you, creating eerie harmonies with their wings. Cypress leaves are scattered all throughout the area, with some floating lazily in the waters and others stuck comically atop mounds of mud.

To the west, the brilliantly clear waters of the lake glitter with schools of leaping silverback fish. The view is a startling contrast to the ominously dark waters that make up the home for the bog's denizens. Even the bird nesting in nearby cypress trees seem depressed when they lean their heads down to clean the mud off their feet. The view east seems darker still as the bog waters deepen into blackness.

The vegetation that covers the logs are noticeably healthier than the scraggly trees that inhabit the rest of the bog.  Some rotting mossy sprout-covered logs are here.

The area brightens.
[Muddy Bog.]

As the elevation drops to the west, this muddy bog gives way to a large lake. Clear paths are visible along the walls of the ravine to both the southwest and northwest, venturing to the center of the bog will require careful foot placement to avoid the stagnant pools and deep muck. Walking through the dark waters that pools atop the sludge beneath can prove dangerous for even the most sure-footed hunter.

This area is illuminated.
In the area are Autumn the Fir Elf, Binx the Secian (holding a glowing pale blue flame), Alwin the Secian, Noffbrau the Noble Hithual, Kelthazod the San Elf, Renalk the Noble San Elf, Anyah the Human, Owynn the Fir Elf, and Solinus the Human.
Obvious paths: east west northwest*.

As you look at what lies before you a feeling somewhere between amazment and terror fills your mind.  You're standing at the anchor point of what you can easily admit to be the largest spider web you have ever seen.  Huge strands of silk extend to symmetrical anchor points around the web.  These strands show no sign of adhesive material, they are simply the foundation for which the rest is built on.  You feel that with a fair amount of caution you could walk on it.  Behind you, the passage out has been sealed closed once again.

The natural sounds of the forest intertwine in a natural symphonic arrangement of chirps, squeaks, howls and hoots of the various creatures that populate this ancient glen. The busy animals follow their daily routines while keeping a wary eye on the intruders of their private forest.

Whispering ancient lore of powerful foresters, the wind returns those secrets to a new generation here in the Caersech. Thick with moss and leaves, a web of vines interconnects the branches above. Their varying thicknesses are suitable for a great number of tree-dwelling creatures to navigate the lush canopy. Several large jagged boulders, to the north of the glen, are piled on top of each other. Flowing crystal water pushes its way over the top of them creating a misting waterfall and a pool of water below. Winding its way north, a large flowing stream creates moisture in the air which is rich with the aroma of long-forgotten forests.  A pile of jagged boulders, a waterfall, and a large flowing stream are here.

The roaring sound of the river overwhelms most other sounds as one travels along the rocky path that shadows its serpentine shape. A small chunk of wood swiftly passes, bobbing on the foamy rapids. Large, smooth rocks are piled near the riverbank, by an ancient flood. A deweybird hops among them, looking for some juicy waterbugs. Along the side of the river, a small cottage stands boarded up. The ivy has over grown around the gate and the mailbox door is hanging from one hinge.  A damaged old ivy-covered gate boarded up and a damaged sapphire blue mailbox are here.

A few markings on some nearby tree trunks tell the story of deer racks and bear claws being cleaned.

Several patches of clover create a lush cushion at the base of the tree and boast several lovely purple flowers. Set carefully at the edge of the forest, a small thatched hut has been built. A small plume of smoke rises from the tiny chimney that rests on the roof.

Whispering ancient lore of powerful foresters, the wind returns those secrets to a new generation here in the Caersech. Thick with moss and leaves, a web of vines interconnects the branches above. Their varying thicknesses are suitable for a great number of tree-dwelling creatures to navigate the lush canopy. Several large jagged boulders, to the north of the glen, are piled on top of each other. Flowing crystal water pushes its way over the top of them creating a misting waterfall and a pool of water below. Winding its way north, a large flowing stream creates moisture in the air which is rich with the aroma of long-forgotten forests.  A pile of jagged boulders, a waterfall, and a large flowing stream are here.

A long moonsilver cord hangs down the side of the tree. If one pulls it, the long Elven rope will descend from above, allowing them to enter the great city of Treehaven. Bright green leaves of clover have begun springing up through the ashy soil in conjunction with soft moss to lend a durable cushion to this well-traveled spot.

Ravens dark as pitch spread their feathers to a wing-span of nearly four feet, so large they are, as they quarrel over an abandoned mule carcass on the roadside breaks out. How final death seems, so casually nature simply encompasses the bodies of the fallen, through carrion hunters or moldy decay. Yet through death there be life again, any number of these ravens being sustained through this death, so they may live. Perhaps only to become sustenance for one of the swamp creatures, who, in turn, spends its life continuing the cycle.

Eyes of creatures too quick to be seen monitor your progress along the road.

A sudden shift in the wind brings forth the sullied aroma of death and decay from the swamp southern lands.

The open plains are becoming scattered with scraggly trees, the wood of which proving inefficient to use for building as the elements of nature have grown the trunks so twisted and hard in order to withstand the onslaughts of time. Circling around the northern base of a small hill, there lies the lapping edge of the swamp to the south. Small slimy creatures lie on the smooth stones near the water, darting into it at the speed of light as you near them with tiny splashes and echoing wakes blending into the small, gentle waves coming into the shore. Swarms of mosquitoes move along the land in unison, lending them the appearance of large, unified bodies hovering around for the next feast.

A hedge of spiky brambles forms a natural division from the lands and the swampy terrain to the south. Tall, limbless trees dot the horizon there, their bases lost in the misty depths of the gases hovering over the waters. Now and then a strange, growling sound echos up to the north, or an odd, high-pitched call of some unseen crow, probably feasting on a fallen creature hidden in the mists. The path curves away from the sounds, as popular choice has preferred to travel around the edges, rather than through the marshy sludge.

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.   A flowing white marble fountain, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a marble statue of a Human, a rosewood sign, and a turkey etched crystal tray are here.

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.   A flowing white marble fountain, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a marble statue of a Human, a rosewood sign, a turkey etched crystal tray, and some thick silver-trimmed riding boots are here.

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.

Guards carefully eye all that enter or exit the city, beckoning gruffly to random travelers for a closer inspection. The structure of the guards' barracks is visible above the road to the west. A weathered wooden sign is posted by the gate.  An open stone gate, a wooden sign, an open thick stone door, and a street lantern are here.

[Noble Way.]

The occasional locked gate marks the entrance to some of the more hidden estates of Spurs nobility. From this broad avenue, little can be seen of their splendor. Behind the imposing gate recedes a proud drive, disappearing mysteriously into the trees. If not for the large imposing tower rising above the hedges it would be hard to discern anything was beyond the gate. It is apparent the residents do not wish to be disturbed.  A street lantern, a closed morbius door, and an open black iron gate are here.

Majestic elms continue to line this broad roadway, sheltering the avenue on both sides and further enhancing the grandiose atmosphere. Fronting the beautiful homes, cobbled paths edged with narrow flower beds meander through nearby private gardens. Though they appear wonderful places to spend an afternoon or take a picnic, the glances from those tending the estates makes it clear they are only for the invited.  A street lantern is here.

Through the gate lies the city of Spur, the major center of trade and civilization on the plains. The dusty road leading through the gates is well traveled, and walls of the city are in good repair. A small shack sits to the west of the road, during most times of the day a dusty coach can be seen waiting in front, its horses stomping with impatience to be gone. To the right of the door is a small window, its opening covered with metal bars. An old man, missing most of his teeth, waits patiently for the travelers to pay their fare, and then directs them into the waiting area. On the east side of the road a billowing multicolored tent has been erected, the hustle and bustle of merchants and customers can be seen coming and going at all times of the day.  An open iron gate and a rainbow silk tent are here.

Even though it shows heavy wear, the road is in remarkably good repair. It was built by expert craftsmen to withstand the rigors of time and use. Evidence of recent repairs indicate that any problems are dealt with quickly and competently.  Some dried crimson streaks of blood and a closed old wooden trash wagon are here.

Off along the north branch of the road is a large gatehouse. It stands at the base of a broad hill that seems to follow the city wall as it angles off to the northeast. The farmer's field to the south is neat and carefully tended.
