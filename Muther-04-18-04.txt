

Tiruna says in Leuian, "well , I thinks we will officially get started"


Tiruna says to Reyilion in Leuian, "I would love to hear this story of the khit"


Tiruna says in Leuian, "since Gwena has short time"



Tiruna says in Leuian, "would you be so kind as to start tonight"


Reyilion says in Leuian, "I will"

Tiruna nods to Reyilion.

Reyilion says in Leuian, "I have little to say, and I had hoped others interested would have been here, but..."


Reyilion says in Leuian, "We all can be sleepy at times"



Tiruna says in Leuian, "it will be in our minutes"

Reyilion says in Leuian, "Aye. I have been told about the khits Ward found. But not much really except what I'd read"

Tiruna nods to Reyilion.

Reyilion says in Leuian, "I also know the other two have been sent to Leuia, by my 'sara"

Audun nods to Reyilion.

Gwena raises an eyebrow.

Tiruna nods up and down.

Tiruna says in Leuian, "they are safe and loved"

Shaleu nods.

Reyilion says in Leuian, "When approached I did not know why....and after a few vauge statements the story of this third khit was somewhat told to me"


Tiruna says in Leuian, "the one we were told was dead "

Reyilion says in Leuian, "I was also told it was.....forcibly taken from Tchori"




Gwena says in Leuian, "hmm."

Gwena asks in Leuian, "How did Tchori get it?"

Reyilion says to Gwena in Leuian, "Was given to him as far as I know"

Gwena nods.

Shaleu says in Leuian, "some lakars attacke Faith and some other tarrs"

Gwena asks in Leuian, "Who took it from Tchori?"

Reyilion shakes his head from side to side.

Reyilion says in Leuian, "I do not know"

Shaleu says in Leuian, "they got the khit and gave it to Tchori"

Gwena nods to Shaleu.

Shaleu says in Leuian, "then they came after Tchori and killed him and got it back"

Draejlen growls quietly.

>
Tiruna listens intently to Reyilion.

Reyilion says in Leuian, "However, the khit was given to me to still any threats 'about' the khit against the serpent temple."

Tiruna says in Leuian, "wait"

Reyilion raises an eyebrow.

Tiruna says in Leuian, "let me see if I have this right"

Tiruna asks in Leuian, "the khit was given to you , so the serpents wouldn't be attacked over it?"

Reyilion nods up and down.

Audun asks in Leuian, "Ye have it now?"

Tiruna laughs deeply.

Reyilion grins at Tiruna.

Tiruna says in Leuian, "they truly don't know us , do they"


Reyilion says to Tiruna in Leuian, "No they do, I'm guessing they'd rather be attacked for the normal reasons"

Reyilion shrugs slightly.

Tiruna says in Leuian, "is this poor khit safe and sound"



Reyilion says in Leuian, "He's not left my sight"

Draejlen listens intently and writes 'no invisibles present'.

Audun purrs softly.

Tiruna says in Leuian, "this poor child"

Reyilion nods at Tiruna.

Audun asks in Leuian, "Do ye have this khit with ye now?"

Gwena asks in Leuian, "Are you sure sending it to Leuia is the proper course of action?"

Gwena asks in Leuian, "What of it's parents?"

Shaleu says in Leuian, "it is"

Audun says to Gwena in Leuian, "'Twas decided by all."

Tiruna says in Leuian, "to join the khits siblings"

Audun nods.

Shaleu says in Leuian, "the other two were sent "

Tiruna says in Leuian, "there are two others over there now"

Gwena raises an eyebrow at Audun.

Draejlen asks in Leuian, "Has Tchori been told? He will be so relieved.1"

Gwena asks in Leuian, "What about the khit's parents?"

Shaleu says in Leuian, "we believe the are dead"

Gwena says in Leuian, "But you don't know."

Tiruna says in Leuian, "no khit's parents woulda been silent this long"

Draejlen says in Leuian, "oh pardon me..."

Audun says to Gwena in Leuian, "We don't know who the parents are, but 'tis not anyone we know. We felt the only way the khits would fall into serpent hands was if the parents were murdered."

Audun twitches his tail.

Tiruna says in Leuian, "to have their triplets stolen"

Gwena says to Tiruna in Leuian, "They may not know."

Shaleu says in Leuian, "Gwena I believe they were killed but it is awhile ago"

Audun says in Leuian, "And if they were alive, they would surely have come to us for aid. None have done so."

Tiruna says in Leuian, "has been quite awhile ago"

Reyilion furrows his brow and scratches at his left shoulder.

Audun says in Leuian, "Been a good long time, aye."

Shaleu says in Leuian, "Ward advertised them for sale"

Tiruna says in Leuian, "some were trying to buy them to torture them"

Shaleu says in Leuian, "there was bidding from all the dishonorable lakars"

Shaleu shudders.

Gwena says in Leuian, "Perhaps the parents cannot read.  I suggest that a city-wide announcement be made that the parents are being searched for and see if any come forth."


Gwena says in Leuian, "If no one comes forth to claim the khit, then send it to Leuia, by all means."

Tiruna says to Gwena in Leuian, "sister, there was a huge announcement"



Tiruna says in Leuian, "the whole of Aradath knew"

Reyilion says in Leuian, "Ward also conveyed his regret on how he handled the situation from the beginning...."

Reyilion twitches his tail.

Gwena says in Leuian, "Well, let us hope so."

Gwena blinks at Reyilion.

Tiruna snorts.

Shaleu says in Leuian, "it was believed this one was dead, Ward said so anyway"

Gwena asks in Leuian, "Ward was regretful?"



Reyilion says in Leuian, "Yes I know it's hard for you all to believe"

Tiruna says in Leuian, "after he told us all that one had died"

Gwena furrows her brow.

Reyilion says in Leuian, "He regretted that as well"

Audun says in Leuian, "What he thinks matters not to me."

Draejlen sighs.

Reyilion nods.

Shaleu says in Leuian, "is that why he came to my cottage and killed me"

Reyilion flinches.

Tiruna says in Leuian, "what matters is that this khit be sent to where it will never be 'baggage' again"

Shaleu says in Leuian, "because he regretted loosing the khits"

Tiruna says in Leuian, "to be passed around from serpent to serpent"

Reyilion says to Shaleu in Leuian, "No"

Shaleu rubs the glimmering white pearl khat'sara band.

Reyilion sits down.

Gwena twitches her tail.

Hott says, "be carful of listening to forked tongues"

Shaleu sits down.

Draejlen says in Leuian, "I passed Ward at the south gate on my way here... he has no idea that I know who he is."

Tiruna says to Reyilion in Leuian, "brother"

Tiruna nuzzles Reyilion.

Tchori just entered through an open leather door.

Tchori bows.

Gwena sighs.

Tchori sits down.
bow to tc

Draejlen bows to Tchori.

>
Hott says in Leuian, "he knows who I am"

Tiruna says in Leuian, "please quickly send the khit to be with his siblings in Leuia, to the same family that has so lovingly cared for the other too"

Muther asks, " did the khits have names?"

Tiruna says in Leuian, "twould be good to get this khit to safety"

Shaleu shakes her head from side to side.

Tiruna nuzzles Tchori.

Hott searches the room.

Audun says in Leuian, "They were too young to speak."


Gwena says to Reyilion in Leuian, "Let us see the khit."

Reyilion frowns slightly.

Draejlen beams at Tchori.

>
Reyilion just opened the closed warm fur-lined buckskin sling.

Reyilion just removed a reddish black furred Leuian khit from within his open warm fur-lined buckskin sling.

Audun purrs softly.

Tiruna sighs.

Gwena nods slightly.

Hott says in Leuian, "ah"

Reyilion purrs softly to himself.

Tchori says in Leuian, "makes one wonder why the tarr returned the khit"

Muther asks, " could the pride not raise such a one?"


Draejlen purrs.

Shaleu smiles sadly.

Reyilion says to Tchori in Leuian, "The reason I gave has already been laughed at"

Tiruna says in Leuian, "I am sure in Leuia, he will grow fast "

Gwena says to Reyilion in Leuian, "Thank you."

Shaleu shakes her head from side to side.

Reyilion nods to Gwena.

Tchori raises an eyebrow.

Reyilion just placed a reddish black furred Leuian khit within his open warm fur-lined buckskin sling.

Tchori asks in Leuian, "what reason is that?"


Reyilion just closed the open warm fur-lined buckskin sling.


Tiruna asks in Leuian, "that he regretted how he handled his stealing of the khits and the attempt to sell them and the lie that this one was dead?"

Audun says in Leuian, "We spoke on that 'fore we sent the other two to Leuia. Best to take them far away from the serpents, and 'tis best that this one be reunited with siblings too."

Reyilion straps a closed warm fur-lined buckskin sling to his back.


Tchori says in Leuian, "it may shed some light on his reasons if its known that i spoke with slade on the matter"

Tiruna says in Leuian, "poor khit is far smaller than his siblings already"


Muther asks, " were all males?"

Draejlen nods up and down to Tiruna.

Shaleu nods.

Tiruna says in Leuian, "one girl"

Shaleu says in Leuian, "the little white one was a female"

Tiruna says in Leuian, "two males"

Shaleu says in Leuian, "so sweet "

Draejlen purrs.


Muther says, " a white"


Reyilion says in Leuian, "Almost looks like I did as a khit"

Reyilion fidgets slightly.

Tiruna says in Leuian, "hold the khit close to your heart, Rey"

Reyilion glances at the closed warm fur-lined buckskin sling.

>
Reyilion sighs softly.

Tiruna says in Leuian, "untill you can get him to his family in Leuia"

Reyilion nods at Tiruna.

Shaleu says in Leuian, "I had the two in my cottage for 2 nights"

You nod softly.
>
Shaleu says in Leuian, "was so fun to have khits around again"

Shaleu mutters tiring too.

Audun purrs softly.



Muther says, " must have broken yuor heart to let them go"

Gwena ponders.

Tiruna says in Leuian, "until my dying day , I will never forget the theft of these khits and the attempt to sell them as if they were property, slaves"

Audun twitches his tail.

Audun holds Tiruna close.

Reyilion nods at Tiruna.

Shaleu says in Leuian, "yes and no-one wants what is best alwasy for the little ones"

Draejlen smiles.

Tiruna says in Leuian, "nor will I ever forget who attempted to buy them"

Tiruna says in Leuian, "nor what they stated they would do to them"

Reyilion removes his heavy eagle etched bone platemail.

Reyilion coughs softly.

Gwena just placed a heavy golden lionskin pelt within her open large black leather backpack.

Tiruna says in Leuian, "thank you Rey"

Gwena ponders.

Reyilion nods at Tiruna.

Tiruna says in Leuian, "and thank you Tchori for the words you had with that thing, Slade"

Draejlen smiles at Tchori.

Tiruna says in Leuian, "might we ponder a moment the parents , who we must assume were killed somehow"

Tiruna says in Leuian, "they are looking down now, and finally can be at peace"

Tchori blinks.

Hott just opened the closed platinum trimmed teak traveling case.

Draejlen nods up and down.

Tiruna says in Leuian, "their last one, will be safe , finally"

Tiruna gazes up at the stars.

Audun nods solemnly.

Tiruna inhales.

Tiruna stands up.

Tiruna asks in Leuian, "is there more on this matter?"

Draejlen beams at Tiruna.

Draejlen beams at Hott.

Tiruna smiles over at Rey.

Reyilion smiles faintly at Tiruna.

Tiruna says in Leuian, "I want to remind you all, that a khit is most precious to all of us"

Draejlen nods up and down.



Tiruna says in Leuian, "tis our duty as Pride to make sure all orphaned khits are taken care of the best way we can"

Tiruna says in Leuian, "and woe unto those that harm our khits"


Tiruna says in Leuian, "I've got a few things to bring up"

Tiruna says in Leuian, "one is fun"

Tiruna says in Leuian, "one is serious"

Tiruna says in Leuian, "I ask you which would you like to hear first"

Tiruna swishes her tail sassily.

Reyilion says in Leuian, "Fun last"

Reyilion smiles faintly.

Gwena says in Leuian, "Serious first."

Draejlen says in Leuian, "Yes, fun last"

Tiruna says in Leuian, "well Rey spoke first so be it"

Draejlen says in Leuian, "leave us with a positive note"

Tiruna inhales.

Tiruna paces.




Tiruna glances around.

Tiruna says in Leuian, "okay here goes"

Draejlen listens intently to Tiruna.

Hott nods.

Tiruna says in Leuian, "and trust me, I am very clearly speaking as your Khatyra right now"

Tiruna paces.

Tiruna says in Leuian, "we are leuians"



Tiruna says in Leuian, "Our People, we , do not tolerate nor do we ever support serpents"

Draejlen nods up and down.

Audun twitches his tail.

Tiruna says in Leuian, "and no Rey, this is not about you getting the khits from Ward"

Hott nods.

Reyilion says to Tiruna in Leuian, "Nay, but you could point other things at me"

Draejlen smiles at Hott.

Reyilion winks at Tiruna.

Tiruna says in Leuian, "nor Tchori, is this about you trying to save the khit by talking to that thing Slade"

Tiruna says in Leuian, "this is about going hunting with tarrs"

Audun grunts.

Reyilion ponders the meaning of the universe for a moment.

Hott snarls.

Tiruna says in Leuian, "about kyn stating publically that we should not hate all serpents"

Shaleu frowns.

Tiruna says in Leuian, "well let me tell you"

Tiruna says in Leuian, "Our People do not every honorably hunt with serpents"


Tiruna says in Leuian, "nor do they say things like , well he's a serpent , but why should I judge him on his godmark"

Tiruna says in Leuian, "he's been nice to me"


Tiruna says in Leuian, "this has come up over and over again"

Audun twitches his tail.

Tiruna says in Leuian, "and it will is not acceptable"





Tiruna asks in Leuian, "is there anyone here right now who disagrees with me?"


Shaleu shakes her head from side to side.

Tiruna says in Leuian, "now I seldom speak this strongly"

Yinnin reveals himself.

Yinnin leans on Gwena.

>
Audun says to Tiruna in Leuian, "I love it when ye do, though."

Audun smiles lightly.

Draejlen raises an eyebrow at Yinnin.


Tiruna says in Leuian, "but anyone who follows the serpent is not our friend and never will be"

>
Yinnin swishes his tail.

Reyilion glances at Tiruna.

Tiruna says in Leuian, "a cleric is in my eyes even worse than a simple thief"

Gwena nuzzles Yinnin.

Draejlen beams at Shaleu.

Yinnin purrs quietly.

Yinnin nuzzles Gwena.

Tiruna says in Leuian, "for they steal souls by lying about the basic nature of their god of deception and lies"

Tiruna says in Leuian, "I am not in any way saying we should go out and kill every serpent we see"

Tiruna says in Leuian, "some are young, some believe the lies"

Hott says in Leuian, "humm"

Tiruna says in Leuian, "but we , as leuians, at least should hold to the truth and to our culture"

Tiruna says in Leuian, "does anyone at all disagree with this"

Draejlen shakes his head from side to side.

Tiruna says in Leuian, "pleas speak if you do, we are all free here, if you don't agree please speak up ,and we will spend time on it"

Audun says in Leuian, "Can't imagine that anyone would."

Draejlen listens intently and scribes away.

Audun twitches his tail.

Hott raises his hand.

Tiruna says in Leuian, "hott"

Saberus just entered through an open leather door.
l

Saberus bows towards all.

>
Tiruna nuzzles Saberus.

Hott stands up.

Saberus purrs.

Saberus sits down.


Audun nods respectfully to Saberus.

>
Saberus grins.

Tchori smiles at Saberus.

Tchori bows.

Reyilion nods to Saberus.

Shaleu smiles at Saberus.

>
Draejlen smiles at Saberus.

Yinnin swishes his tail at Saberus.

Saberus swishes his tail once.

Hott asks in Leuian, "when they steal from ye --kill um?"

Tiruna says in Leuian, "if you so choose"

Tiruna says in Leuian, "actually , as my Audun says, never is wrong to kill a serpent"

Gwena ponders.

Hott says in Leuian, "ok just wondered"

Tiruna says in Leuian, "but if they be very young"

Audun nuzzles Tiruna.

Audun nods.

Reyilion frowns.

Draejlen smiles at Saberus.

Tiruna says in Leuian, "I would think you would take that into consideration"


Tiruna says in Leuian, "might be better just to chase them all over the place and threaten them if they be young"

Shaleu says in Leuian, "there are those time that you may persuade them to try a more honest life"

Tiruna says in Leuian, "remember young is young"

Audun says in Leuian, "Aye, 'tis never wrong to kill their kind, but I generally find it best to simply ignore them. Got better things to do in life than exterminate sewer rats."

Hott asks in Leuian, "then just kick their tail?"

Hott says in Leuian, "done"

Tiruna says to Hott in Leuian, "you been walking this land a long time, you do what you feel is right"

Tiruna nuzzles Hott.

Gwena raises her hand.

Hott sits down.

Reyilion's stomach growls.

Tiruna says in Leuian, "I want to talk about kyn who instead of wondering if we should kill the serpents, wonder why we don't nuzzzle them"

Tiruna says in Leuian, "tis a whole different thing"

Tiruna says in Leuian, "Gwena"

Reyilion blinks.


Gwena says to Tiruna in Leuian, "While we are on the subject of dealing with serpents..."

Shaleu nods.

Draejlen purrs.

Gwena asks Tchori in Leuian, "May I please inquire why you were dealing in information with the cleric of the serpent known as Khoman?  It has been bothering me for sometime."

Draejlen glances at Tchori and continues to scribe.

Tchori asks in Leuian, "khoman?"

Hott just placed a small breathtaking grey pearl within his open leather trimmed canvas rucksack.

Gwena nods to Tchori.

Gwena says in Leuian, "He is a San."

Hott withdraws his earlier offer.

Draejlen smiles at Hott.


Tchori says in Leuian, "ahh.. an elf.. to be honest, unless they are kyn i rarely check to see who they are, unless i have a past with them"

Reyilion ponders the meaning of the universe for a moment.

Tchori asks in Leuian, "what was i doing with it?"

Reyilion accepts Hott's offer.

Gwena says to Tchori in Leuian, "That is my question."

Gwena says to Tchori in Leuian, "He told me that he had the information you had paid him for."

Reyilion smiles faintly.

Tiruna asks in Leuian, "he told you?"

Tchori blinks.

Tchori says in Leuian, "i paid for nothing"

Shaleu chuckles.

Gwena says to Tchori in Leuian, "And when I informed you, you nodded to me, quite as if you knew of what I spoke of."

Gwena furrows her brow.

Gwena says in Leuian, "So, I am confused and bothered by this."

Yinnin swishes his tail.

Tiruna says to Tchori in Leuian, "I told you about nodding without listening before"

Tiruna mutters something beneath her breath.

Tchori says in Leuian, "i think he confused it.. i think i may have gotten clothing for him.. i can check if you wish"

Saberus sighs and looks distant.

Gwena furrows her brow.

Tiruna says in Leuian, "okay Tchori you check on that"

Gwena says to Tchori in Leuian, "No, it wasn't clothing.  I asked him."

Gwena says to Tchori in Leuian, "He quite clearly told me it was information."

Tiruna furrows her brow.

Gwena shrugs a shoulder.

Tiruna says in Leuian, "and you believe the serpent"

Tchori blinks.

Draejlen listens intently and scribes a little more thoughtfully.

Tchori frowns.

Tiruna says in Leuian, "again kyn, let me get back to my initial statement"

Gwena asks Tiruna in Leuian, "The serpent said to me, "Do you see Tchori often?""

Hott says in Leuian, "like i said watch out for forked tongues"

Tiruna says in Leuian, "WE do NOT listen nor deal with serpents"

Tchori nods to Gwena.

Tiruna listens intently to Gwena.

Gwena says in Leuian, "When I told him that, yes, I do see Tchori often, he said that he was looking for him, and had been trying to contact him."

Gwena says in Leuian, "He asked me if I would tell Tchori that he was searching for him."

Gwena says in Leuian, "I said I would, and inquired why he wished to speak with Tchori."

Gwena says in Leuian, "He then told me that he had the information Tchori had paid for."

Gwena says in Leuian, "Which raised my brows, I can assure you."

Tchori asks in Leuian, "how long ago was this.. that it happend?"

Gwena ponders.

Draejlen raises his hand.

Gwena says to Tchori in Leuian, "I cannot be sure.  Perhaps a month, as the elves count the days.  Perhaps a bit longer."

Tchori frowns.

Tchori nods.

Gwena asks in Leuian, "I asked the elf, are you sure it is Tchori you are looking for?  I cannot imagine he would deal with such as you."

Gwena says in Leuian, "In fact, Kandil was with me."

Draejlen stretches.

Tchori says in Leuian, "my .. ahh.. views on serpents is well known"

Tiruna nods up and down.

Draejlen asks in Leuian, "May I?-"

Hott grins.

Tiruna says in Leuian, "usually they don't get yer voice talking to them"

Tiruna paces.

Tiruna says in Leuian, "okay I'm gonna say this again"

Gwena says in Leuian, "The elf informed me that it was, indeed, Tchori he was looking for and he just wanted to give Tchori the information he paid for."


Gwena shrugs once more.

Tiruna sighs.

Tiruna says in Leuian, "drae"

Tchori says in Leuian, "i am sorry.. nothing comes to mind. I will make sure to look for this elf tho"

Draejlen says in Leuian, "I think I arrived in the Spur when something of this matter was being discussed by members of other races at the center of the square"


Reyilion blinks.

Tiruna says in Leuian, "and then after Drae, I'm pulling this back on topic"

Draejlen says in Leuian, "Several San Elves were talking about Tchori and calling him a 'jerk' then he showed up and one of them gave him a message about someone having information for him, that is probably how they set hjim up."

Tiruna nods.

Draejlen says in Leuian, "That was just before I met him.."

Shaleu sighs.

Yinnin nods to Tiruna.

Draejlen says in Leuian, "One of the San Elves threatened that he would let me age a little and then kill me, because he thought I might grow up to be like Tchori"

Tiruna says in Leuian, "you should be so honored"

Draejlen beams at Tchori.


Draejlen says in Leuian, "It would be a great honour."

Reyilion smiles at Hott slightly.

Tiruna says in Leuian, "okay"


Draejlen sighs.

Tiruna says in Leuian, "now my floorr"

Tiruna says in Leuian, "first"

Tiruna says in Leuian, "serpents lie"

Reyilion nods at Hott.

Tiruna says in Leuian, "period"

Shaleu says in Leuian, "sans sow decent"

Hott nods.

Tiruna says in Leuian, "second , serpents like nothing better than to cause dissension and trouble amongst us"

Tiruna says in Leuian, "and to do that they will lie and plot"

Tiruna says in Leuian, "third Our People do not listen to a dang word that comes out of a serpents mouth"


>
Reyilion winks at Shaleu.

Shaleu grins.

Tiruna says in Leuian, "ignore them like a dirty wind blowing around you , or kill them, or snort and walk away"

Tiruna says in Leuian, "but do not believe them"

Tiruna says in Leuian, "now"

Tiruna says in Leuian, "not one of you disagreed with me before when I brought up how we feel about serpents"

Tiruna says in Leuian, "now I ask you"

Draejlen ponders then continues to scribe.

Tiruna says in Leuian, "if a kyn is being tolerent of serpents, what is your responsibility, how do you help your kyn"

Reyilion sighs.

Shaleu says in Leuian, "I agree with you completly and will add this"

Reyilion says in Leuian, "Perhaps I should leave"

Reyilion stands up.

Tiruna says in Leuian, "no dear"

Tiruna nuzzles Reyilion.

Reyilion nuzzles Tiruna.

Tiruna says in Leuian, "you are here, you are kyn"

Shaleu says in Leuian, "it is not always just serpents- the sans also will do the same"

Tiruna says in Leuian, "this might be hard for you to hear, but you are kyn"

Tiruna says in Leuian, "and we love you"

Reyilion says to Tiruna in Leuian, "I've been avoiding this conversation for awhile."

Tiruna says in Leuian, "you are still free to be you at all times"

Reyilion nods.

Reyilion says in Leuian, "I'll stay, it may help me speak with others."

Reyilion says in Leuian, "But I won't comment"

Reyilion sits down.

Tiruna says in Leuian, "but as Khatyra  , I felt this conversation was needed, and I did not bring it up because of anything you have done or said"

Tiruna nods to Reyilion.

Tiruna says in Leuian, "okay who is first, what is your responsibility"

Draejlen glances around.

Yinnin twitches his tail.

Shaleu says in Leuian, "to the well being of my kyn"

Draejlen nods up and down.

Shaleu says in Leuian, "to love, trust and take care of them"

Hott raises his hand.

Shaleu says in Leuian, "to guide and cherish them"

Shaleu smiles.


>
Shaleu says in Leuian, "and to believe their word always over any serpents"

Draejlen asks in Leuian, "I would try to warn any kyn that they may be dealing with a liar and let them know that we are here to help them if anything ill comes of their association with anyone of ...err, lowered ethics?"

Reyilion's stomach growls.

Yinnin's stomach growls.

Tiruna nods to Shaleu.

Tiruna nods to Draejlen.

Shaleu raises an eyebrow.


Shaleu says in Leuian, "actually this past week I had someone come to me about this same matter"



Tiruna listens intently.

Draejlen smiles.

Shaleu says in Leuian, "he told me that osme khits were disenchanted"

Gwena just appeared.

Shaleu says in Leuian, "with us, the Pride"

Gwena grumbles under her breath.

Audun twitches his tail.

Gwena leans on Yinnin.

Yinnin nuzzles Gwena.

Draejlen listens intently to Shaleu.

Gwena murmurs quietly, "Sorry, blacked out."

Shaleu says in Leuian, "he told me that some of these new khits actually saw no reason why they should not talk to serpents"

Shaleu smiles at Gwena.

Draejlen beams at Gwena.

Shaleu says in Leuian, "he then asked me why we would not talk to them"

Tiruna groans.

Shaleu says in Leuian, "for he is concerned about this alliance coming"

Shaleu says in Leuian, "and feels that it would be just fine to gather info from such as the serpents"

Shaleu says in Leuian, "I told him that leuians of honor could never trust the word or information from such"

Gwena smiles at Draejlen.

Tiruna says in Leuian, "never"

Draejlen smiles at Gwena.

Shaleu says in Leuian, "the tarrs especially would use any chance possible to lead us astray"

Shaleu says in Leuian, "I told him of standing in TSC fighting demons"

Shaleu says in Leuian, "and of Ward grabbing the loot as others fought"

Hott says in Leuian, "their object is to spread hate and discontent"

Shaleu says in Leuian, "of grimn finding me alone fighting a demon and joining in with the demon to kill me"

Shaleu says in Leuian, "you would trust their word"

Shaleu says in Leuian, "I will not"

Shaleu says in Leuian, "anyway that is enough"

Shaleu rubs the glimmering white pearl khat'sara band.

Reyilion nuzzles Shaleu gently.

Shaleu smiles atRey.

Draejlen smiles at Shaleu.

Tiruna says in Leuian, "lies and deception, and they hold to that obviously better than some of us hold to Our Culture"

Tiruna says in Leuian, "next"

Tiruna exclaims in Leuian, "what will you do!"

Saberus scratches his chin.

Tiruna listens intently.



Tiruna says in Leuian, "Hott"

Hott stands up.



Hott says in Leuian, "i would warn them that to listen to them is not the path of honor"

Draejlen smiles at Hott.

Hott says in Leuian, "i i could i would have them follow me and explain why"

Hott says in Leuian, "done"

Draejlen nods up and down.

Hott sits down.

Tiruna says in Leuian, "Muther"

Muther says in Leuian, " It is our responsibility to remind them of Their responsibility...and their Honor...Pride is Honor,Life is Honor...Serpents are dishonor...in all they say and do.."

Shaleu rubs the glimmering white pearl khat'sara band.

Draejlen says in Leuian, "Hott has come and rescued me from talking to a Psycian who is a known kyn killer."


Muther says in Leuian, " done"

Shaleu smiles.

Tiruna nods to you.

Tiruna smiles at Draejlen.

Tchori smiles at Draejlen.

Tiruna says in Leuian, "next"

Tiruna glances around.

Tiruna asks Saberus in Leuian, "what say you?"

Draejlen listens intently and continues to scribe seriously.

Saberus ponders the meaning of the universe for a moment.

Saberus says in Leuian, "Having been newly returned to the area, I find it difficult to adjust again to being around such thing, serpants and such."

Tiruna nods.

Saberus says in Leuian, "I say, look, watch and listen, do not hesistate to move away from ill things"

Reyilion nods at Saberus.

Draejlen nods up and down.

Saberus says in Leuian, "Do not be baited and remember in all things Honor First, last and always."

Tiruna nods up and down.

Shaleu nods.

Draejlen bows to Saberus.

Saberus says in Leuian, "Behind that, there is the building and refortifying of our kyn"

Tiruna nods up and down emphatically.




Saberus says in Leuian, "A strong founddation will out last any thing that comes its way short of an earth shaking."

Saberus says in Leuian, "That is what I see and this is what I say."

Tiruna mutters a kyn foundation of pure love and honor might withstand anything.

Tiruna smiles at Saberus.

Tiruna glances around.

Draejlen nods agreement with Tiruna.

Tiruna says to Audun in Leuian, "my love, yer words"

Audun nuzzles Tiruna.

Audun says in Leuian, "Well. My views are rather well known, I would think."

Audun twitches his tail.

 
Tiruna chuckles.

Gwena ponders.

Gwena murmurs quietly to Yinnin.

Tiruna says in Leuian, "perhaps not to everyone dear"

Yinnin blinks at Gwena.

Reyilion raises an eyebrow.

Reyilion blinks.

Shaleu chuckles.

Audun says in Leuian, "As was already mentioned, I feel 'tis never wrong to kill serpents, but I generally liken it to stomping fire ants. There's little sense in doing it 'less ye must."

Gwena nods.

Draejlen purrs.

Yinnin is now following Gwena.

Gwena grunts.

Yinnin has left Gwena's group.

Gwena is now following Yinnin.

Yinnin mutters something beneath his breath.

Audun says in Leuian, "In general, I find the city to our north to be a corrupting influence on kyn."

Audun twitches his tail.

Yinnin says in Leuian, "Gwena and I must take our leave."

Tiruna says in Leuian, "after this part is done, I wish to discuss HOW you talk to kyn about this"

Yinnin bows.

Audun says in Leuian, "Many have tried - and still try - to live there, to reform the place, to help people there."


Draejlen bows to Yinnin.


Tchori bows to Yinnin.

Hott says in Leuian, "be well"

Tiruna nuzzles Gwena.

Yinnin swishes his tail.

Tiruna nuzzles Yinnin.

Gwena smiles.


Yinnin's group just went through an open leather door.

Reyilion says to Audun in Leuian, "And look at me, I was born there"

Reyilion smiles faintly.

Tiruna nuzzles Reyilion.

Reyilion purrs softly.

Audun says in Leuian, "Quite often, I find they're subtly influenced by the values there... 'tis hard to be there without dealing with the locals, as ye know."

Audun says in Leuian, "I don't mean to criticize anyone in particular with my words, of course."

Reyilion chuckles.

Draejlen mutters"we need to build a community where our values shine so brilliantly no one would doubt them."

Reyilion nods at Tiruna.

Audun says in Leuian, "Kyn have gone so far as to try reforming the place by taking part in the government in various ways."

Tchori smiles at Draejlen.

Draejlen blushes.

Audun says in Leuian, "While I can't fault anyone for seeking to make the place better... I personally feel 'tis not our place to make, or even encourage, the lakar of the world to follow the Leuian path."

Shaleu says in Leuian, "each and everyone has left discouraged haven't they"

Audun nods to Shaleu.

Shaleu mutters even my Dugors.


Saberus nods to Audun.

Tiruna nuzzles Shaleu.

Shaleu nods.

Hott says in Leuian, "hard to clean a cess pool"

Shaleu says in Leuian, "you only get dirty"

Hott nods.

Audun says in Leuian, "Many prominent and honorable Leuians have served in such matter. I don't wish to criticize any of them, I just find it an unfruitful path. Better to focus on kyn."

Audun says in Leuian, "'Course we are all free."

Hott says in Leuian, "it rubs of on ye"

Audun nods in agreement.

Tchori's stomach growls.

Tiruna says in Leuian, "Audun said an important thing, lakars, tho they might be friend, are not leuian and never can follow our path, we follow ur path"




A large cloud of dust begins to rise for the Northwest of Spur!





Reyilion raises an eyebrow.

Reyilion stands up.

Reyilion coughs.

Shaleu frowns.

Tiruna says to Reyilion in Leuian, "this be more important right now I thinks"

Draejlen shudders.

Hott asks in Leuian, "whos army?"

Reyilion flinches.

>
Reyilion says to Tiruna in Leuian, "Aye, I'm getting voices though"

Reyilion sits down.

Audun says in Leuian, "I gather 'tis about all I have to say on that, 'less any of ye wish to continue on the topic."

Tiruna says in Leuian, "if you can"

>
Tiruna says in Leuian, "I am prolly more tired than the rest of you"

Audun nods.

Shaleu nods.

Draejlen beams at Tiruna.

Shaleu glances at Tchori.

Tiruna says in Leuian, "and I know this gathering has gone on longer than our usualy 30 to 45 minutes"

Tchori smiles at Shaleu.

Audun says in Leuian, "In general, our people care little 'bout what the lakar do or think. We don't wish them ill, but their concerns are not ours, and our concerns are not theirs."

Tiruna says in Leuian, "but I hold this important"

Tchori says in Leuian, "ill know when or if we are needed"

Shaleu raises an eyebrow at Tiruna in wonder.

Tchori winks at Shaleu.

Tiruna says in Leuian, "and I ask you to stay if you an"

Tiruna says in Leuian, "can"

Saberus asks Tiruna in Leuian, "What that short nowdays?"

Tiruna nods to Saberus.

Tchori's head suddenly begins glowing. He places a hand upon his chest. The glow travels down an arm to his hand. The glow quickly spreads over Tchori's entire body, then fades away.


Tiruna says to Tchori in Leuian, "yer words"

Tiruna says in Leuian, "on this"

Tchori's head suddenly begins glowing. He touches Reyilion briefly. The glow travels down an arm to his hand. The glow quickly spreads over Reyilion's entire body, then fades away.


Reyilion smiles faintly.

Reyilion says in Leuian, "Thanks"

Tchori says in Leuian, "my own views.. are a bit more jaded"

Draejlen beams.

Reyilion smiles faintly.

Saberus says to Tiruna in Leuian, "I kind of missing knowing that at least 4 elven hours a week woudl be spent with kyn, hehe."

Tiruna says in Leuian, "they be yers"

Saberus ducks away playfully.

Tchori says in Leuian, "tho is easier for me.. i am heathen"

Tiruna tickles Saberus.

Saberus laughs.

Shaleu grins.

Audun chuckles softly.

Tiruna says in Leuian, "yer vies are yours, yet are part of us all"

Hott grins.

Tchori says in Leuian, "i have no temple calling.. or gods in my heart"

Audun says to Saberus in Leuian, "Ye are always welcome to drop by our garden... Tiruna's and my garden, that is."

Shaleu mutters most everyone else is too.

Tiruna says in Leuian, "views I meant"

Saberus asks Audun in Leuian, "Think I can get my plate refilled too?"

Tchori says in Leuian, "so i dont feel the compassion of rinanni.. or the hate of taath when i view tarrs"

Tiruna nods to Tchori.

Audun says to Saberus in Leuian, "Surely ye are jesting."

Audun chuckles softly.

Audun asks Saberus in Leuian, "Haven't been fed by Tiruna lately?"

Tchori says in Leuian, "to me.. any tarr is a lost leuian.. i dont feel i should try to correct them"

Tiruna listens intently to Tchori.

Saberus shakes his head from side to side at Audun sadly.

Draejlen nods agreement with Tchori.

Tchori says in Leuian, "any serpent.. is somthing opposite of what I am.. "

Shaleu nods.

Tchori says in Leuian, "i dont kill lakar thieves on sight.. only when they .. insist on it by taking my attention or coin"

Audun nods.

Audun says in Leuian, "To me, a tarr is not of our people, any more than a gobbie is. If they see the error of their ways, go learn an honorable profession, and renounce the serpent, then they can come to me and I'll speak with them. 'Til then, I have nothing to say to the"

Tiruna asks in Leuian, "and how do you address kyn who are accepting of serpents?"

Tchori says in Leuian, "i even allow Tarrs safety unless they draw my attention.. they, i kill if they speak at me.. because they are flawed .. rabid dogs, and as such.. put down if they are running amok"

Audun says in Leuian, "to them."

Tiruna says in Leuian, "what is your responsibility to those kyn, what will you do"

Saberus just appeared.

Tiruna comforts Saberus.

Saberus grimaces.

Reyilion smiles faintly.

Tchori says in Leuian, "i would speak at slade.. but only because i know it well enough that when i tell him Kyn will come for his temple. i am being honest with him as far as I would to any serpent"

Tiruna nods.

Tchori says in Leuian, "for leuians tho.. real leuians.. i think they deserve all the aid we can get them.. not just advice, thats easy and often, jaded by the teacher"

Tchori says in Leuian, "but at least support so they can find their own way to be leuian"

Hott nods.

Tchori says in Leuian, "not little copies of some other leuians views on how we should be"

Tiruna nods.

Draejlen nods agreement with Tchori.

Shaleu smiles.

Audun says in Leuian, "We are all free. My path need not be yers."

Audun nods respectfully.

Tiruna nods up and down.

Hott raises his hand.

Shaleu says in Leuian, "yes it is hard but we must remember"

Tiruna says in Leuian, "we are free"

Shaleu says in Leuian, "we are free to make our own choices"

Tiruna says in Leuian, "not one of our paths be the same"

Saberus says to Tchori in Leuian, "Do not fault me for trying to sway any from their path, for if they can be lead wrong then they may be lead correctly."

Shaleu says in Leuian, "good to point out errors and reason"

Tchori smiles at Saberus.

Shaleu says in Leuian, "but we can not demand"

Tiruna says in Leuian, "tis all important"

Tchori says in Leuian, "of course.. and you know i respect ye warrior, saberus"

Saberus nods.

Tchori says in Leuian, "yours may be a better path then mine.. and likely is"

Tchori chuckles.

Tchori says in Leuian, "but we each get to choose our own"

Shaleu nods up and down.

Saberus grins at Tchori.

Tchori says in Leuian, "done"

Reyilion smiles faintly.

Saberus says to Tchori in Leuian, "Clever Khat"

Tiruna says in Leuian, "Hott"

Hott stands up.

Audun says in Leuian, "Any of ye who feel the calling to speak with young tarrs in the hopes of leading them to honor, I wish ye well. 'Tis not my calling, is all."

Tchori says in Leuian, "only took a few shunnings and MUCH jail to teach me"

Tchori grins at Saberus.

Shaleu nuzzles Tchori.

Saberus says to Tchori in Leuian, "I wont fall into that trap"

Tiruna hugs Tchori.

Saberus hugs Tchori.

Tchori purrs.

Tchori hugs Tiruna.

Shaleu beams.

Tchori hugs Shaleu.

Tchori hugs Saberus.

Draejlen bows to Tchori.

Hott says in Leuian, "to difference to tchori i have to try and convert one if i think there is  chance to"

Shaleu says in Leuian, "little brother"

Shaleu grins at Tchori.

Tchori smiles at Shaleu.

Tchori bows to Draejlen.

Muther asks in Leuian, " are Tarrs allowed to rejoin the path of honor?"
>
Tiruna nods to Hott.

Reyilion says in Leuian, "I've known a couple"

Reyilion smiles faintly.

Shaleu says in Leuian, "nod"

Tiruna says in Leuian, "if they relinquish their godmark"

Hott says in Leuian, "i hve converted some and its grusome to watch"

Shaleu says in Leuian, "yes but it is hard for them"

Shaleu says in Leuian, "and sometimes there are kyn that will not forget"

Audun says to Muther in Leuian, "'Course they need to take up on honorable profession and renounce the serpent. If the take those steps to show they're serious and not engaging in some serpently deception, I'll gladly speak with them and guide them on the path of honor."

Tiruna nods up and down.

Shaleu says in Leuian, "but I have know one such, Jumble"

Hott nods.

************************************************************************************************************

Shaleu says in Leuian, "and I think the hurt that was done her early never left"

Tiruna nods to Shaleu.

Hott nods.

Tiruna says in Leuian, "okay"

Shaleu says in Leuian, "so their path is really hard and maybe they will carry a chip"

Tiruna glances around.

Hott says in Leuian, "done"

Shaleu nods.

Hott sits down.

Draejlen smiles at Hott.

Saberus nods in agreement.

Tiruna asks in Leuian, "is there anyone here left who wishes to speak on their responsibility to kyn who are being overly tolerant to serpents?"

Tiruna listens intently.

Draejlen glances around.

Tiruna says in Leuian, "okay then"

Draejlen smiles.

Tiruna says in Leuian, "I know we are all tired but I hope we can continue this long meeting"

Tiruna says in Leuian, "next question to you all"

Ariadne reveals herself.

Ariadne, Glowing eyes dimming as she fades into the dark, just went through an open leather door.

Shaleu shrugs.

Tiruna asks in Leuian, "HOW do you speak to your kyn about this?"

Saberus says to Shaleu in Leuian, "You know. I never considered that as I watched her."

Tiruna asks in Leuian, "do you call them names?"

Reyilion furrows his brow.

Tiruna says in Leuian, "do you disrespect them"

Tiruna says in Leuian, "HOW do you do this, cuz let me tell you I have seen and heard words that makes me cringe"

Audun twitches his tail.

Saberus asks in Leuian, "Words?"

Tiruna says in Leuian, "so you tell me, you have the responsibility, so now tell me how you will do it"

Tiruna says in Leuian, "tis kyn you are talking to "

Tiruna says in Leuian, "who will be first"

[The Secluded Garden.]

Plush, green grass covers the ground. A small babbling brook rises suddenly from the ground then runs through the clearing flowing over smooth stones creating a miniature waterfall which then drains back into the earth. A large garden with rows of vegetables is surrounded by a radiant flowerbed bursting in a riot of colors. Claw footed oak benches are sporadically placed around the garden and brook. Large trees, as tall as the surrounding building, create a canopy for the clearing allowing small rays of sun, as well as, tiny portals to view the twinkling stars with a stunning view of Rinanni's Circle of Promise. On each side of the garden, almost hidden by the dense foliage of the trees, are two grand deep mahogany tufted leather doors etched with the Pride's symbol.  A babbling brook, an open leather door, an open leather door, a small granite cenotaph, an open flaming iron food warmer, some baked seeds, some bread pudding, some roasted peanuts, a pickled egg, some boiled bottom-dweller, a bowl of beetleheads, a slimy grub, a glass of rare liquor, and some jerkey are here.

This room is illuminated.
In the room are Draejlen the Leuian (seated), Tiruna the Noble Leuian, Reyilion the Noble Leuian (seated), Shaleu the Noble Leuian (seated), Audun the Noble Leuian (seated), Hott the Noble Leuian (seated), Saberus the Leuian (seated), and Tchori the Leuian (seated).

Reyilion scratches absently at his left shoulder.

Saberus raises his hand.

Draejlen smiles at Saberus.

Tiruna says in Leuian, "saberus"

Shaleu says in Leuian, "I guess first step is to become concerned"

Tiruna listens intently.

Saberus says in Leuian, "I always find it best to take them aside. Speaking in public never goes well. Its always good to ask questions, to find out the "why's" of a situation. If they are in error, time and explanation."

Shaleu nods up and down in agreement.

Saberus says in Leuian, "No one says that it has to occur all in one sitting, but to be able to plant the side that they can themselves watch grow, and note, that I like."

Hott raises his hand.

Saberus says in Leuian, "Seed, not side"

Saberus grins.

Reyilion chuckles.

Tiruna grins.

Saberus grins at Reyilion.

Draejlen smiles at Saberus.

Shaleu rubs the glimmering white pearl khat'sara band.

Draejlen smiles at Tiruna.

Reyilion squints at Saberus.

Tchori smiles at Saberus.

Tchori's stomach growls.

Tchori just removed an Elven waybread from within his open large leather backpack.
You see Tchori take a bite of his Elven waybread.

Tchori belches.

Tiruna listens intently.
You see Tchori take a bite of his Elven waybread.

Tchori belches.

Tchori just placed an Elven waybread within his open large leather backpack.

Saberus says to Reyilion in Leuian, "Actually, if I should ever pass, that can be done, I think it would be very nice."

Reyilion says to Saberus in Leuian, "A tree I hope"

Reyilion grins at Saberus.

Shaleu says in Leuian, "see told you Drae-Waybread"

Shaleu shudders.

Tiruna says in Leuian, "do ye have more, Saberus"
You see Reyilion take a bite of his half-eaten sweet green and yellow melonberries.

Saberus says in Leuian, "I was thinking a rose bush. not to keen to having a tree on my back for eternity"

Saberus shakes his head from side to side at Tiruna.

Draejlen grins.

Reyilion chuckles.

Reyilion nods at Saberus.

Tiruna says in Leuian, "thank you for yer seed in the side"

Tiruna swishes her tail sassily.

[ Night falls. The sun has set. ]

Shaleu laughs.

Tiruna says in Leuian, "who is next"

Saberus laughs.

Shaleu says in Leuian, "I guess"

Shaleu raises her hand timidly.

Tiruna says in Leuian, "sister"

Tiruna nuzzles Shaleu.

Draejlen smiles at Shaleu.

Tiruna says in Leuian, "speak yer heart"

Shaleu says in Leuian, "well just seems it might be best if you see one who has been  speaking, hunting with a serpent"

Shaleu says in Leuian, "that one should get together and find about about them"

Saberus asks in Leuian, "Hunting?"

Tiruna nods.

A dark shadow flows across the surface of the full moon.

Shaleu says in Leuian, "listen to them, ask questions"

Shaleu says in Leuian, "get to know them"

Reyilion fidgets slightly.

Shaleu says in Leuian, "and let them get to know you"

Tiruna comforts Reyilion.

Shaleu says in Leuian, "then you can begin to speak with them and they will listen"

Shaleu says in Leuian, "sometimes it is just ignorance"

Tiruna says to Reyilion in Leuian, "if you must go, we will understand, tho I wish you could stay"

Shaleu says in Leuian, "a bit of rebellion sometimes"

Hott nods.

Plush, green grass covers the ground. A small babbling brook rises suddenly from the ground then runs through the clearing flowing over smooth stones creating a miniature waterfall which then drains back into the earth. A large garden with rows of vegetables is surrounded by a radiant flowerbed bursting in a riot of colors. Claw footed oak benches are sporadically placed around the garden and brook. Large trees, as tall as the surrounding building, create a canopy for the clearing allowing small rays of sun, as well as, tiny portals to view the twinkling stars with a stunning view of Rinanni's Circle of Promise. On each side of the garden, almost hidden by the dense foliage of the trees, are two grand deep mahogany tufted leather doors etched with the Pride's symbol.  A babbling brook, an open leather door, an open leather door, a small granite cenotaph, an open flaming iron food warmer, some baked seeds, some bread pudding, some roasted peanuts, a pickled egg, some boiled bottom-dweller, a bowl of beetleheads, a slimy grub, a glass of rare liquor, and some jerkey are here.

Tiruna says in Leuian, "how will you address them and help them"

Saberus asks in Leuian, "Our kyn?"

Tiruna says in Leuian, "yes , our kyn"

Saberus says in Leuian, "Sometimes it can be fairly easy depending upon the serpant.  Some will show their true colors naturally, then you can point out how that goes against our culture"

Tiruna says in Leuian, "they are talking or hunting with serpents, tolerant, believing whatever"

Shaleu sighs.

Tiruna says in Leuian, "how do you address that with our kyn"

Hott says in Leuian, "i usally whisper so its not public"

Saberus says in Leuian, "But it begins with them knowing what our Culture is all about."

Saberus smiles at Hott.

Shaleu says in Leuian, "you speak to them, I do not know if yelling helps but in the end it is their decision, you can only let them know honor can be tarnished"

Saberus says in Leuian, "If one is uneducated, and unaware of their errors then they see no fault"

Hott says in Leuian, "and start of with that path will lead to life of misery"

Hott nods to Saberus.

Shaleu says in Leuian, "but there comes a time"

Shaleu says in Leuian, "if they will not listen"

Shaleu says in Leuian, "you must just turn away"

Hott nods.

Draejlen says in Leuian, "Tell them not to trust the tarrs, give the tarrs all the rope they need and they will show their true colours."

Saberus asks Hott in Leuian, "Misery? I hear ignorance is bliss and many live such lives. Make them away first."

Tiruna listens intently.

Hott says in Leuian, "then tell them why"

Saberus says in Leuian, "I am a believer of education and knowledge"

Saberus says to Hott in Leuian, "Aye to that."

[The Secluded Garden.]

Plush, green grass covers the ground. A small babbling brook rises suddenly from the ground then runs through the clearing flowing over smooth stones creating a miniature waterfall which then drains back into the earth. A large garden with rows of vegetables is surrounded by a radiant flowerbed bursting in a riot of colors. Claw footed oak benches are sporadically placed around the garden and brook. Large trees, as tall as the surrounding building, create a canopy for the clearing allowing small rays of sun, as well as, tiny portals to view the twinkling stars with a stunning view of Rinanni's Circle of Promise. On each side of the garden, almost hidden by the dense foliage of the trees, are two grand deep mahogany tufted leather doors etched with the Pride's symbol.  A babbling brook, an open leather door, an open leather door, a small granite cenotaph, an open flaming iron food warmer, some baked seeds, some bread pudding, some roasted peanuts, a pickled egg, some boiled bottom-dweller, a bowl of beetleheads, a slimy grub, and a glass of rare liquor are here.

This room is illuminated.
In the room are Rhyne the Noble Leuian (seated), Draejlen the Leuian (seated), Tiruna the Noble Leuian (seated), Shaleu the Noble Leuian (seated), Audun the Noble Leuian (seated), Hott the Noble Leuian (seated), Saberus the Leuian (seated), and Tchori the Leuian (seated).

[The Secluded Garden.]

Plush, green grass covers the ground. A small babbling brook rises suddenly from the ground then runs through the clearing flowing over smooth stones creating a miniature waterfall which then drains back into the earth. A large garden with rows of vegetables is surrounded by a radiant flowerbed bursting in a riot of colors. Claw footed oak benches are sporadically placed around the garden and brook. Large trees, as tall as the surrounding building, create a canopy for the clearing allowing small rays of sun, as well as, tiny portals to view the twinkling stars with a stunning view of Rinanni's Circle of Promise. On each side of the garden, almost hidden by the dense foliage of the trees, are two grand deep mahogany tufted leather doors etched with the Pride's symbol.  A babbling brook, an open leather door, an open leather door, a small granite cenotaph, an open flaming iron food warmer, some roasted peanuts, a pickled egg, some boiled bottom-dweller, a bowl of beetleheads, a slimy grub, and a glass of rare liquor are here.
