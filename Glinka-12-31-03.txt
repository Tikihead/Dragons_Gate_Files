A silver-inlaid Dragon in mid-flight had been etched into the floor. Though tiny, the details of the etching are beautiful, from the small silver scales to the bright green emerald eyes which seem to blink every so often. A second etching, this one of a Secian in flight, has also been beautifully crafted and inlaid with silver in the ceiling, right above the Dragon.  A large bright garnet, a small glistening garnet, and a radiant rainbow crystal prism are here.

The giant fortification wall is divided into two main sections by huge doors.  These doors have been made from silver and look as though they could stand even the most fearsome battering ram.  Guards standing atop the walls eye you closely.  To the north you can see the business district.  An open silver-trimmed black drathain gate is here.

Farm animals graze in the distance. Their vague forms barely visible as they lumber about the tall grass. To the north the flat grassland gives way to the rolling foothills of the Great Divide. The mountains themselves are nothing more than ghostly images fading in and out of view on the horizon.

To the southwest the ghostly outline of a forest can be seen darkening the area around it like a blight upon the land. Grassy plains stretch out to the west. Swarms of tiny insects hover just above the grass, in some places the swarms are so dense they take on the appearance of being a single entity.

The path is flanked by countless tall oaks, swaying peacefully in the wind. They do their best to hide the sky from view, making it hard to tell night from day at times. Littering the area are pieces of broken wagon, bits of human remains and dried splotches of blood. The remnants of a violent fight lie all around you, whomever used to belong to the wagon is no more than vulture food.  A bloody severed foot is here.

Travelers from Rathan to the northwest, and the Trade Route to the south, converge at Spur's west gate. Guards posted on the ground give those seeking to enter the city a cursory once-over. Their lack of interest shows that anyone approaching has already been observed from above for some time. A grate in the ground loosens mud from wagon wheels and hooves before they pass through the gate, helping to keep the streets of Spur fairly clean.  An open giant black iron gate, a giant green oak tree, a small blue pool, a thick oak grate over the pool, and a polished stone marker are here.

The relative safety inside Spur is a comfort to those returning from the fields and mountains. To those leaving, a massive wall of defense around the city lies ahead. Archer towers beside the gate overlook the wall, offering a painful welcome to would-be invaders. Several guards on foot patrol pass and disappear behind a thick, bluesteel banded steelwood door. Wall road stretches to the south, a wide passage between the city wall and several large buildings.  An open iron gate, an open thick stone door, and a street lantern are here.

An open carved rosewood door and a street lantern are here.

The niche in the south wall is devoid of anything save a small pedestal that clearly held something of importance.   Closer inspection reveals scattered fragments of broken stone.  The kneeling stone before the empty niche is gouged with shockingly deep slashes.  Only something horridly powerful could have done that sort of damage.  A secret door, a wrinkled vellum message in a bottle, a small canteen, a two-handed long-spear, a pointed feathered cloth cap, a dark braided leather slaver's whip, a blue and white striped cup, a pair of bright colored mismatched socks, a rusty steel long sword, a tattered silk ribbon, some weathered leather trapper's gloves, an open bear embroidered suede belt pouch, a pair of thigh-high snakeskin boots, a rusty steel long sword, an iron chainmail coif, and a feathered birch spear are here.

A small stream runs noisily under the two bridges spanning the ravine. A number of the brunt oaks still stand about, memorials to the forest this once was. A number of small saplings dot the ground between the black trunks. Between the stream bank and oaks, a small path of four-leaf-clover shaped stones weave a windy path through the forest.  A stone bridge, a wooden bridge, a clump of wildgrass, and a small winding stone path are here.

A fine haze of dust hovers over the remains of the Silver Owl Inn. Through the fallen timbers and memories of lives lost, one can see brilliant green sprouts reaching for sunlight. A tiny songbird perches on an old stick of furniture poking through the rubble, singing sweetly to herald new life and hope. A small winding path of stones placed in the shape of four leaf clovers winds itself through the forest.  A small winding stone pathway and a charred ancient steelwood tree are here.

The path of four leaf clove shaped flagstones leads past a small clean shack and into a well formed tunnel through the thorn bushes to the east and the Caersech to the west. The small shack is set back from the road, its walls built of a whitewashed birch. A sturdy corral, filled with well-fed horses, stands to the left of the shack. A matched pair of dapple grays stand in front of the shack waiting to take their human baggage to their destination. To the left of the door, behind a small paned window, a beautiful Fir Elf female takes coin and in return, with a charming smile, directs those who have paid their fare into the waiting room.  A small shack, a freshly painted sign, a notice of non-refund, and a small winding stone pathway are here.

Contrasting starkly with the ashes of the forest and brush is a freshly constructed set of stairs that wraps itself about the large tree. The intricate woodwork that decorates the steps is of the finest quality, as if in parody to the blackened destruction of the hedges and brambles around the base of the trunk. Bright green leaves of clover have begun springing up through the ashy soil in conjunction with soft moss to lend a durable cushion to this well-traveled spot.  Some steps circling the tree, a freshly painted wooden sign, a healthy green patch of clover, a flowing marble fountain, and some clover shaped stones are here.
