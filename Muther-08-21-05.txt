The chipped bark path widens to encompass a broad square between the peaked roofs of the village homes, the larger storefronts, and several communal buildings that all surround a magnificent fountain crafted from local sandstone. The multi-tiered fountain flows with pure, clean springwater and provides seating around its broad base.  The towering trees surround the village, enclosing the square in a living frame.  To the west is a sturdy building with its door perpetually ajar. A line of Leuian children trots off towards the north, bearing their lessons. The faint ding of nautical bells flows in on the breeze from the northwest.   A flowing gold-flecked sandstone fountain is here.

This area is illuminated.
In the area are Kandil the Leuian, Hott the Noble Leuian, Leanne the Leuian, Shaleu the Leuian, Audun the Noble Leuian, Timble the Noble Leuian, and Lthe the Leuian.

The chipped bark path widens to encompass a broad square between the peaked roofs of the village homes, the larger storefronts, and several communal buildings that all surround a magnificent fountain crafted from local sandstone. The multi-tiered fountain flows with pure, clean springwater and provides seating around its broad base.  The towering trees surround the village, enclosing the square in a living frame.  To the west is a sturdy building with its door perpetually ajar. A line of Leuian children trots off towards the north, bearing their lessons. The faint ding of nautical bells flows in on the breeze from the northwest.   A flowing gold-flecked sandstone fountain is here.

An immense, smoothed river boulder deposited by the river, eons ago, is imbedded in the soft loam of the forest floor and blocks the view of the river to the north. A few giant trees have grown bent around its rounded shape and an innovative homeowner has taken advantage of the resulting shelter. Built carefully among the trees in the lee of the rock, stands a magnificent example of the same peaked wooden beam homes that dot the entire forest. One fledgling tree pokes its head through a well-planned hole in the roof.  A pair of closed magnificent carved steelwood doors, a slippery downhill path, and a stack of rocks are here.

Facing the beautiful forest of giant trees are several stately cottages, unique in the carving and design. The eaves are decorated with animal icons, masterfully carved from huge timbers, and the shake roofs are steep and overhanging. Exquisite craftsmanship prevails in the doorjambs, windowsills, and porch railings; each is a design of intricate carving that tells a story. The dwellings are far from gawdy, but instead simplistic in their communal design. A manicured lawn dotted with errant wildflowers fronts each cottage up to the edge of the river rock path.

An idyllic path leads past the looming giant sentinel trees and forks as it heads into the village. The path is flat, edged with beautiful river rocks, and paved with a layer of fragrant wood chips. Through the tall trunks of the ancient trees the peaked roofs of the village homes rise towards the sky without interrupting the natural flow of the forest.

Far above the forest floor, the looming trees' canopy shades the park's paths. Every few feet a break in the leaves lights a fortunate fern or clover patch that languishes in the gift from the heavens. A giant among oaks, dwarfed by the mighty conifers enjoys such a boon.  Its twisted branches decry the battle to survive beneath the taller competitors. Nestled in the crotches of the oak branches, beautiful orchids thrive and bloom despite the weather, causing many of the villagers to believe that the goddess herself has adopted the oak as one of her protected monuments. The villagers have placed benches made of koy around the oak that complement the park without detracting from its natural beauty.  An ancient gnarled oak tree, some fragrant amber orchids, a beautiful hand-carved koy wood bench, a stack of rocks, and an ivy covered sandstone arch are here.

A grove of young, green-needled pine trees surrounds a small meadow of vibrantly flowering rhododendrons. Hues of bright pink, red, and white create a stunning contrast against the darker grey bark of the pines. Brighter green hemlock trees spread to catch the sunlight, which, in turn, shelter smaller stands of delicious salmonberry bushes, airy leather ferns, and poignantly fragranced sorrels that thrive on the compost of the forest floor. Soft haircap moss covers the river stone-lined path, dew from the mist collecting on it like pollen on bees. The distant wash of rushing water quietly filters through the peaceful air that hangs heavily saturated with moisture.  A stack of rocks is here.

A soothing peace has settled over the forest here at the center of the park, where the mists coalesce and then dance back out again amongst the trees. Many small rivulets of water feed into an indent atop a large collection of boulders. As the water overflows the pool, it spills across the sides of the stone to trickle down the steps of the rock formation. Smaller pools are formed as it cascades over the rock until at last the rivulets are reunited into a single small stream which finds its way home to the larger river. Delicate flowering moss has grown over the stones of this centerpiece of the forest, and a small family of larks takes delight in bathing beneath the tiny waterfalls and mossy pools, even as the melodic chirping of other birds wafts through the tree branches all around.  A stack of rocks and a closed door are here.

[Village.]

The chipped bark path widens to encompass a broad square between the peaked roofs of the village homes, the larger storefronts, and several communal buildings that all surround a magnificent fountain crafted from local sandstone. The multi-tiered fountain flows with pure, clean springwater and provides seating around its broad base.  The towering trees surround the village, enclosing the square in a living frame.  To the west is a sturdy building with its door perpetually ajar. A line of Leuian children trots off towards the north, bearing their lessons. The faint ding of nautical bells flows in on the breeze from the northwest.   A flowing gold-flecked sandstone fountain is here.

This area is illuminated.

The chipped bark path widens to encompass a broad square between the peaked roofs of the village homes, the larger storefronts, and several communal buildings that all surround a magnificent fountain crafted from local sandstone. The multi-tiered fountain flows with pure, clean springwater and provides seating around its broad base.  The towering trees surround the village, enclosing the square in a living frame.  To the west is a sturdy building with its door perpetually ajar. A line of Leuian children trots off towards the north, bearing their lessons. The faint ding of nautical bells flows in on the breeze from the northwest.   A flowing gold-flecked sandstone fountain is here.

This area is illuminated.
You see the 1st tawny furred mountain lynx (wearing a small gold collar).

A tall, plain building occupies the west edge of the square. The door remains open, its wood smoothed by the touch of hands and its kick plate, dented and scuffed.  Several adult Leuians discuss current events in hushed tones as small khits dash around them, playing a game of Alarian tag.    A hand-carved redwood sign is here.
