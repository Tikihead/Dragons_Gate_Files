A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.

A large, woven rush mat at the door welcomes you into a brightly lit shop.  The glossy golden pine floor and strategically placed mirrors on the walls gently reflect the light shed by dozens of different lamps, lanterns, and magikal illuminations.  A short, round, glass display case holds a selection of candles in a variety of hues and scents. Torches and lanterns are affixed to the walls in neatly spaced rows.  At the back of the shop a cheerful male Secian sits on a tall stool behind a mirrored counter.  Behind him float several magikal illumination orbs glowing a rainbow of different colors.   A glowing bright crimson paper lantern on a stick, a glowing Dragon patterned stained glass lantern, a glowing finely woven silver mesh cage of fireflies, and an opaque ruby red glass door are here.

A young human struggles with an armful of packages and two young children in tow. Those in need of goods or supplies head west towards the market, those looking for the news of the day head east towards Town Square.  A street lantern is here.

A large gate separates the Merchant District and Town Square-the hub of Spur's activity. The partially opened gate is currently able to accommodate the simultaneous passage of several locals and visitors, but can be expanded to accept carriages, or sealed to ward against invasion.  Guards stand sentry from atop the wall as well as the ground.  A street lantern is here.

Merchant Walk comes to an abrupt end at a massive moonsilver gate. The towering walls of Spur on either side of the gates force all to pass by the guards who are constantly on the watch for thieves and bandits. Just beyond the gates one can glimpse the bustling Merchant District of Spur.  A gilded oak sign and a street lantern are here.

Several city guardsmen have just finished wrestling to the ground some young tough thieves, who thought to rob one of the returning merchants. To one side a relieved-looking Fir Elf gentleman holds on tightly to his gold-tipped walking stick, as the human boy yells his innocence to any who might listen. His pleas fall on deaf ears as the guards drag him away.  A street lantern is here.

Merchants, some in frilly finery, others dressed in homespun wools, travel back and forth along this street on their way to and from work. They seem to blend together here, if only briefly. Several of the more haughty looking merchants are trailed by overloaded carts pushed along by haggard young apprentices.   A street lantern is here.

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.   A flowing white marble fountain, a marble statue of a Human, a highly polished marble statue of a Dragon, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a rosewood sign, a steaming mug of mushroom brew, and a half-eaten cold cherry tart are here.

Vast estates tower over the huge Spurian wall towards the south. The well-to-do who live in these homes idle away their days, enjoying the luxury of time. Standing next to a very empty lantern pole, a small Flerian child insists in a plaintive wail, that he had nothing to do with the missing lantern. The well-dressed guard that interrogates him keeps pointing at a small sack on the ground and its obvious contents.  An open small burlap sack, a street lantern, and a lantern are here.

The boughs of a large apple tree hang over the well tended avenue. Below the beautiful tree stands a small fountain. Atop the fountain is an intricately carved Secian who appears to be dancing with the water as it splashes around her. Set in the marble base is a small plaque that reads, "For those who have gone before us." Many stand for a moment as they pass this way, giving thanks for the gift of life that is given by both the apple tree and the Secians of long ago. Large piles of dirt and broken stone lay on either side of the street as workmen ready the east and west alleys for expansion.  A street lantern, an open Secian etched moonsilver door, a pair of open silver forged swinging doors, and a sign above the doors are here.

Standing next to the large iron gate that separates the center of town from those of the elite class are several of the Spurian Guard. They are here to assist all who pass with the simple kindness of opening a gate, or the more important task of escorting those in need to the bank or market. A young looking cadet rubs wax into the stones of the city wall, his task is daunting, but one that will teach him discipline.  An open iron gate and a street lantern are here.

The occasional locked gate marks the entrance to some of the more hidden estates of Spurs nobility. From this broad avenue, little can be seen of their splendor. Behind the imposing gate recedes a proud drive, disappearing mysteriously into the trees. If not for the large imposing tower rising above the hedges it would be hard to discern anything was beyond the gate. It is apparent the residents do not wish to be disturbed.

Through the gate lies the city of Spur, the major center of trade and civilization on the plains. The dusty road leading through the gates is well traveled, and walls of the city are in good repair. A small shack sits to the west of the road, during most times of the day a dusty coach can be seen waiting in front, its horses stomping with impatience to be gone. To the right of the door is a small window, its opening covered with metal bars. An old man, missing most of his teeth, waits patiently for the travelers to pay their fare, and then directs them into the waiting area. On the east side of the road a billowing multicolored tent has been erected, the hustle and bustle of merchants and customers can be seen coming and going at all times of the day.  An open iron gate and a rainbow silk tent are here.

Tendrils of ruby climb up the dark stone walls, forming an arch below a large orifice that resembles a gaping mouth with fangs.

Dissolved out of limestone by acidic water, the cave opens into a vast cavern. The walls are constantly wet from flowing water and have resulted in cauliflower formations. An astounding variety of glistening  icicle shaped stalactites and stalagmites have slowly formed by minerals in the water slowly building up. Under one of the largest stalactites, a cave pool has receded in this area leaving large mushroom shaped bell canopies.

Blowing wind carrying abrasive particles has eroded the walls in this tall, canyon-like passage. A colony of small cave dwelling bats roost in dense clusters upon the ceiling. A single bat breaks free from the group darting back and forth. Eventually, the rest tumble into the sky tumultuously bounding all around. The group becomes a swirling tornado of beating wings as the bats engulf the cavern. Suddenly, the outburst starts to disintegrate as groups of bats break off to roosts again.

Remains of cobwebs, torn by the breeze, hang limply from the ceiling. Brushing by the cobwebs they turn to dust at touch. Indentations along the walls hold several rotting cocoons. The tunnel slopes in a deep, dark spiral into the bowels of the earth.

The floor levels out slightly from the sharp angle as the tunnel opens out into a wide cavern. Resting in the center of the chiseled room is a large bubbling fountain. The lip of the large fountain glows with strange writhing runes. Under the surface of the water several undines can be seen swimming.  A large bubbling fountain is here.

Upon the walls are emblazoned a strange series of intricate carvings. Long careful examination of the carvings depicts a story of a city of elves. The elves, dominating the storyline, are tall and frail with rather pale skin. Bubbling sounds of water originate from the north.

Pieces of black coal rest against the side of the tunnel wall. A few old carving tools, rusted and broken, are partially buried alongside the coal. A few charcoal outlines follow the curve of the tunnel towards the northeast. Whoever designed this mural had a definite thought in mind.

Damp ground feeds the glistening black mold that is crawling up the walls of the cavern. It is as if it has a life of its own, carefully crawling up the cave surface, taking over anything in its path. The spider like tentacles of mold reach to the ceiling meeting together in an eerie handshake.

Two inches of water cover the ground. Bubbles rise from a fissure in the floor.  It is difficult to determine if it is ground water seeping in, or perhaps an underground stream that flows beneath the cave. A slight smell of sulfur can be smelled as each bubble bursts.

Growing at an odd angle, and sticking out from about eight inches of water, is a colorless plant. The only thing to identify it as plant life are a couple anemic looking leaves. It is as if anything in this deep dark cavern has the life sucked out of it. Even something as strong as this little plant shows the ravages of time and the strength it takes to survive.

Deep enough that a Thugian would have to wade carefully, the water in this portion of the tunnel laps high on the walls. Drips can be heard, and occasionally pelt those traversing the tunnel on the head, or down the back of their necks. Odd looking fish dart in and out amongst unidentifiable items beneath the surface. It may be best to not try to hard to figure out what the items are.

Almost completely underwater the depths of this tunnel have been reached. Darting amongst those brave enough to swim through are small iridescent blue fish, their bodies pulse with an eerie blue light. In the dark of the cave, the light they produce is enough to allow most to see their surroundings. Veins of silver line the ceiling, those competent enough to not drown are able to reach out and touch them if they so wish.

Lapping at the muddy sides, water rises half way up the tunnel walls. Cold water mixes with stringy moss, and objects that remain unidentifiable. Small fish can be seen darting through the water, their skin glowing a light blue. Whether they glow from some unseen ambient light, or just a natural mutation of nature is unknown. Only those lucky enough to fly above the water remain dry.

The sound of dripping water echoes through the darkened tunnel. The smell of moisture and the feeling of dampness invades the surrounding area. Small clumps of florescent moss glow mysteriously on the walls and ceiling. Several inches of water have collected on the floor sending ripples deeper into the lower recesses of the tunnel as people trudge through it.

Minute streams of water seep through slender fractures in the limestone walls. From the constant trickle of water, feathery designs, like lavish drapes, are worn into the light gray surroundings.

The walls in this part of the cave are slick with a thin layer of slime. Faint sounds of dripping water echo all around. A bit overhead, a small point of light struggles to find a way into the cave.

A mysterious glow can be seen to the north. The smell of burning wood permeates the immediate area. Tucked against the wall of tunnel are the remnants of a rather large camp fire. Every so often a small drop of water leaches out from the rocks above and drips on the old ash, wafting the smell of campfire through the cavern.  A dusty camp fire is here.

This portion of the passage way opens up to a large circular room. The stunning aspect of the room is the three-hundred sixty degree mural drawn on the smooth walls.  The rock ceiling is painted a vibrant hue of blue, the floor a lush verdant green. The scene on the walls depicts a large open area, with dirt roads leading off in eight different directions. A careful look at the mural reveals you are standing in a faux Town square of Spur, only in the city on the wall there is not a building to be seen. The fact this must have been drawn a long time ago becomes readily apparent.

The smooth stone walls of the tunnel curve gracefully overhead, barren of any markings or designs. Nothing gives any clue as to who built the tunnel or why. Inky darkness swallows the tunnel in either direction, making it impossible to divine a clue as to where it ends. A small bumpy protrusion of stone awaits for something to snag, its many years alone leaving it bare.  A jagged rock is here.

A gradual rise in the tunnel changes the appearance of the walls. The mix of dirt and stone gives way to soft dirt. A few pieces of old wood, that resemble tree trunks more then wooded slats, attempt to hold back soft walls.

Steps have been dug into the soft earthen floor of this dark cave. Either descending into the darkness or rising to the top of the tunnel, someone long ago decided the going was too difficult and attempted to make it simpler.

A steep sloping tunnel heads south into the depths of darkness. A small slice of light seeps through a crevasse at the top of this cavern. Shrill screams and deep moans resonate from the fissure, echoing off the empty walls. While this tunnel appears to have been here many years, the fact those trying to escape from the jail missed it by such a slim margin is just bad luck.  A long thin crack is here.

Majestic elms continue to line this broad roadway, sheltering the avenue on both sides and further enhancing the grandiose atmosphere.

Numerous trees lining the avenue serve as the dividing border between the majestic estates of the nobility and the lightly traveled roadway.

The avenue comes to a fork, with Noble Way curving from south to the northwest.

Leaving the exceptionally wealthy estates of the Spurian nobility, Noble Way heads toward the Town Square to the northwest.

The homes display a slightly different style, perhaps they are not quite so restrained; a touch more exuberance and freedom with materials is displayed.  A street lantern is here.

Noble Way continues to wind its way among the rather modestly sized, but elegant, homes of the Spur's successful. Many a peasant farmer may live in homes larger than these, but none can match the quality found here. A peaceful, luxurious feeling pervades this part of town; perhaps it is the drifting floral scents wafting from the well-tended gardens.

Set in the marble base is a small plaque that reads, "For those who have gone before us." Many stand for a moment as they pass this way, giving thanks for the gift of life that is given by both the apple tree and the Secians of long ago. Large piles of dirt and broken stone lay on either side of the street as workmen ready the east and west alleys for expansion.  A street lantern, an open Secian etched moonsilver door, a pair of open silver forged swinging doors, and a sign above the doors are here.

Vast estates tower over the huge Spurian wall towards the south. The well-to-do who live in these homes idle away their days, enjoying the luxury of time. Standing next to a very empty lantern pole, a small Flerian child insists in a plaintive wail, that he had nothing to do with the missing lantern. The well-dressed guard that interrogates him keeps pointing at a small sack on the ground and its obvious contents.  An open small burlap sack, a street lantern, and a lantern are here.

The outward appearance of the people here seems a bit classier. Rich clothing and large coin purses are prevalent amongst the travelers. In fact, many of the folk heading into Town Square from the south are accompanied by large bodyguards to assure their safety. The well maintained road is lined with small brass lanterns, each swinging off an individual pole. No expense has been spared to keep those who travel this road safe from the hoodlums that relish the darkness.  A street lantern and a bloody thief arm are here.

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.   A flowing white marble fountain, a marble statue of a Human, a highly polished marble statue of a Dragon, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a rosewood sign, a steaming mug of mushroom brew, and a half-eaten cold cherry tart are here.

Many people crowd the narrow Bazaar Path, either heading towards the infamous Bazaar, or forcing their way back towards Trade Way. For a small price, a farmer can rent a booth and directly market his goods. Both some of the best and some of the worst deals can be made within this collection of stalls. The tall wall of Spur looms high to the east, and many of the guards take an early peek into the carts and the goods coming to market.  A street lantern is here.

Further passage along Bazaar Path is blocked occasionally by brawling peasants. Fights break out over who got here first, who gets to sell first, whose goods are better and who should just pack up and leave. When guards are forced to leave their posts to settle the arguments, all involved lose.  A street lantern is here.

The muffled noises you hear drifting in from the west come out of the Bazaar itself, a veritable hive of activity day and night. An occasional exotic smell is carried by the breeze to tantalize the nose. A large etched window displays tastefully dressed mannequins of many races.  A closed sturdy mahogany door and a street lantern are here.

The going slows down briefly as someone stops dead in their tracks. Every so often one feels the need to take in the sounds and smells that are uniquely the Bazaar. Any slow down in the movement of the crowd creates a loud string of curses. The sellers are eager to get to market to get rid of their goods, and the buyers anticipate their purchases.  A street lantern is here.

A break in the traffic shows a small worn path that heads to the west. Many travel that way, sure of their ability to navigate the stalls and tents that create this market place. The larger carts and those not too sure of themselves continue to head north. A small shack sits on the eastern side of the road, its door hanging precariously on its hinges.  A street lantern is here.

Bazaar Path makes a sudden left hand turn, following the direction of the large Spurian Wall. Carts and wagons creak in protest as their heavy loads shift precariously.

Several large carts head west, full of various items the owners are sure will sell for a decent profit. Empty carts, the sign of a prosperous day, head east. An old Thugian pulls and pushes a very stubborn donkey. Neither end seems to be cooperating with his demands. Two small children dance around the Thugian and the donkey, chanting and singing a nasty song. Quickly, he takes out a switch, which is enough encouragement for both the donkey to move and the children to run.  A street lantern is here.

[Locksmith.]

A heavy odor of unwashed sweaty bodies assails you as you enter this rickety establishment. A short Go-blin-al scurries around in the shadows behind the counter. A variety of keys hang behind his counter, establishing this as a locksmith shop. He mumbles, as if to himself, "Heehee ... chests! Lots chests ... yeeees ... picky picky picky! Hee hee! Me unlock 'em, yeeees ... hee hee!"  A half-eaten piece of creamy chocolate frosted cake is here.

[The Bazaar.]

A new stall has been hastily constructed on this site, in the shadow of the large Spurian Wall. Most chose to build well within the Bazaar as opposed to this outer path. Low-grade wood and bent nails make up this sorry excuse for a business establishment. A small sign on the front has a crude picture of a key on it, and the name, "Skugz."  A crooked wooden sign, a weathered dark wooden stall, and a broken street lantern are here.

[Bazaar Path.]

Two large Oog-ra guards refuse to allow anyone to continue south. With loud gestures and over exaggerated pointing, they send wagons to the east or back north. With some slapping of backs, and happy grins, they congratulate themselves on following directions. A yell is heard from the south as Skugz screams, "Keep meee dooor clear...yes yeees...keep it clear." It is a wonder that he hasn't figured out they are turning away his customers.  A street lantern is here.

A slinky dressed female San Elf preens and giggles garnering the attention of several humans leaning out the window of the guards' quarters. Catcalls and whistles abound as she shows more thigh then is warranted. A wagon driver, distracted by the view, almost drives into a cart coming the opposite direction. Shouts are exchanged and fists shaken, as the San female snickers at all those involved.  A street lantern is here.

The foul odor of something that can be almost described as rotted corpses floats in from the east. You hear the cart drivers murmuring something about not eating the pressed cabbage, regardless of how good it tastes. They quickly point to the long line and the overflowing outhouse and wave their hands in front of their faces.  A street lantern is here.

[Bazaar Path.]

Bazaar Path follows the line of the Spurian Wall. High above you can hear orders being barked and guards marching in rhythm. The closeness of the wall to the path has essentially blocked any breeze that might waft through the area. The stagnant air holds in the smells of food, incense and lots of bodies. It is not unusual to see the cart drivers with triangles of cloth pulled up over their nose and mouths.  A street lantern is here.

Several large carts head west, full of various items the owners are sure will sell for a decent profit. Empty carts, the sign of a prosperous day, head east. An old Thugian pulls and pushes a very stubborn donkey. Neither end seems to be cooperating with his demands. Two small children dance around the Thugian and the donkey, chanting and singing a nasty song. Quickly, he takes out a switch, which is enough encouragement for both the donkey to move and the children to run.  A street lantern is here.

The foot traffic on Bazaar Path turns south down a small trail into the heart of the Bazaar. Many of the smaller carts follow the buyers and merchants to avoid the conflicts with the larger wagons that continue west. The shouting up ahead quickens the pulse of even the most experienced seller.  A street lantern is here.

Deep, muddy ruts mar the road. A trickle of water flows from an unknown source creating a horrid hazard. Drivers curse one another for holding up the flow of traffic.

Bazaar Path makes a sudden left hand turn, following the direction of the large Spurian Wall. Carts and wagons creak in protest as their heavy loads shift precariously.

A break in the traffic shows a small worn path that heads to the west. Many travel that way, sure of their ability to navigate the stalls and tents that create this market place. The larger carts and those not too sure of themselves continue to head north. A small shack sits on the eastern side of the road, its door hanging precariously on its hinges.

The going slows down briefly as someone stops dead in their tracks. Every so often one feels the need to take in the sounds and smells that are uniquely the Bazaar. Any slow down in the movement of the crowd creates a loud string of curses. The sellers are eager to get to market to get rid of their goods, and the buyers anticipate their purchases.

Further passage along Bazaar Path is blocked occasionally by brawling peasants. Fights break out over who got here first, who gets to sell first, whose goods are better and who should just pack up and leave. When guards are forced to leave their posts to settle the arguments, all involved lose.  A street lantern is here.

Many people crowd the narrow Bazaar Path, either heading towards the infamous Bazaar, or forcing their way back towards Trade Way. For a small price, a farmer can rent a booth and directly market his goods. Both some of the best and some of the worst deals can be made within this collection of stalls. The tall wall of Spur looms high to the east, and many of the guards take an early peek into the carts and the goods coming to market.  A street lantern is here.

This well-worn road separates the Bazaar to the north and Market Circle to the south. Only a Thugian could appreciate the layered odors of simmering foodstuffs and shoppers from the Bazaar. Crowds of people push past, some brushing against you. It might be a good idea to keep an eye on your coinpurse.  A street lantern is here.

[Trade & Market.]

The buildings of Market Circle stand to the south. It becomes obvious that the area through the arch is a much cleaner marketplace than the bazaar. An inviting eatery stands beside the road, its door open to those weary after a long trip to Spur, as well as those preparing to venture to the great expanses beyond the west gate. A human couple exit the building, arm in arm. A small sign stands beside the intersection.  A sign, an open glossy lacquered oak door, and a street lantern are here.

After much frustration, the Hithual relents, and sells the giant his new "basher."  An open russet oak door is here.

[Side Street.]

A new building has been erected on this side street. It is sturdily constructed from wood and brick, and bears a sign reading, "Symher's Trading Post." Various objects line the window display ranging from weapons and armor to random objects you've never seen before. Insistent bartering goes on at all hours.  A pair of open double applewood doors and a street lantern are here.

[Market Street.]

Situated between the well-traveled Trade Way to the north and the fine shops of Market Circle to the south, this small stretch of road is busy at all times of day. Adventurers with sacks of plundered goods leave Market Street and head west where a shrewd businessman has set up shop in this busy area of the Market District. A small shop stands slightly to the east of the arch leading into Merchant Circle, light shining through its red glass door and illuminating the store front in a cheerful, ruby glow.  A street lantern, an opaque ruby red glass door, and a gold lettered wooden sign are here.

[Market Circle.]

An arch between two large buildings connects Market Circle and Market Street. The more reputable shopkeepers do business within the circle, but pay higher taxes for the privilege. The buildings have been built to last, as these merchants are no traveling tinkers. Interlocking stone walkways and colorful plantings span this central area. Despite the number of animals waiting outside the bank for their owners, the area is spotless. Loud chatter in many languages can be heard from the southwest.  A marble archway, an open elegant gold-trimmed walnut door, and a wooden sign are here.

[Trade & Market.]

The buildings of Market Circle stand to the south. It becomes obvious that the area through the arch is a much cleaner marketplace than the bazaar. An inviting eatery stands beside the road, its door open to those weary after a long trip to Spur, as well as those preparing to venture to the great expanses beyond the west gate. A human couple exit the building, arm in arm. A small sign stands beside the intersection.  A sign, an open glossy lacquered oak door, and a street lantern are here.

The throngs of travelers thicken as one heads east along Trade Way. An Anthian plays softly on a strange looking stringed instrument, her melodic voice filling the air. Judging by her clothing, and the number of silvers at her feet, she makes a fine living practicing her craft.  A street lantern is here.

The wafting smell of flowers and trees float out from a well kept grey fence.  Old piles of rubble have been cleaned up and the glimpse of a sprawling park can be seen, having been planted in their stead. Beautiful and statuesque monuments dot the landscape through the gate, that remains locked, but has been festively decorated with a bright ribbon.

The relative safety inside Spur is a comfort to those returning from the fields and mountains. To those leaving, a massive wall of defense around the city lies ahead. Archer towers beside the gate overlook the wall, offering a painful welcome to would-be invaders. Several guards on foot patrol pass and disappear behind a thick, bluesteel banded steelwood door. Wall road stretches to the south, a wide passage between the city wall and several large buildings.  An open iron gate, an open thick stone door, and a street lantern are here.

Travelers from Rathan to the northwest, and the Trade Route to the south, converge at Spur's west gate. Guards posted on the ground give those seeking to enter the city a cursory once-over. Their lack of interest shows that anyone approaching has already been observed from above for some time. A grate in the ground loosens mud from wagon wheels and hooves before they pass through the gate, helping to keep the streets of Spur fairly clean.  An open giant black iron gate, a giant green oak tree, a small blue pool, a thick oak grate over the pool, and a polished stone marker are here.

Tiny dots of amber light flicker in the air and vanish as quickly as they appeared. Rough paths lead toward the newly constructed luminescent grey stone structures of the shrine.  A coral altar, a misty grey pedestal of fog, a light golden oak tree, a light golden oak tree, a fog covered dirt path, and a gold flecked coral tiger statue are here.

Mysterious spiraling runes are etched upon the grey walls, which have an ethereal pearlescent quality about them. A simply clad cleric kneels upon a cushioned pad as he takes the hands of Unknown's clergy men and women in his own before pressing a misty grey tube against the skin of their arm. Billowy wisps of mist drift from the followers' arms and disappears into the air after a moment.  A simple cushioned pad is here.
