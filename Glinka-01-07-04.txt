The trees are thinner here, as the terrain becomes more rocky.  Boulders lie scattered about, some shattered, from what must have been a long fall from above.  A skeleton lies partially exposed under one of the boulders, obviously a victim of some rockslide.  Perhaps you should take care to avoid the same fate.  A giant corroded granite boulder, a decayed bleached skeleton, a small glass jigger of rotgut x, an open flowery bearskin bag, and an open worn wool bag are here.

Through the gate lies the city of Spur, the major center of trade and civilization on the plains. The dusty road leading through the gates is well traveled, and walls of the city are in good repair. A small shack sits to the west of the road, during most times of the day a dusty coach can be seen waiting in front, its horses stomping with impatience to be gone. To the right of the door is a small window, its opening covered with metal bars. An old man, missing most of his teeth, waits patiently for the travelers to pay their fare, and then directs them into the waiting area. On the east side of the road a billowing multicolored tent has been erected, the hustle and bustle of merchants and customers can be seen coming and going at all times of the day.

A well-guarded gateway separates the city's residential district from the farmlands just beyond. Guards carefully eye all that enter or exit the city, beckoning gruffly to random travelers for a closer inspection. The structure of the guards' barracks is visible above the road to the west. A weathered wooden sign is posted by the gate.  An open stone gate, a wooden sign, an open thick stone door, and a street lantern are here.

[Noble Way.]

The occasional locked gate marks the entrance to some of the more hidden estates of Spurs nobility. From this broad avenue, little can be seen of their splendor. Behind the imposing gate recedes a proud drive, disappearing mysteriously into the trees. If not for the large imposing tower rising above the hedges it would be hard to discern anything was beyond the gate. It is apparent the residents do not wish to be disturbed.  A street lantern, a closed morbius door, and an open black iron gate are here.

Majestic elms continue to line this broad roadway, sheltering the avenue on both sides and further enhancing the grandiose atmosphere. Fronting the beautiful homes, cobbled paths edged with narrow flower beds meander through nearby private gardens. Though they appear wonderful places to spend an afternoon or take a picnic, the glances from those tending the estates makes it clear they are only for the invited.  A street lantern is here.

A small roadway bordered by flowering hedges bisects the wide avenue of Noble Way at a right angle, heading east to west.  A thick, sturdy sign stands just off to the side of a charming path, its large friendly letters intent on luring travelers into the city's premiere roadstay, the Gilded Lion Inn.

Occasional gates and driveways lead back into the well-kept estates of the city's nobility, breaking and adding interest to the defining plane of the walls lining Noble Way.

Numerous trees lining the avenue serve as the dividing border between the majestic estates of the nobility and the lightly traveled roadway.

However, they are no easier to access, still protected by their own guarding walls, some covered with ivy or colorful blooming vines.  A street lantern is here.

Leaving the exceptionally wealthy estates of the Spurian nobility, Noble Way heads toward the Town Square to the northwest.

The homes display a slightly different style, perhaps they are not quite so restrained; a touch more exuberance and freedom with materials is displayed.  A street lantern is here.

Gazing down each of the nearby private drives reveals a glimpse of a luxurious home, each a miniature estate in its own right.

Noble Way continues to wind its way among the rather modestly sized, but elegant, homes of the Spur's successful. Many a peasant farmer may live in homes larger than these, but none can match the quality found here. A peaceful, luxurious feeling pervades this part of town; perhaps it is the drifting floral scents wafting from the well-tended gardens.

Many grand, even ostentatious, homes line this stretch of Noble Way. Most of the residents here were fortunate enough to be born into the right families.

Some of these names could almost be considered famous.  A street lantern is here.

An unusually large home, even for this part of town, lies off to the west. It seems as if one ambitious owner is slowly buying up the lots next to his and adding them to his own. Groundskeepers are at work in the surrounding gardens, trimming and raking, so intent on their work they do not bother to acknowledge the passing traffic on the road.  A street lantern is here.

Standing next to the large iron gate that separates the center of town from those of the elite class are several of the Spurian Guard. They are here to assist all who pass with the simple kindness of opening a gate, or the more important task of escorting those in need to the bank or market. A young looking cadet rubs wax into the stones of the city wall, his task is daunting, but one that will teach him discipline.  An open iron gate and a street lantern are here.

The boughs of a large apple tree hang over the well tended avenue. Below the beautiful tree stands a small fountain. Atop the fountain is an intricately carved Secian who appears to be dancing with the water as it splashes around her. Set in the marble base is a small plaque that reads, "For those who have gone before us." Many stand for a moment as they pass this way, giving thanks for the gift of life that is given by both the apple tree and the Secians of long ago. Large piles of dirt and broken stone lay on either side of the street as workmen ready the east and west alleys for expansion.  A street lantern and a Secian etched moonsilver door are here.

Vast estates tower over the huge Spurian wall towards the south. The well-to-do who live in these homes idle away their days, enjoying the luxury of time. Standing next to a very empty lantern pole, a small Flerian child insists in a plaintive wail, that he had nothing to do with the missing lantern. The well-dressed guard that interrogates him keeps pointing at a small sack on the ground and its obvious contents.  An open small burlap sack and a street lantern are here.

The outward appearance of the people here seems a bit classier. Rich clothing and large coin purses are prevalent amongst the travelers. In fact, many of the folk heading into Town Square from the south are accompanied by large bodyguards to assure their safety. The well maintained road is lined with small brass lanterns, each swinging off an individual pole. No expense has been spared to keep those who travel this road safe from the hoodlums that relish the darkness.  A street lantern is here.

[Town Square Center.]

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.   A flowing white marble fountain, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a cracked marble statue of a Human, a carved marble statue of a Dragon, a rosewood sign, some flaming ruby ashes, a deep fluffy snow drift, and a sinister demon-headed brass doorknocker are here.

Many people crowd the narrow Bazaar Path, either heading towards the infamous Bazaar, or forcing their way back towards Trade Way. For a small price, a farmer can rent a booth and directly market his goods. Both some of the best and some of the worst deals can be made within this collection of stalls. The tall wall of Spur looms high to the east, and many of the guards take an early peek into the carts and the goods coming to market.  A street lantern is here.

[Bazaar Path.]

The going slows down briefly as someone stops dead in their tracks. Every so often one feels the need to take in the sounds and smells that are uniquely the Bazaar. Any slow down in the movement of the crowd creates a loud string of curses. The sellers are eager to get to market to get rid of their goods, and the buyers anticipate their purchases.  A street lantern is here.

A break in the traffic shows a small worn path that heads to the west. Many travel that way, sure of their ability to navigate the stalls and tents that create this market place. The larger carts and those not too sure of themselves continue to head north. A small shack sits on the eastern side of the road, its door hanging precariously on its hinges.  A street lantern is here.

Surrounded by stalls and people, the masses move towards the south. It is virtually impossible to find the small path that got you to this location in the first place. Only those with a working knowledge of the Bazaar can be lucky enough to find their way through it in a timely manner.  A wooden sign and a street lantern are here.

This is the eastern edge of the Bazaar. The various aromas are almost overpowering, the sights unbelievable, and the variety of exotic items unmatched by any place else in the world. The crowd presses in tightly making those who travel here very aware of the fact that taking your eyes off your destination will find you quickly lost.  A red and white applewood sign and a street lantern are here.

[Food Way.]

The heavy odor tickling your nose proclaims this the food section of the Bazaar. Foods native to every species can be found throughout the area. Many of the items are unique delicacies, not found anywhere else. A quick glance at a few of them and you are pretty certain you know why. A semi-permanent structure stands to the north of the path. A sign over the door announces the location as Gwollin's Brews.  An open faded walnut door and a street lantern are here.

At this intersection many stands display their exotic foodstuffs. Hanging from large hooks are various unidentifiable hunks of meat, and vegetables of all shapes and colors. The only thing more prevalent than the merchants and buyers are the bugs, who clamor to find the most pungent item to land on. To the northeast a small tent can barely be seen hiding behind the stalls.  A white silk tent and a street lantern are here.

Guards stand before each stall at this intersection, on what has come to be known as Jeweler's Row. Crowds of customers vie for the finest stones and most beautiful gems. All different manner of merchants hawk their wares as those you should buy. Those who are not careful are just as liable to walk away with a sparkly piece of glass as an expensive diamond.  A bright vellum sign, an open stall, and a street lantern are here.

Standing on the western side of the road is a small stall filled with beakers and assorted philters. Exotic potions of both the mundane and magical variety are being offered for sale. Standing on either side of the stall door are two rather large Thugian guards, the merchant takes no chances with his special concoctions.  A sign, an open stall, and a street lantern are here.

The well-defined Bazaar path heads off to the west. This corner is a mix of the old and the new. On one corner an old stall is barely standing. The roof has caved in, and it quickly becomes apparent that this location has become a local dump. Pieces of wood that look suspiciously like some of the leftovers from other construction sites are piled on top of rotting offal. On the opposite corner a new tent is being erected, its high roof and vivid coloring pleasing to the eye.  An open stall and a street lantern are here.

A long wooden stall is set here between the Bazaar path and the large barracks which house the Spurian guard. Hanging from the front of the rickety wooden roof are furs of every type.

A new stall has been hastily constructed on this site, in the shadow of the large Spurian Wall. Most chose to build well within the Bazaar as opposed to this outer path. Low-grade wood and bent nails make up this sorry excuse for a business establishment. A small sign on the front has a crude picture of a key on it, and the name, "Skugz."  A crooked wooden sign, a weathered dark wooden stall, and a broken street lantern are here.

Two large Oog-ra guards refuse to allow anyone to continue south. With loud gestures and over exaggerated pointing, they send wagons to the east or back north. With some slapping of backs, and happy grins, they congratulate themselves on following directions. A yell is heard from the south as Skugz screams, "Keep meee dooor clear...yes yeees...keep it clear." It is a wonder that he hasn't figured out they are turning away his customers.

A slinky dressed female San Elf preens and giggles garnering the attention of several humans leaning out the window of the guards' quarters.

Shouts are exchanged and fists shaken, as the San female snickers at all those involved.  A street lantern is here.

Bazaar Path follows the line of the Spurian Wall. High above you can hear orders being barked and guards marching in rhythm. The closeness of the wall to the path has essentially blocked any breeze that might waft through the area. The stagnant air holds in the smells of food, incense and lots of bodies. It is not unusual to see the cart drivers with triangles of cloth pulled up over their nose and mouths.  A street lantern is here.

Several large carts head west, full of various items the owners are sure will sell for a decent profit. Empty carts, the sign of a prosperous day, head east. An old Thugian pulls and pushes a very stubborn donkey. Neither end seems to be cooperating with his demands. Two small children dance around the Thugian and the donkey, chanting and singing a nasty song. Quickly, he takes out a switch, which is enough encouragement for both the donkey to move and the children to run.  A street lantern is here.

Many people crowd the narrow Bazaar Path, either heading towards the infamous Bazaar, or forcing their way back towards Trade Way. For a small price, a farmer can rent a booth and directly market his goods. Both some of the best and some of the worst deals can be made within this collection of stalls.

The partially opened gate is currently able to accommodate the simultaneous passage of several locals and visitors, but can be expanded to accept carriages, or sealed to ward against invasion.  Guards stand sentry from atop the wall as well as the ground.  A street lantern is here.

[Merchant Walk.]

Merchant Walk comes to an abrupt end at a massive moonsilver gate. The towering walls of Spur on either side of the gates force all to pass by the guards who are constantly on the watch for thieves and bandits. Just beyond the gates one can glimpse the bustling Merchant District of Spur.  A gilded oak sign and a street lantern are here.

Several city guardsmen have just finished wrestling to the ground some young tough thieves, who thought to rob one of the returning merchants. To one side a relieved-looking Fir Elf gentleman holds on tightly to his gold-tipped walking stick, as the human boy yells his innocence to any who might listen. His pleas fall on deaf ears as the guards drag him away.  A street lantern is here.

Merchants, some in frilly finery, others dressed in homespun wools, travel back and forth along this street on their way to and from work. They seem to blend together here, if only briefly. Several of the more haughty looking merchants are trailed by overloaded carts pushed along by haggard young apprentices.   A street lantern is here.

A neatly kept park fronts this portion of Merchant Walk. Topiary and low shrubberies partition off small sections of the park. Young lovers sit on benches almost hidden from view, gazing at each other with looks of love, oblivious to the continual bustle of passing customers and merchants on their way to do business.  A street lantern is here.

People carrying bundles stream in from the west and rapidly lose themselves in the large crowds moving about in the vast town square.

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.   A flowing white marble fountain, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a cracked marble statue of a Human, a carved marble statue of a Dragon, a rosewood sign, some flaming ruby ashes, a deep fluffy snow drift, and a sinister demon-headed brass doorknocker are here.

[Town Square South.]

The outward appearance of the people here seems a bit classier. Rich clothing and large coin purses are prevalent amongst the travelers. In fact, many of the folk heading into Town Square from the south are accompanied by large bodyguards to assure their safety. The well maintained road is lined with small brass lanterns, each swinging off an individual pole. No expense has been spared to keep those who travel this road safe from the hoodlums that relish the darkness.  A street lantern is here.

Smooth stones make up the street that leads from the center of Spur to the south. Each stone has been carefully fitted for the most comfortable travel by both cart and traveler alike. A well dressed Guard patrols the area in his dress uniform. Captains don't allow for slovenly appearances on this patrol.  A street lantern is here.

Southern Avenue leads between the center of Spur and the homes of the prosperous and wealthy. Several of the Ladies of the city stroll along the avenue chatting about the current events and latest gossip of the Spur. Behind them, harried servants carry their reticules and all those belongings that they cannot be without.  A street lantern is here.

Vast estates tower over the huge Spurian wall towards the south. The well-to-do who live in these homes idle away their days, enjoying the luxury of time. Standing next to a very empty lantern pole, a small Flerian child insists in a plaintive wail, that he had nothing to do with the missing lantern. The well-dressed guard that interrogates him keeps pointing at a small sack on the ground and its obvious contents.  An open small burlap sack and a street lantern are here.

The boughs of a large apple tree hang over the well tended avenue. Below the beautiful tree stands a small fountain. Atop the fountain is an intricately carved Secian who appears to be dancing with the water as it splashes around her. Set in the marble base is a small plaque that reads, "For those who have gone before us." Many stand for a moment as they pass this way, giving thanks for the gift of life that is given by both the apple tree and the Secians of long ago. Large piles of dirt and broken stone lay on either side of the street as workmen ready the east and west alleys for expansion.  A street lantern and a Secian etched moonsilver door are here.

Standing next to the large iron gate that separates the center of town from those of the elite class are several of the Spurian Guard. They are here to assist all who pass with the simple kindness of opening a gate, or the more important task of escorting those in need to the bank or market. A young looking cadet rubs wax into the stones of the city wall, his task is daunting, but one that will teach him discipline.  An open iron gate and a street lantern are here.

An elegant, carved wooden sign hangs above the ornate gateway set into the massive wall that divides Spurs Noble District from the Town Square. You can make out city guardsmen peering down attentively at all that approach from their posts atop the imposing wall. They seem to take a greater interest in this part of town, though there does not seem to be anything threatening enough here to warrant such attention.  A gilded silver plaque and a street lantern are here.

To the north, you can make out an ornately scrolled gateway set in the base of the imposing city wall. The refined roadway of Noble Way stretches out to the south. The cobblestones of the road are smooth and even. The attention to detail shown here is a dramatic change from some of the other parts of the city.  A street lantern is here.

An unusually large home, even for this part of town, lies off to the west. It seems as if one ambitious owner is slowly buying up the lots next to his and adding them to his own. Groundskeepers are at work in the surrounding gardens, trimming and raking, so intent on their work they do not bother to acknowledge the passing traffic on the road.  A street lantern is here.

Many grand, even ostentatious, homes line this stretch of Noble Way. Most of the residents here were fortunate enough to be born into the right families. Few that live in this area have ever actually had to work for a living. Glancing at the nameplates reveals many of the recognizable names of the Spur. Some of these names could almost be considered famous.  A street lantern is here.

Noble Way continues to wind its way among the rather modestly sized, but elegant, homes of the Spur's successful. Many a peasant farmer may live in homes larger than these, but none can match the quality found here. A peaceful, luxurious feeling pervades this part of town; perhaps it is the drifting floral scents wafting from the well-tended gardens.  A closed elegant black iron gate and a street lantern are here.

Gazing down each of the nearby private drives reveals a glimpse of a luxurious home, each a miniature estate in its own right. Short, stout walls and manicured hedges serve to keep out the riffraff and to protect the small, expensive gardens. Every detail has been attended to display the exotic plants, in all their pampered perfection.  A street lantern and a closed rosewood door are here.

Leaving the exceptionally wealthy estates of the Spurian nobility, Noble Way heads toward the Town Square to the northwest. Along the roadside can be seen the in-city homes of successful merchants and other wealthy citizens of the Spur. The homes display a slightly different style, perhaps they are not quite so restrained; a touch more exuberance and freedom with materials is displayed.  A street lantern is here.

The avenue comes to a fork, with Noble Way curving from south to the northwest.

Everything, even the carefully pruned trees and the manicured shrubbery displays a desire for elegant perfection.  A street lantern is here.

The entire avenue is composed of fine cobblestone, each level with its neighbor, providing a smooth ride for passing carriages and horses. The stones were customized by craftsmen, cut to order, rather than simply placed wherever they might fit. A few stately oaks and elms line the sides of the road, shading travelers during the daylight hours.  A street lantern is here.

Numerous trees lining the avenue serve as the dividing border between the majestic estates of the nobility and the lightly traveled roadway. The estates themselves are noticeably closer to the avenue than those to the south. However, they are no easier to access, still protected by their own guarding walls, some covered with ivy or colorful blooming vines.  A street lantern is here.

A small roadway bordered by flowering hedges bisects the wide avenue of Noble Way at a right angle, heading east to west.  A thick, sturdy sign stands just off to the side of a charming path, its large friendly letters intent on luring travelers into the city's premiere roadstay, the Gilded Lion Inn. The entrance is clearly marked and welcoming, extending off to the southeast.  A wooden sign and a street lantern are here.

Majestic elms continue to line this broad roadway, sheltering the avenue on both sides and further enhancing the grandiose atmosphere.

Though they appear wonderful places to spend an afternoon or take a picnic, the glances from those tending the estates makes it clear they are only for the invited.  A street lantern is here.

The occasional locked gate marks the entrance to some of the more hidden estates of Spurs nobility. From this broad avenue, little can be seen of their splendor. Behind the imposing gate recedes a proud drive, disappearing mysteriously into the trees. If not for the large imposing tower rising above the hedges it would be hard to discern anything was beyond the gate. It is apparent the residents do not wish to be disturbed.  A street lantern, a closed morbius door, and an open black iron gate are here.

A well-guarded gateway separates the city's residential district from the farmlands just beyond. Guards carefully eye all that enter or exit the city, beckoning gruffly to random travelers for a closer inspection. The structure of the guards' barracks is visible above the road to the west. A weathered wooden sign is posted by the gate.  An open stone gate, a wooden sign, an open thick stone door, and a street lantern are here.

Through the gate lies the city of Spur, the major center of trade and civilization on the plains. The dusty road leading through the gates is well traveled, and walls of the city are in good repair. A small shack sits to the west of the road, during most times of the day a dusty coach can be seen waiting in front, its horses stomping with impatience to be gone. To the right of the door is a small window, its opening covered with metal bars. An old man, missing most of his teeth, waits patiently for the travelers to pay their fare, and then directs them into the waiting area. On the east side of the road a billowing multicolored tent has been erected, the hustle and bustle of merchants and customers can be seen coming and going at all times of the day.  A rainbow silk tent and an open iron gate are here.

Through the gate lies the city of Spur, the major center of trade and civilization on the plains. The dusty road leading through the gates is well traveled, and walls of the city are in good repair. A small shack sits to the west of the road, during most times of the day a dusty coach can be seen waiting in front, its horses stomping with impatience to be gone. To the right of the door is a small window, its opening covered with metal bars. An old man, missing most of his teeth, waits patiently for the travelers to pay their fare, and then directs them into the waiting area. On the east side of the road a billowing multicolored tent has been erected, the hustle and bustle of merchants and customers can be seen coming and going at all times of the day.

A well-guarded gateway separates the city's residential district from the farmlands just beyond.

The occasional locked gate marks the entrance to some of the more hidden estates of Spurs nobility. From this broad avenue, little can be seen of their splendor. Behind the imposing gate recedes a proud drive, disappearing mysteriously into the trees. If not for the large imposing tower rising above the hedges it would be hard to discern anything was beyond the gate. It is apparent the residents do not wish to be disturbed.  A street lantern, a closed morbius door, and an open black iron gate are here.

Numerous trees lining the avenue serve as the dividing border between the majestic estates of the nobility and the lightly traveled roadway.

Noble Way continues to wind its way among the rather modestly sized, but elegant, homes of the Spur's successful.

An unusually large home, even for this part of town, lies off to the west. It seems as if one ambitious owner is slowly buying up the lots next to his and adding them to his own.

Atop the fountain is an intricately carved Secian who appears to be dancing with the water as it splashes around her. Set in the marble base is a small plaque that reads, "For those who have gone before us." Many stand for a moment as they pass this way, giving thanks for the gift of life that is given by both the apple tree and the Secians of long ago. Large piles of dirt and broken stone lay on either side of the street as workmen ready the east and west alleys for expansion.  A street lantern and a Secian etched moonsilver door are here.

Vast estates tower over the huge Spurian wall towards the south. The well-to-do who live in these homes idle away their days, enjoying the luxury of time. Standing next to a very empty lantern pole, a small Flerian child insists in a plaintive wail, that he had nothing to do with the missing lantern. The well-dressed guard that interrogates him keeps pointing at a small sack on the ground and its obvious contents.  An open small burlap sack and a street lantern are here.

For a small price, a farmer can rent a booth and directly market his goods. Both some of the best and some of the worst deals can be made within this collection of stalls. The tall wall of Spur looms high to the east, and many of the guards take an early peek into the carts and the goods coming to market.  A street lantern is here.

An occasion exotic smell is carried by the breeze to tantalize the nose. A large etched window displays tastefully dressed mannequins of many races.  An open sturdy mahogany door and a street lantern are here.

The going slows down briefly as someone stops dead in their tracks. Every so often one feels the need to take in the sounds and smells that are uniquely the Bazaar. Any slow down in the movement of the crowd creates a loud string of curses. The sellers are eager to get to market to get rid of their goods, and the buyers anticipate their purchases.  A street lantern is here.

A break in the traffic shows a small worn path that heads to the west. Many travel that way, sure of their ability to navigate the stalls and tents that create this market place. The larger carts and those not too sure of themselves continue to head north. A small shack sits on the eastern side of the road, its door hanging precariously on its hinges.  A street lantern is here.

Surrounded by stalls and people, the masses move towards the south. It is virtually impossible to find the small path that got you to this location in the first place. Only those with a working knowledge of the Bazaar can be lucky enough to find their way through it in a timely manner.  A wooden sign and a street lantern are here.

This is the eastern edge of the Bazaar. The various aromas are almost overpowering, the sights unbelievable, and the variety of exotic items unmatched by any place else in the world. The crowd presses in tightly making those who travel here very aware of the fact that taking your eyes off your destination will find you quickly lost.  A red and white applewood sign and a street lantern are here.

[Food Way.]

The heavy odor tickling your nose proclaims this the food section of the Bazaar. Foods native to every species can be found throughout the area. Many of the items are unique delicacies, not found anywhere else. A quick glance at a few of them and you are pretty certain you know why. A semi-permanent structure stands to the north of the path. A sign over the door announces the location as Gwollin's Brews.  An open faded walnut door and a street lantern are here.

At this intersection many stands display their exotic foodstuffs. Hanging from large hooks are various unidentifiable hunks of meat, and vegetables of all shapes and colors. The only thing more prevalent than the merchants and buyers are the bugs, who clamor to find the most pungent item to land on. To the northeast a small tent can barely be seen hiding behind the stalls.  A white silk tent and a street lantern are here.

Moving into the heart of the Bazaar, you encounter a more established shop. The building is sturdier, and built for long term occupancy. The general store has a steady stream of customers, and it serves those young adventurers who are in need of supplies.  A weathered wooden sign, an open faded chestnut door, and a street lantern are here.

Guards stand before each stall at this intersection, on what has come to be known as Jeweler's Row. Crowds of customers vie for the finest stones and most beautiful gems. All different manner of merchants hawk their wares as those you should buy. Those who are not careful are just as liable to walk away with a sparkly piece of glass as an expensive diamond.  A bright vellum sign, an open stall, and a street lantern are here.

Standing on the western side of the road is a small stall filled with beakers and assorted philters. Exotic potions of both the mundane and magical variety are being offered for sale. Standing on either side of the stall door are two rather large Thugian guards, the merchant takes no chances with his special concoctions.  A sign, an open stall, and a street lantern are here.

The well-defined Bazaar path heads off to the west. This corner is a mix of the old and the new. On one corner an old stall is barely standing. The roof has caved in, and it quickly becomes apparent that this location has become a local dump. Pieces of wood that look suspiciously like some of the leftovers from other construction sites are piled on top of rotting offal. On the opposite corner a new tent is being erected, its high roof and vivid coloring pleasing to the eye.  An open stall and a street lantern are here.

A long wooden stall is set here between the Bazaar path and the large barracks which house the Spurian guard. Hanging from the front of the rickety wooden roof are furs of every type.

A new stall has been hastily constructed on this site, in the shadow of the large Spurian Wall. Most chose to build well within the Bazaar as opposed to this outer path. Low-grade wood and bent nails make up this sorry excuse for a business establishment. A small sign on the front has a crude picture of a key on it, and the name, "Skugz."  A crooked wooden sign, a weathered dark wooden stall, and a broken street lantern are here.

Two large Oog-ra guards refuse to allow anyone to continue south. With loud gestures and over exaggerated pointing, they send wagons to the east or back north. With some slapping of backs, and happy grins, they congratulate themselves on following directions. A yell is heard from the south as Skugz screams, "Keep meee dooor clear...yes yeees...keep it clear." It is a wonder that he hasn't figured out they are turning away his customers.

A slinky dressed female San Elf preens and giggles garnering the attention of several humans leaning out the window of the guards' quarters.

Shouts are exchanged and fists shaken, as the San female snickers at all those involved.  A street lantern is here.

It is not unusual to see the cart drivers with triangles of cloth pulled up over their nose and mouths.  A street lantern is here.

Several large carts head west, full of various items the owners are sure will sell for a decent profit. Empty carts, the sign of a prosperous day, head east. An old Thugian pulls and pushes a very stubborn donkey. Neither end seems to be cooperating with his demands. Two small children dance around the Thugian and the donkey, chanting and singing a nasty song. Quickly, he takes out a switch, which is enough encouragement for both the donkey to move and the children to run.  A street lantern is here.

The buildings of Market Circle stand to the south. It becomes obvious that the area through the arch is a much cleaner marketplace than the bazaar. An inviting eatery stands beside the road, its door open to those weary after a long trip to Spur, as well as those preparing to venture to the great expanses beyond the west gate. A human couple exit the building, arm in arm. A small sign stands beside the intersection.  A sign, an open glossy lacquered oak door, and a street lantern are here.

A large gate separates the Merchant District and Town Square-the hub of Spur's activity.

Incredible images cover every free corner of this small store, pictures of every possible rune available for purchase hang from the ceiling, on the walls and some even sit on the floor. Drawn onto scrolls, carved into the wood finish of the building or crafted from any number of other materials, each of the different runes has its own strange feeling of excitement to it. The shop owner looks to know what every one of the runes does.  A large glowing sign, a wooden sign, an intricately carved oak door, and some flaming ruby ashes are here.

A small sign hangs from above the door of the well-kept store before you, telling you that it is a rune shop. The occasional bright flash of light from inside the store suggests all kinds of strange and rare magicks are being cast inside!

A massive circular stone platform stands to the side of Magick Lane, strangely entrancing runes carved on every inch of its sides. The symbol of the god Sa, a golden Dragon, fills the space along the top. Raw power and magick seem to flow from the platform, making the air around it crackle with energy.

Gwen looks like a 1'5" standard young average boned, wirey-tough bodied Secian Cleric.
She has long, wild, fine coppery red hair, with triangular pale red eyes, and looks neat.
She appears to be happy right now.
She bears the mark of Elindale.
She can be attacked by other players.

On her back is a pair of small shimmering, iridescent turquoise wings. Tiny water droplets have beaded along the edges and reflect the light back in a rainbow brilliance.

On her right ankle is a tattoo of a tiny ivory unicorn with a turquoise horn. The unicorn's mane and tail are brilliantly colored with deep shades of blues and greens.

On her stomach, around the belly-button is a tattoo of a ring of mushrooms. The tiny ruby caps are dotted with turquoise spots. Peeking out from behind one is a bluish green wind faerie.

She appears to be in perfect health.

Physical appearance:

A small pixish face is surrounded by waves of bright red hair that flows down her back. Freckles dominate the bridge of her nose and spill onto her cheeks. Soft red eyes glow faintly in the light.

Keeping watch in front of this establishment, a fully assembled set of shining plate armor stands before the door. An inlaid crest on the shield reads "Thick as a Brick."

After much frustration, the Hithual relents, and sells the giant his new "basher."  An open russet oak door is here.

Situated between the well-traveled Trade Way to the north and the fine shops of Market Circle to the south, this small stretch of road is busy at all times of day.

The buildings of Market Circle stand to the south. It becomes obvious that the area through the arch is a much cleaner marketplace than the bazaar. An inviting eatery stands beside the road, its door open to those weary after a long trip to Spur, as well as those preparing to venture to the great expanses beyond the west gate. A human couple exit the building, arm in arm. A small sign stands beside the intersection.  A sign, an open glossy lacquered oak door, and a street lantern are here.

The throngs of travelers thicken as one heads east along Trade Way. An Anthian plays softly on a strange looking stringed instrument, her melodic voice filling the air.

Deep grey mists surround a strange pile of rubble that lies south of the road. Occasionally a priest clad in a simple grey robe will wander past the rubble and whisper a short prayer under his breath. The fence running around the rubble is well kept, but the gate which once allowed entrance to this Temple has been chained closed.  A grey iron chained gate, a pile of rubble, and a street lantern are here.

From the city gate to the west, Trade Way continues eastward towards the busy Merchant district, past Joyeusse's Shop. The air is thick with the scent of fresh flowers.

The relative safety inside Spur is a comfort to those returning from the fields and mountains. To those leaving, a massive wall of defense around the city lies ahead. Archer towers beside the gate overlook the wall, offering a painful welcome to would-be invaders. Several guards on foot patrol pass and disappear behind a thick, bluesteel banded steelwood door. Wall road stretches to the south, a wide passage between the city wall and several large buildings.  An open iron gate, an open thick stone door, and a street lantern are here.

Travelers from Rathan to the northwest, and the Trade Route to the south, converge at Spur's west gate. Guards posted on the ground give those seeking to enter the city a cursory once-over. Their lack of interest shows that anyone approaching has already been observed from above for some time. A grate in the ground loosens mud from wagon wheels and hooves before they pass through the gate, helping to keep the streets of Spur fairly clean.  An open giant black iron gate, a giant green oak tree, a small blue pool, a thick oak grate over the pool, and a polished stone marker are here.

An osprey soars above the raging Silver River, scanning the water for a meal. Suddenly, it dives down to the surface and snatches a rather large trout from the water. The trout wriggles helplessly in the large birds grip as it is carried off on the western horizon.

What once was the intersection of two roads is now a single road paralleled by a massive amount of rock, mud and timber. A new landslide covers the older settled debris making passage to the northeast impossible. Rocks and pebbles lay across the path making movement precarious. The new landslide still groans and shifts ever so slightly.

Old trees lay side by side with the massive boulders of the mountain, intermingling in a terrible landslide. The mountain top has broken off and slid across the eastern road stopping all forms of transportation. It would take years for mortal hands to remove the tons of stone from the original roadway to make it passable once again. Thankfully, nature has changed the landscape for the better, and has opened a gap through the mountain to the north.

The only sound you hear at this point is the soft click of rocks falling down the side of the steep walls. It seems like you could be buried alive under tons of rocks at any moment. Large boulders sit precariously above you, waiting for the slightest vibration to jar them loose.

This newly constructed road begins the climb to the mountain peaks as a vein from the main Rathan-Fort Tarath artery. Following the steep incline of the mountain's side, this twisting path travels its way to the opposite side of the City of Rathan. High above in that part of the mountain, a single silver-spired tower peaks through the misty mountain air and glistens slightly.

The walls of Fort Tarath stand tall between the walls of the gorge almost as if daring an army to try and breech them. Large piles of blackened rubble, the product of the roadway excavation, fill the narrow valley between the road edge and the mountain to the south.

Another massive boulder, black and melted, blocks any further passage toward the top of the mountain. Thick grey and white clouds hang heavily near the edge of the road, swirling ever so slightly in the breeze. There is no way to continue up the mountain except perhaps by climbing the sheer cliff wall. The clouds pulse slightly and gravitate toward the road surface, the sound of thunder rolling over the area.

A ribbon of pure silver stretches out through the billowing clouds toward the peak of the mountain. Each step is like walking on soft carpeting but without any solid underfooting to hold one up.

What appears to be skeletal arm holding a gem encrusted sword is embedded deep within the crystal wall, almost like an insect encased in amber. Other then the fact that the arm belonged to a humanoid there is no distinction between any race known in the world. Whatever stories the previous owner could have told, this part of the body will never be able to reveal them.  A glowing bunch of moss and a bronze scimitar are here.

The strand widens toward the base of the tower, its silver-black surface reflecting the purple light from the walls. The tower is now completely in view, its walls not just glowing purple, but made of some sort of deep purple crystal magickally infused with a glowing light. There is but a single entrance gate and one narrow window slit high above the ground noticeable with a first glance. The silver spire hums slightly giving off a beautiful tune.

Another massive boulder, black and melted, blocks any further passage toward the top of the mountain. Thick grey and white clouds hang heavily near the edge of the road, swirling ever so slightly in the breeze. There is no way to continue up the mountain except perhaps by climbing the sheer cliff wall. The clouds pulse slightly and gravitate toward the road surface, the sound of thunder rolling over the area.

The strand twists and stretches and in some parts is not entirely there. Large holes open and close on its surface but without fail passage over these rifts is made without any problems. Above and surrounding the strand, the billowing clouds make up the walls of a silky tunnel, flickering with light and the sounds of rolling thunder every so often. The tunnel leads east to a solid mountain roadway and west into a blur.

The chamber is completely dark except for a few areas where the walls and ceiling glitter with shining turquoise gems. Deep cracks have been carved sporadically, seemingly by the force of claws. Jagged stalactites hang from the ceiling almost touching the floor in some areas, deadly sharp and freezing to the touch.

Along the very bottom of the seemingly depthless pool smooth turquoise gems have been placed with care for safekeeping, a large star shaped figurine of a breathtaking blue green in the middle in remembrance of many nights of stargazing. A few piles of gems line the corners, carefully stacked next to large chests of treasure. Massive boulders line the water, one stands out in particular perfectly smooth.

Deep turquoise crystal pillars support a domed roof of frosted glass. In the very center of the massive dome is an etching of a silver-eyed turquoise Dragon in mid-flight with a turquoise winged Secian upon her shoulder. A mosaic of tiles depicting a flight of dragons in all their colors spreads out in front of small waterfall that steadily flows into a crystal clear pool. Velvet pillows in a myriad of colors are scattered around allowing for a spot to rest and converse. Tiny candles with enchanted blue flames line the walls on turquoise sconces, filling the room with an eternal warm light.  A breathtaking flowing waterfall, a blue and white swirled crystal candy dish, a smooth turquoise platter, some brightly colored pillows, a large tasseled turquoise velvet pillow, a small silver-trimmed turquoise silk pillow, an intricately inlaid tile mosaic, and a closed giant turquoise trimmed steel drawbridge are here.

[Forsythia's Chamber]

The air is brisk with an icy chill reminding of the coldest winter days, hitting you with full force upon entering this underground room. The chamber is completely dark except for a few areas where the walls and ceiling glitter with shining turquoise gems. Deep cracks have been carved sporadically, seemingly by the force of claws. Jagged stalactites hang from the ceiling almost touching the floor in some areas, deadly sharp and freezing to the touch. In the center of the area is an enormous pool, the waters crystal clear and pure. Along the very bottom of the seemingly depthless pool smooth turquoise gems have been placed with care for safekeeping, a large star shaped figurine of a breathtaking blue green in the middle in remembrance of many nights of stargazing. A few piles of gems line the corners, carefully stacked next to large chests of treasure. Massive boulders line the water, one stands out in particular perfectly smooth.  A breathtaking pile of turquoise gems, an enormous smooth flat rock, a closed turquoise encrusted driftwood sea chest, a closed turquoise banded opal treasure box, and a closed antique stone turquoise handled armor cabinet are here.

[Hot Springs.]

Steam radiates off of the springs surface, making the air inside the room warm and humid. Lush tropical vegetation grows around the edges of the pool, some brilliantly colored lilies sprouting from the water itself. Flowered creeping vines grow up the walls and weave together across the ceiling, perfuming the area with a light, sweet scent. Here and there bits of bluish glowing moss dot the walls, lighting the area softly.  A warm blue green spring, some pure white lilies, some flowered creepers, a giant turquoise streaked ivory clam shell, a weathered sunken treasure chest, and a breathtaking flowing waterfall are here.

The fence begins at this corner and travels to the west, where it has been attached to the solid rock face of the mountain side. One of the weeping willow from within the garden drops its limbs over this side of the fence. Large blooming flowers poke up through the ground near the base of the fence, adding a variety of color to the landscape.

A small lawn of bluegrass extends from the base of the exterior palace wall and butts up against the cobblestone curb. High overhead, one of the four palace spires soars, the purple standard at its peak flapping in the wind. The deep purple face of the palace wall seems to glow slightly, its body radiating pink rays of light onto the road.

A pleasant breeze rustles the hardy pine trees which line this cobblestone street. A large establishment of deep purple crystal dwarfs the other structures, its silver spires reaching high overhead. Just beyond the elegant structure, the Silver Mountain provides a sense of safety. The street widens sharply to the east and west in a delta of smoother stone, either side trailed by a lawn of low-cut green grass. A polished white stairway leads up to a great silver gate, its body set within a massive carved archway which itself is centered within the crystal wall.  An announcement and an ornate silver gate are here.

A beautiful crystal fountain, topped with the statue of King Rathanus the First, resides at the center of the plaza square. Water sprays from the king's open mouth and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular marble tiled pool. The fountain, a tribute to the founding ruler of Rathan, symbolizes Rathanus granting the breath of life to the once barren mountain side. Luminous crystal street lanterns, gilded marble benches, and delicately pruned rose bushes surround the perimeter of the square. Located at the very heart of the city, the plaza serves as a focal point for both business and casual interactions.  A large glistening silver crystal fountain, some silver gilded marble benches, and some blooming silvery bushes of Rathene roses are here.

Old trees lay side by side with the massive boulders of the mountain, intermingling in a terrible landslide. The mountain top has broken off and slid across the eastern road stopping all forms of transportation. It would take years for mortal hands to remove the tons of stone from the original roadway to make it passable once again. Thankfully, nature has changed the landscape for the better, and has opened a gap through the mountain to the north.

Thorny vines reach out across the path making travel difficult. The thicket has become so overgrown that it is nearly impassable in places. The ground is worn by the soles of countless feet, making the dense wall of bramble seem even more out of place.

Travelers from Rathan to the northwest, and the Trade Route to the south, converge at Spur's west gate. Guards posted on the ground give those seeking to enter the city a cursory once-over. Their lack of interest shows that anyone approaching has already been observed from above for some time. A grate in the ground loosens mud from wagon wheels and hooves before they pass through the gate, helping to keep the streets of Spur fairly clean.  An open giant black iron gate, a giant green oak tree, a small blue pool, a thick oak grate over the pool, and a polished stone marker are here.

The relative safety inside Spur is a comfort to those returning from the fields and mountains. To those leaving, a massive wall of defense around the city lies ahead. Archer towers beside the gate overlook the wall, offering a painful welcome to would-be invaders. Several guards on foot patrol pass and disappear behind a thick, bluesteel banded steelwood door.

Deep grey mists surround a strange pile of rubble that lies south of the road. Occasionally a priest clad in a simple grey robe will wander past the rubble and whisper a short prayer under his breath.

An arch between two large buildings connects Market Circle and Market Street. The more reputable shopkeepers do business within the circle, but pay higher taxes for the privilege. The buildings have been built to last, as these merchants are no traveling tinkers. Interlocking stone walkways and colorful plantings span this central area. Despite the number of animals waiting outside the bank for their owners, the area is spotless. Loud chatter in many languages can be heard from the southwest.

Thick plank floors are covered with a beautiful white and gold rug. Set upon the rug is a large overstuffed golden sofa. Threads of what look like pure spun gold run vertically throughout the sofa catching even the tiniest of light and reflecting it out to the walls of the bungalow. Behind a white slatted divider is a large bed, its white downy comforter falling to the floor. Beneath a large picture window that looks over the courtyard is a small wooden table with two chairs, perfect for a meal with a view.

Set among the large pine trees are four small white bungalows. Each with a uniquely colored door. They are set in an "L" shape, two of them north of the road and two of them east, a mirror reflection of the bungalows to the south. In front of each home is a beautiful garden, created to reflect the personality of those who live within. A well manicured courtyard sits in front of the homes dotted with smaller pines and benches. Small rabbits hop along unmolested nibbling upon the lush grass.  A closed blue pine door, a closed tan pine door, a closed red pine door, and a closed white pine door are here.

Thick plank floors are covered with a beautiful white and gold rug. Set upon the rug is a large overstuffed golden sofa. Threads of what look like pure spun gold run vertically throughout the sofa catching even the tiniest of light and reflecting it out to the walls of the bungalow. Behind a white slatted divider is a large bed, its white downy comforter falling to the floor. Beneath a large picture window that looks over the courtyard is a small wooden table with two chairs, perfect for a meal with a view.  A closed white pine door, a large comfortable bed, a closed gold-trimmed white walnut chest, a glowing crystal orb, and a white framed glass window are here.
