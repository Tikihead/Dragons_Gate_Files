A treacherous dusty trail leads west along the shaky fault line from a fork in the main road. The original roadbed has fallen into the chasm years ago, leaving the merchants to their own wiles to ply the slippery slopes past the fault zone. Many attempts have failed at conquering the shifting dirt and rocks. Currently a bumpy trail skirts the bigger rocks and loose gravel.

The old merchant road lies in pieces at the bottom of a deep gorge far below. An artificial pathway has been constructed in the wake of the recent collapse, allowing continued passage through the mountains. This new merchant road has been constructed in great haste and is still quite unstable. Gravel that has been spread on the road to make it safer, is actually making it far more precarious. Pebbles roll continuously off of the roads surface and down into the chasm below.

The road ascends upward at a rather severe angle towards the northwest combined with the shifting road surface, it makes this particular passage very difficult for any merchants traveling with a large quantity of goods. A swiftly flowing river is visible several hundred feet below, and it can only be assumed that it was the cause of the collapse of old merchant road. The audible roar of the river is evident, even this far above.

A lone carrion bird seems to stare from the branches of a gnarled old tree. The road surface alternates between the usual hard-packed dirt covered in gravel, and solid rock. The terrain creates even more difficult travel for those heading north or south. A large pile of broken wagons, barrels, and boxes lie quite some distance below. Many skeletons of pack animals, picked clean by carrion birds, are also discernible. It is highly likely some of the bones are Humanoid as well.

Just to the south is the juncture where old merchant road connected to this new road. Just beyond that is the deep gorge that has swallowed up the old road. The road surface is a stable solid rock, but is barely large enough for a single wagon to pass through. Unlike the new merchant road to the southwest, this road follows a more natural flow up the eastern cliffside carefully traversing the steep mountain. A single yellow wildflower grows defiantly out of the rocky cliff, giving a stark contrast to the solid grey that surrounds it.  A small yellow wildflower is here.

The cliffs to the south fall away just for a brief instant at this point on the trail. Two picturesque snow-capped mountain peaks come together in the distance for a lower pass through their forested bases. The white glint of a distant waterfall glistens amongst the green backdrop. The granite road below you continues its precarious trek eastward up the cliffside.

Despite the fact the cliffs to the north are nearly vertical, various plants still cling to life against them. Many are common weeds or merely grasses, but some are delicate wildflowers, leaving little or no explanation as to their presence on the cliff. One small tree is also attempting to take root along the cliffside, its branches jutting out at odd angles.  An oddly shaped rosewood tree is here.

The cliff face to the north is slightly more sloped than others, allowing far more vegetation to grow on it. Small shapes are visible scurrying about among the grasses and shrubs, most of them reacting to any movement on the road. A few are visible up the road ahead, but quickly vanish at the distant screech of a raptor. It is a few moments before they curiously return.  Some small cute striped chipmunks are here.

The poor construction of this road becomes quickly evident. Water is flowing down over the sides of the cliff above and across the road surface. Due to the slight slope of the road toward the deep chasm to the south, this section of road is quite hazardous. Many broken pieces of rope and metal spikes are strewn all over the pathway; evidently failed attempts to keep wagons from sliding over the side. Large piles of heavy looking stones have now been stacked along the edge of the gorge in hopes it will prevent trade carts from careening off the edge. Several of these stones seem to be missing. Evidently the idea is not working as well as was hoped.  A large pile of stones and a large pile of stones are here.

A large pile of unexplained wooden crates and barrels have been tossed unceremoniously in an alcove off the side of the main road. They have all been scavenged long ago and simply lie abandoned by their owners. For hundreds of feet in either direction, the road surface is covered in deep grooves, making wagon travel quite hazardous. Even at a slow pace the vibrations are intense enough to damage cargo. This is made evident as a heavily laden wagon shudders down the slope. Swearing loudly, the merchant tosses what sounds like a crate full of broken glass into the alcove before continuing onward.  A pile of wooden crates and barrels is here.

A large gap in the roadway is now spanned by a rickety looking wood and rope bridge. The slats seem to be spaced just close enough so that a wagon wheel does not get lodged between them. The remnants of the foundations of an old stone bridge are evident on both sides of this gap. A few hundred feet below the present bridge, the former one is visible in several pieces. Considering the state of the old bridge, this unstable replacement does not exactly inspire feelings of safety.  A decrepit looking wood and rope bridge is here.

Several large cracks split the roads surface at odd angles, threatening to swallow unwary travelers. Large and very unsteady wooden boards have been placed across the gaps, creating makeshift bridges. Many of the boards have a significant curve to them, suggesting that they may have been the victim of a rather large traveler.

A large pile of animal carcasses in various stages of decay is situated on a precarious ledge halfway up the cliff face. Bloody footprints from some sort of predatory animal are plainly visible along the edge of the path, providing a bit of insight into the decaying animal remains. The road reaches the top of the cliff up the gentle slope to the east.  Some greying oak planks are here.

There is an extremely large crevasse in the roadway that would normally prevent any further travel along this road. Astoundingly, someone has constructed a very sturdy looking bridge using two perfectly chiseled granite blocks. The blocks make up the support for the bridge structure, which is also constructed of chiseled granite slabs. There is seemingly no explanation for the excellent condition of this stretch of the road.  A sturdy granite bridge is here.

The cliff face to the north is wet, but there is no apparent source of the moisture. A slight overhang also creates a near permanent shadow in the area, providing a perfect atmosphere for the dense lichen that covers the rocks. Sporadic tufts of grass futilely attempt to assert themselves against the multi-colored lichen, but the spongy fungus prevails. Strange looking spiders scurry about amongst the lichen-covered rocks, before disappearing over the top of the cliff.

Small low-lying bushes with bright red berries dominate this stretch of the road. Many birds of various sizes and colors hop from bush to bush, chirping pleasantly as they feast upon the berries.

A large number of horses, carts, and merchants are congregated off the side of the road. They are either preparing for the journey down the cliff to the southwest, or are resting from the trip in the opposite direction. A dangerously high cliff is visible to the south, while to the east a flat plateau leads the roadway between two large mountains. The green hue of a forest is just visible between them.

The road is almost non-existent. The many large granite boulders that cover the path evidence the instability of the mountains to the north and south. The merchants who travel this road have erected a series of shoddy road signs to direct travelers safely around the boulders. Several of these signs point away from a shadowy area just off the side of the road. The rocks of the area seem to hang over the road slightly, blocking out the light. Light colored stringy material is barely visible along the side of the path.  A flimsy wooden sign, a flimsy wooden sign, and a craggy overhang are here.

The merchant road ascends slightly to the east as it travels between two mountain peaks. Up the slopes to the north and south is a dense forest with massive red barked trees. Closer to the path, the forest begins to thin out and only a few trees have established themselves close to the road. The merchants who made this road did not bother to go around one of the largest, which is situated directly in the middle of the path.  An ancient towering rosewood tree is here.

The tranquil terrain has been torn asunder to the northwest. One of the forces of nature has caused a great fissure to open in the earth. Although the fissure slopes downward at a severe angle, the terrain is surprisingly smooth and could be navigated even by a goods-loaded wagon. To the east a great deal of grass is growing on the road itself. It almost seems as if no one has used that road in a while.

Many tons of earth have shifted from the face of the mountain to the ground, covering the small growth of forest at its base. The southeastern road is totally blocked with rubble.

Rough granite walls rise above you to the east and west. The area here is a bit rougher and seems to have been recently mined. Large veins of silver can be seen. Up overhead, on the western face of the gorge wall a large crack has appeared. Though large enough to fit a Thugian, the only thing exiting the crack is a steady stream of dripping water.

You stand before a granite wall and large double gated doors. The walls are thick and finely crafted, and there seems to be a rather aged look about them.  The Gate is made of massive slabs of silver, while off to the left and right are the fort's impressive walls, able to withstand a rather large invasion or army if need be.

The sturdy wooden walls and support beams surrounding you serve as an extension of the dark stone cavern that descends gradually into the depths of the earth. The smell of dried blood drifts in on a cool breeze from the cavern, only to be replaced by the over powering scent of burning sulfur. The walls of the cavern house several mounted display cases, each one stocked fully with potions featuring a range of effects from restoring life to taking the last breath of an unsuspecting victim. An intricately carved ash bookshelf stretches up toward the ceiling above, housing a large collection of books on anything from Arachnian alchemy techniques to Taathian torture rituals. The contents of each tome likely played a role in the development of the shop's inventory.   An intricately carved ash bookshelf, an open dark cavern, a closed rune-etched ebony door, and a closed display case are here.

A luxurious pine log building stands at the corner of Rathanus Road and Treewort Avenue. Colorful stained glass windows and ivy-covered balconies grace the exterior of the elegant structure. An ornate silver sign hangs above the entrance engraved with the image of a mug imposed over the outline of a mountain. Upon the sign are words etched in a flowing script which read, "The Silver Mountain Inn". Pleasant music and laughter originate from within.  A pair of open artfully carved oak doors are here.

Stately homes, with manicured lawns and ivy covered fences, rise along both sides of the road. The traffic upon the road is mostly made up of glittering silver horse drawn carriages, patrols of royal guards, and the occasional rickety farmer's wagon. The carriages pull into the entrances of expensive looking homes and depart as quickly as they came, carrying wealthy noblemen off to various locales around the city.  Some large wooden and stone houses, an ivy-covered wrought iron fence, and some wild Rathene roses are here.

The odd looking trio is made up of a tiny Human child playing a tambourine, a beautiful Fir Elf maiden playing a lute, and a Human man, with the largest nose you have ever seen, playing the fiddle. Breathtaking music, the likes of which you have never heard, fills the air as the trio dances around the stage.

The fountain, a tribute to the founding ruler of Rathan, symbolizes Rathanus granting the breath of life to the once barren mountain side. Luminous crystal street lanterns, gilded marble benches, and delicately pruned rose bushes surround the perimeter of the square. Located at the very heart of the city, the plaza serves as a focal point for both business and casual interactions.

Displayed gems and jewels catch any light in the area and throw a colorful spectrum out into the street.

Aside from the main city plaza this part of the city is one of the busiest. Large groups of adventurers, travelers and city natives stand or mill about in front of two large buildings, stepping aside as people walk by. Most of the street-side windows are opened wide, framing breeze blown curtains or homeowners calling out to the avenue below. A light mountain breeze rustles the leaves overhead, the shady trees shifting slightly.  A steel banded oak door and a rune etched morbius door are here.

A crew of broom-wielding Flerians have been put to work sweeping the street clean. Every so often one of them will stoop down and pick up a various bit of trash, smile widely and stuff the new "treasure" into their pocket. Preoccupied travelers make their way along this busy avenue, passing under the tall shade trees and talking softly. To the east, two buildings tower over the others, both sporting a large amount of traffic coming and going.

An immense stone building dominates the southeast corner of the plaza. A trail of black smoke rises from its giant chimney and the sound of hammers striking metal resonates throughout the area. A gilded sign, bearing the image of a suit of armor, hangs above the entrance.  An open silver-trimmed drathain door is here.

A beautiful crystal fountain, topped with the statue of King Rathanus the First, resides at the center of the plaza square. Water sprays from the king's open mouth and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular marble tiled pool. The fountain, a tribute to the founding ruler of Rathan, symbolizes Rathanus granting the breath of life to the once barren mountain side. Luminous crystal street lanterns, gilded marble benches, and delicately pruned rose bushes surround the perimeter of the square. Located at the very heart of the city, the plaza serves as a focal point for both business and casual interactions.  A large glistening silver crystal fountain, some silver gilded marble benches, and some blooming silvery bushes of Rathene roses are here.

This western section of the plaza is fairly quiet, with the exception of the occasional groups of children playing in the street or running errands for their parents. Two scholarly looking Usil Elves casually stroll along the street, their voices low as they discuss the news of the day. One of them glances up sharply as a child's ball rolls across his path. With a slight sneer, the Usilin mage gestures toward the ball and it vanishes with a flash, materializing in the startled child's hand! The Usil Elf mage winks to the child and the pair continue on their way.

Doves call to each other from the tops of two large dogwood trees, the blossoms hanging heavily in the cold air. A stout building, surrounded by flowering tulips and bushy roses, meets the edge of the road. Covered by a grey slate roof, the white painted brick building is well established and well kept. A light plume of smoke rises from the solid stone chimney, the smell mingling with the fragrant scent of honeysuckle.  An open highly polished bluesteel door is here.

Several Human and Hithual warriors rest on the green turf, leaning lazily against the taut canvas side of a green and white tent. A massive mountain wall soars high into the air just west of this small grassy area, seperated from the road by a tall privet hedge. White robed healers enter and exit the open tent flap, carrying healing infusions to those in need.  A green and white canvas tent flap is here.

A beautiful crystal fountain, topped with the statue of King Rathanus the First, resides at the center of the plaza square. Water sprays from the king's open mouth and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular marble tiled pool. The fountain, a tribute to the founding ruler of Rathan, symbolizes Rathanus granting the breath of life to the once barren mountain side. Luminous crystal street lanterns, gilded marble benches, and delicately pruned rose bushes surround the perimeter of the square. Located at the very heart of the city, the plaza serves as a focal point for both business and casual interactions.

Several tall rosewood trees litter the area. Just to the south is a small cliff no more than ten feet high, off of which flows a tiny picturesque waterfall. The multiple footprints in the area suggest this is a popular stopping point for travelers. After hitting the ground, the crystal clear water vanishes among the rocks.

The merchant road ascends slightly to the east as it travels between two mountain peaks. Up the slopes to the north and south is a dense forest with massive red barked trees. Closer to the path, the forest begins to thin out and only a few trees have established themselves close to the road. The merchants who made this road did not bother to go around one of the largest, which is situated directly in the middle of the path.  An ancient towering rosewood tree is here.

The road is almost non-existent. The many large granite boulders that cover the path evidence the instability of the mountains to the north and south. The merchants who travel this road have erected a series of shoddy road signs to direct travelers safely around the boulders. Several of these signs point away from a shadowy area just off the side of the road. The rocks of the area seem to hang over the road slightly, blocking out the light. Light colored stringy material is barely visible along the side of the path.  A flimsy wooden sign, a flimsy wooden sign, and a craggy overhang are here.

A large number of horses, carts, and merchants are congregated off the side of the road. They are either preparing for the journey down the cliff to the southwest, or are resting from the trip in the opposite direction. A dangerously high cliff is visible to the south, while to the east a flat plateau leads the roadway between two large mountains. The green hue of a forest is just visible between them.

Small low-lying bushes with bright red berries dominate this stretch of the road. Many birds of various sizes and colors hop from bush to bush, chirping pleasantly as they feast upon the berries. Just to the northeast, the road ascends over the top of the cliff and out of sight. To the west, most of the merchant road is discernible following along the precarious cliff face.

The cliff face to the north is wet, but there is no apparent source of the moisture. A slight overhang also creates a near permanent shadow in the area, providing a perfect atmosphere for the dense lichen that covers the rocks. Sporadic tufts of grass futilely attempt to assert themselves against the multi-colored lichen, but the spongy fungus prevails. Strange looking spiders scurry about amongst the lichen-covered rocks, before disappearing over the top of the cliff.

There is an extremely large crevasse in the roadway that would normally prevent any further travel along this road. Astoundingly, someone has constructed a very sturdy looking bridge using two perfectly chiseled granite blocks. The blocks make up the support for the bridge structure, which is also constructed of chiseled granite slabs. There is seemingly no explanation for the excellent condition of this stretch of the road.  A sturdy granite bridge is here.

A large pile of animal carcasses in various stages of decay is situated on a precarious ledge halfway up the cliff face. Bloody footprints from some sort of predatory animal are plainly visible along the edge of the path, providing a bit of insight into the decaying animal remains. The road reaches the top of the cliff up the gentle slope to the east.  Some greying oak planks are here.

Several large cracks split the roads surface at odd angles, threatening to swallow unwary travelers. Large and very unsteady wooden boards have been placed across the gaps, creating makeshift bridges. Many of the boards have a significant curve to them, suggesting that they may have been the victim of a rather large traveler.

A large gap in the roadway is now spanned by a rickety looking wood and rope bridge. The slats seem to be spaced just close enough so that a wagon wheel does not get lodged between them. The remnants of the foundations of an old stone bridge are evident on both sides of this gap. A few hundred feet below the present bridge, the former one is visible in several pieces. Considering the state of the old bridge, this unstable replacement does not exactly inspire feelings of safety.  A decrepit looking wood and rope bridge is here.

A large pile of unexplained wooden crates and barrels have been tossed unceremoniously in an alcove off the side of the main road. They have all been scavenged long ago and simply lie abandoned by their owners. For hundreds of feet in either direction, the road surface is covered in deep grooves, making wagon travel quite hazardous. Even at a slow pace the vibrations are intense enough to damage cargo. This is made evident as a heavily laden wagon shudders down the slope. Swearing loudly, the merchant tosses what sounds like a crate full of broken glass into the alcove before continuing onward.  A pile of wooden crates and barrels is here.

The poor construction of this road becomes quickly evident. Water is flowing down over the sides of the cliff above and across the road surface. Due to the slight slope of the road toward the deep chasm to the south, this section of road is quite hazardous. Many broken pieces of rope and metal spikes are strewn all over the pathway; evidently failed attempts to keep wagons from sliding over the side. Large piles of heavy looking stones have now been stacked along the edge of the gorge in hopes it will prevent trade carts from careening off the edge. Several of these stones seem to be missing. Evidently the idea is not working as well as was hoped.  A large pile of stones and a large pile of stones are here.

The cliff face to the north is slightly more sloped than others, allowing far more vegetation to grow on it. Small shapes are visible scurrying about among the grasses and shrubs, most of them reacting to any movement on the road. A few are visible up the road ahead, but quickly vanish at the distant screech of a raptor. It is a few moments before they curiously return.  Some small cute striped chipmunks are here.

Despite the fact the cliffs to the north are nearly vertical, various plants still cling to life against them. Many are common weeds or merely grasses, but some are delicate wildflowers, leaving little or no explanation as to their presence on the cliff. One small tree is also attempting to take root along the cliffside, its branches jutting out at odd angles.  An oddly shaped rosewood tree is here.

Just to the south is the juncture where old merchant road connected to this new road. Just beyond that is the deep gorge that has swallowed up the old road. The road surface is a stable solid rock, but is barely large enough for a single wagon to pass through. Unlike the new merchant road to the southwest, this road follows a more natural flow up the eastern cliffside carefully traversing the steep mountain. A single yellow wildflower grows defiantly out of the rocky cliff, giving a stark contrast to the solid grey that surrounds it.  A small yellow wildflower is here.

A lone carrion bird seems to stare from the branches of a gnarled old tree. The road surface alternates between the usual hard-packed dirt covered in gravel, and solid rock. The terrain creates even more difficult travel for those heading north or south. A large pile of broken wagons, barrels, and boxes lie quite some distance below. Many skeletons of pack animals, picked clean by carrion birds, are also discernible. It is highly likely some of the bones are Humanoid as well.

The road ascends upward at a rather severe angle towards the northwest combined with the shifting road surface, it makes this particular passage very difficult for any merchants traveling with a large quantity of goods. A swiftly flowing river is visible several hundred feet below, and it can only be assumed that it was the cause of the collapse of old merchant road. The audible roar of the river is evident, even this far above.

The old merchant road lies in pieces at the bottom of a deep gorge far below. An artificial pathway has been constructed in the wake of the recent collapse, allowing continued passage through the mountains. This new merchant road has been constructed in great haste and is still quite unstable. Gravel that has been spread on the road to make it safer, is actually making it far more precarious. Pebbles roll continuously off of the roads surface and down into the chasm below.

A treacherous dusty trail leads west along the shaky fault line from a fork in the main road. The original roadbed has fallen into the chasm years ago, leaving the merchants to their own wiles to ply the slippery slopes past the fault zone. Many attempts have failed at conquering the shifting dirt and rocks. Currently a bumpy trail skirts the bigger rocks and loose gravel.

Sections of the mountain have slid away into the valley and the merchant road has been rebuilt higher along the steeper sides of the mountain.

An obnoxious creaking sound can be heard up to the north, as a rusty old gate swings in the dry breeze. The gate offers entrance to the dormant looking town, but provides no defense from intruders.

You stand before a gate about 3 feet high, yellowing and rusty from years of use. It doesn't look like anyone takes care of it regularly. A sign is sticking out of the ground off the side of the path, slightly crooked. The writing on the board is crudely scrawled into the wood, reading "Wolf Trap". You can only assume that is the name given to the quiet town seen past the gate.  An open rusting gate is here.

A treacherous dusty trail leads west along the shaky fault line from a fork in the main road. The original roadbed has fallen into the chasm years ago, leaving the merchants to their own wiles to ply the slippery slopes past the fault zone. Many attempts have failed at conquering the shifting dirt and rocks. Currently a bumpy trail skirts the bigger rocks and loose gravel.

An obnoxious creaking sound can be heard up to the north, as a rusty old gate swings in the dry breeze. The gate offers entrance to the dormant looking town, but provides no defense from intruders.

[Dusty Road.]

You stand before a gate about 3 feet high, yellowing and rusty from years of use. It doesn't look like anyone takes care of it regularly. A sign is sticking out of the ground off the side of the path, slightly crooked. The writing on the board is crudely scrawled into the wood, reading "Wolf Trap". You can only assume that is the name given to the quiet town seen past the gate.  An open rusting gate is here.

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.  A flowing white marble fountain, a marble statue of a Human, a shimmering marble statue of a Dragon, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a rosewood sign, a crisp gold lettered vellum notice, and an empty clay bottle of whiskey are here.

A treacherous dusty trail leads west along the shaky fault line from a fork in the main road. The original roadbed has fallen into the chasm years ago, leaving the merchants to their own wiles to ply the slippery slopes past the fault zone. Many attempts have failed at conquering the shifting dirt and rocks. Currently a bumpy trail skirts the bigger rocks and loose gravel.

As the merchant road approaches the western end of the valley, the valley wall abruptly falls away to a sheer drop. Crumbling rock and dirt spill constantly into the deep abyss. Sections of the mountain have slid away into the valley and the merchant road has been rebuilt higher along the steeper sides of the mountain. The fault line of broken rocks continues its path of destruction to the west, skirted by the land-slide prone softer dirt.   A freshly uncovered crevice is here.

The momentous forces that have wrought this valley still press upon the land and have done so for eons.  The walls of the valley are sheer and steep, and untouched by the raging waters of river or stream.  As if in testimony to the power of the forces that move the land, a huge dark boulder sits off to the side of the road. It is hewn in half like a sliced melon.  One part sits 20 feet north along the break in the rocks from the other part.

The merchant road threads through bottom of the small, narrow valley. Sheer granite walls block the view from the well traveled road to either side and above, only a narrow ray of sky testifies to the time of day. The engineers set a route as far as possible from the broken stones in the center of the valley and, by luck or design, this foresight has saved the road-bed from constant reconstruction. Small cracks run parallel to the road, but none have broken through the thick layers of sand and stone.

Tube shaped holes drilled into the bedrock still remain from when the roadbed was blasted eons ago.

Their roots have plied across the road, upending it's hand laid foundation and hand pounded bed. Several large knees of the oak's roots have leveraged up the edges of the road, hindering all wagons' passage and threatening to break spokes and axles.

Running parallel to the road is a smooth rock lined trench that channels the road's run-off during rainstorms. This flat part of the road that follows the valley floor would be prone to turn into a muddy bog and therefore a hazard to most caravans and their pack animals. Anticipating this event, the road's engineers built drains into the lower side of the road that carry the runoff into the culvert, which carries it harmlessly down to the low end of the valley.

The decaying remains of the bridge workers camp sprawls across this flat valley. To house their draft beasts, the workers constructed small stalls and shelters from rickety boards nailed quixotically to the standing trees. Three brass ring topped posts lie sunk into the grasslands turf, to the south, which was most likely used for tethering grazing animals. Between the posts is a rough stone trough that is filled automatically with water by a rickety mechanical wind mill, whirling lazily in the breeze.

Deeply grooved sled tracks lead to the east towards the bridge from this part of the road where the flatness of the valley was best suited for the staging area during the bridge's reconstruction. Smooth rectangles of tent foundations still mark their location in a semi circle around a blackened fire ring where the workers and their supervisors lived during it's rebuilding.

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.  A flowing white marble fountain, a marble statue of a Human, a shimmering marble statue of a Dragon, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a rosewood sign, a crisp gold lettered vellum notice, and an empty clay bottle of whiskey are here.

Lush grass grows up to the borders of a thick, dense forest that cloaks the hills to the west.

As if steaming from a great cauldron, a heavy ground fog seeps from deep within the forest carrying with it the fresh smell of decomposing green matter.

A rickety criss-crossed rough beam fence pens the grazing of black and white cows whose ponderous forms are barely visible through the tall grass on either side of the road. To the north, the soft, undulating grassland floor of the wide valley succumbs to the rolling foothills, which in turn delineates the imposing outline of a vista-spanning mountain range. Many a traveler has witnessed this idyllic vantage point and has been drawn on to follow the road that travels into the heart of the mountains.

The road diverts around a small pool of murky water that lies to the north. A confusion of hoof prints muddies the shoreline where the placid bovines have come to water themselves. The pool is damned by a small hillock which allows no drainage so the pool remains stagnant. The mountains to the north reflect in perfectly upside-down symmetry on the still pond's surface, only wavering slightly in concentric circles to the deft touch of small insects.

Aged and splintered into the vague circular shape, a decaying wagon wheel is left to rot in the grass by the roadside. Their roots protectively sheltered from the weather, idiosyntric sprouts of taller grasses thrive haphazardly inside the wheel. Several tiny holes top small pyramids of sandy debris, where a few red fire ants scout their wagon-wheel domain for fodder.

As the road bends around a curve, ruts left by merchant's wagons cut so deeply into the mud that all wheeled vehicles are forced to follow the set path. Four loaded wagons of a merchants caravan stand idle as one larger than standard wagon skitters along the path. The buckboard's frame groans and strains to keep it inline while the driver attempts to negotiate the turn. Four dark maned, matched mules balk at the noise behind them, and stomp nervously over the deep ruts. The liveried caravan guards attempt to haul the mules forward, further adding to the mules stubborn refusal to move.

The road charges across a flat valley through waving stalks of grain with coppery tinted seeds. Around the northern edge grows a row of huge cypress trees with trunks that measure eight feet across. Debris from the trees' self-trimming mats the taller grasses into an impenetrable wall. The cypresses produce the necessary windbreak for the field to bear the heavy headed grain.

An enormous smooth round rock splits off a small eddy from the main current resulting a deep, clear pool by the eastern side of the road. The cool calm water catches the reflection of the white snowcapped mountain range further up the valley while the river rushes past towards Spur. Five fishermen recline on folding chairs or against rocks, tethered by the silvery lines of their poles to the fishing hole.

Running parallel to the road is a smooth rock lined trench that channels the road's run-off during rainstorms. This flat part of the road that follows the valley floor would be prone to turn into a muddy bog and therefore a hazard to most caravans and their pack animals. Anticipating this event, the road's engineers built drains into the lower side of the road that carry the runoff into the culvert, which carries it harmlessly down to the low end of the valley.

A great rend in the higher foothills slashes the through the rippled lands resulting in a long, narrow valley. Broken rocks and tumbled boulders fill the agitated valley floor, which harbors little vegetation. The merchant road follows a slight turn in the valley.

Often referred to as "badlands", the sheered rocks, broken cliffs and ridged terrain would be impassable if not for the road. A narrow, steep walled canyon juts to the southeast, disappearing into the convoluted, rippled hills.

A short vibration shudders the roadbed, causing dust and gravel to shimmy down the canyon walls. A few larger rocks ping and ricochet off boulders, until all is deadly silent.  The merchant road is dusted with bits of broken rock, covering any recent tracks.

The rocky valley walls widen to the accommodate the splitting of the Tarath fault line. The Great Divide towers to the north beyond the fractured, broken badlands. Sheer, monolithic cliffs dropping for thousands of feet front the western edge of the mountains; their sharp, snow-capped peaks vaulting nearly vertically from the floor of the fault line valley. The merchant road bed is cracked and broken as it negotiates the larger twists and turns.

A short tremor suddenly rocks the cracked merchant road! A dusty pall sifts into the air from cracks in the ground and the shifting of gravel around the valley.  The tremor rolls through the canyon walls like a ripple, as if it were a linen sheet that was lifted and settled again. Pack animals and travelers alike stop momentarily and then hasten their pace as if to leave the quake behind them.

As the merchant road approaches the western end of the valley, the valley wall abruptly falls away to a sheer drop. Crumbling rock and dirt spill constantly into the deep abyss. Sections of the mountain have slid away into the valley and the merchant road has been rebuilt higher along the steeper sides of the mountain. The fault line of broken rocks continues its path of destruction to the west, skirted by the land-slide prone softer dirt.   A freshly uncovered crevice is here.

Many attempts have failed at conquering the shifting dirt and rocks. Currently a bumpy trail skirts the bigger rocks and loose gravel.

The old merchant road lies in pieces at the bottom of a deep gorge far below. An artificial pathway has been constructed in the wake of the recent collapse, allowing continued passage through the mountains. This new merchant road has been constructed in great haste and is still quite unstable. Gravel that has been spread on the road to make it safer, is actually making it far more precarious. Pebbles roll continuously off of the roads surface and down into the chasm below.

The road ascends upward at a rather severe angle towards the northwest combined with the shifting road surface, it makes this particular passage very difficult for any merchants traveling with a large quantity of goods.

Just to the south is the juncture where old merchant road connected to this new road. Just beyond that is the deep gorge that has swallowed up the old road. The road surface is a stable solid rock, but is barely large enough for a single wagon to pass through. Unlike the new merchant road to the southwest, this road follows a more natural flow up the eastern cliffside carefully traversing the steep mountain. A single yellow wildflower grows defiantly out of the rocky cliff, giving a stark contrast to the solid grey that surrounds it.  A small yellow wildflower is here.

Despite the fact the cliffs to the north are nearly vertical, various plants still cling to life against them. Many are common weeds or merely grasses, but some are delicate wildflowers, leaving little or no explanation as to their presence on the cliff. One small tree is also attempting to take root along the cliffside, its branches jutting out at odd angles.  An oddly shaped rosewood tree is here.

An artificial pathway has been constructed in the wake of the recent collapse, allowing continued passage through the mountains. This new merchant road has been constructed in great haste and is still quite unstable. Gravel that has been spread on the road to make it safer, is actually making it far more precarious. Pebbles roll continuously off of the roads surface and down into the chasm below.

The road ascends upward at a rather severe angle towards the northwest combined with the shifting road surface, it makes this particular passage very difficult for any merchants traveling with a large quantity of goods. A swiftly flowing river is visible several hundred feet below, and it can only be assumed that it was the cause of the collapse of old merchant road. The audible roar of the river is evident, even this far above.

A lone carrion bird seems to stare from the branches of a gnarled old tree. The road surface alternates between the usual hard-packed dirt covered in gravel, and solid rock. The terrain creates even more difficult travel for those heading north or south. A large pile of broken wagons, barrels, and boxes lie quite some distance below. Many skeletons of pack animals, picked clean by carrion birds, are also discernible. It is highly likely some of the bones are Humanoid as well.

Just to the south is the juncture where old merchant road connected to this new road. Just beyond that is the deep gorge that has swallowed up the old road. The road surface is a stable solid rock, but is barely large enough for a single wagon to pass through. Unlike the new merchant road to the southwest, this road follows a more natural flow up the eastern cliffside carefully traversing the steep mountain. A single yellow wildflower grows defiantly out of the rocky cliff, giving a stark contrast to the solid grey that surrounds it.  A small yellow wildflower is here.

The cliffs to the south fall away just for a brief instant at this point on the trail. Two picturesque snow-capped mountain peaks come together in the distance for a lower pass through their forested bases. The white glint of a distant waterfall glistens amongst the green backdrop. The granite road below you continues its precarious trek eastward up the cliffside.

Despite the fact the cliffs to the north are nearly vertical, various plants still cling to life against them. Many are common weeds or merely grasses, but some are delicate wildflowers, leaving little or no explanation as to their presence on the cliff. One small tree is also attempting to take root along the cliffside, its branches jutting out at odd angles.  An oddly shaped rosewood tree is here.

The cliff face to the north is slightly more sloped than others, allowing far more vegetation to grow on it. Small shapes are visible scurrying about among the grasses and shrubs, most of them reacting to any movement on the road. A few are visible up the road ahead, but quickly vanish at the distant screech of a raptor. It is a few moments before they curiously return.  Some small cute striped chipmunks are here.

The poor construction of this road becomes quickly evident. Water is flowing down over the sides of the cliff above and across the road surface. Due to the slight slope of the road toward the deep chasm to the south, this section of road is quite hazardous. Many broken pieces of rope and metal spikes are strewn all over the pathway; evidently failed attempts to keep wagons from sliding over the side. Large piles of heavy looking stones have now been stacked along the edge of the gorge in hopes it will prevent trade carts from careening off the edge. Several of these stones seem to be missing. Evidently the idea is not working as well as was hoped.  A large pile of stones and a large pile of stones are here.

A large pile of unexplained wooden crates and barrels have been tossed unceremoniously in an alcove off the side of the main road. They have all been scavenged long ago and simply lie abandoned by their owners. For hundreds of feet in either direction, the road surface is covered in deep grooves, making wagon travel quite hazardous. Even at a slow pace the vibrations are intense enough to damage cargo. This is made evident as a heavily laden wagon shudders down the slope. Swearing loudly, the merchant tosses what sounds like a crate full of broken glass into the alcove before continuing onward.  A pile of wooden crates and barrels is here.

A large gap in the roadway is now spanned by a rickety looking wood and rope bridge. The slats seem to be spaced just close enough so that a wagon wheel does not get lodged between them. The remnants of the foundations of an old stone bridge are evident on both sides of this gap. A few hundred feet below the present bridge, the former one is visible in several pieces. Considering the state of the old bridge, this unstable replacement does not exactly inspire feelings of safety.  A decrepit looking wood and rope bridge is here.

There is an extremely large crevasse in the roadway that would normally prevent any further travel along this road. Astoundingly, someone has constructed a very sturdy looking bridge using two perfectly chiseled granite blocks. The blocks make up the support for the bridge structure, which is also constructed of chiseled granite slabs. There is seemingly no explanation for the excellent condition of this stretch of the road.  A sturdy granite bridge is here.

The cliff face to the north is wet, but there is no apparent source of the moisture. A slight overhang also creates a near permanent shadow in the area, providing a perfect atmosphere for the dense lichen that covers the rocks. Sporadic tufts of grass futilely attempt to assert themselves against the multi-colored lichen, but the spongy fungus prevails. Strange looking spiders scurry about amongst the lichen-covered rocks, before disappearing over the top of the cliff.

A large number of horses, carts, and merchants are congregated off the side of the road. They are either preparing for the journey down the cliff to the southwest, or are resting from the trip in the opposite direction.

The road is almost non-existent. The many large granite boulders that cover the path evidence the instability of the mountains to the north and south. The merchants who travel this road have erected a series of shoddy road signs to direct travelers safely around the boulders. Several of these signs point away from a shadowy area just off the side of the road. The rocks of the area seem to hang over the road slightly, blocking out the light. Light colored stringy material is barely visible along the side of the path.  A flimsy wooden sign, a flimsy wooden sign, and a craggy overhang are here.

The merchant road ascends slightly to the east as it travels between two mountain peaks. Up the slopes to the north and south is a dense forest with massive red barked trees. Closer to the path, the forest begins to thin out and only a few trees have established themselves close to the road. The merchants who made this road did not bother to go around one of the largest, which is situated directly in the middle of the path.  An ancient towering rosewood tree is here.

The road slopes down slightly to the east, gently following a valley between two large hills. Ground dwelling rodents move about on the arid hill to the north gathering food. Large conifers, capable of withstanding the dry climate, sparsely populate the hill to the south. Visible among the tops of the trees are several majestic red-tailed Rathanian hawks. The screech of the hawks fills the air, as they hunt their small furry prey from above.

A large gap between two large hills to the north and west offers safe passage through this hilly terrain. A cold wind out of the northwest blows stiffly, whipping up the dust. The ground is so dry that most of the topsoil is easily pulled off by the strong winds. Large angry clouds of dust move back and forth throughout the area, wreaking havoc on the eyes and lungs of any that dare to pass through them.  A large thick cloud of dust is here.

A slight wind blows through the area, picking up speed as it continues southeast between two hills. The road drops down to the west through a deep gully before turning out of sight. There is quite a bit of debris on the road in that direction. A family of prairie dogs has dug a series of holes a few meters from the road. One is constantly on watch, attempting to keep the family safe from harm. At the slightest noise, it scurries back into its hole and out of sight.  An animal made hole is here.

One of the walls in this gully has collapsed inward, covering the road surface. The landslide is surely recent, as it is not yet packed down and is still rolling fresh dirt from above. It should be fairly easy to bypass this section of the road by climbing over the shifting dirt. Although surely dangerous, it might be possible to climb up the slide itself.

The merchant road slopes upward gradually to the west. Rocks and shrubs cover much of the path in this area, making it difficult to follow the trail properly.

Ascending gradually to the northwest, the path curves gently along the base of a very large mountain to the north. The terrain is rough, and mostly composed of rock.

This section of the road is all that remains of the former mountain trail. The old pathway is visible to the north, however a large pile of moist earth, dull grey rock, and broken tree trunks has buried it several feet high making further passage impossible. It would seem this area is prone to landslides. A new road has been cut into the terrain to the southwest, heading in the direction of a smaller mountain peak. The old mountain trail is visible as it climbs up the barren mountainside to the north.

The path rises steeply to both the northeast and the west, traveling up the base of two opposing mountain peaks. The smaller peak to the west is far less pronounced than the peak to the northeast. This narrow valley is enclosed on all sides by mountains. Just to the south of the path is a small lake full of what is surely ice cold water. Various small streamlets are visible running down a few of the surrounding snow-capped peaks, ensuring that the icy lake will remain filled.

Old trees lay side by side with the massive boulders of the mountain, intermingling in a terrible landslide. The mountain top has broken off and slid across the eastern road stopping all forms of transportation.

A beautiful crystal fountain, topped with the statue of King Rathanus the First, resides at the center of the plaza square. Water sprays from the king's open mouth and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular marble tiled pool. The fountain, a tribute to the founding ruler of Rathan, symbolizes Rathanus granting the breath of life to the once barren mountain side. Luminous crystal street lanterns, gilded marble benches, and delicately pruned rose bushes surround the perimeter of the square. Located at the very heart of the city, the plaza serves as a focal point for both business and casual interactions.  A large glistening silver crystal fountain, some silver gilded marble benches, and some blooming silvery bushes of Rathene roses are here.

Old trees lay side by side with the massive boulders of the mountain, intermingling in a terrible landslide.

It would take years for mortal hands to remove the tons of stone from the original roadway to make it passable once again. Thankfully, nature has changed the landscape for the better, and has opened a gap through the mountain to the north.

Piles of rubble flank the road on both sides. Some new and some old, this rubble is a mixture of two guard towers and this side of the mountain. High above, the jagged peak of the small mountain thrusts itself out over the road, ready to collapse under the right circumstances. A new rent has been cut into the southeastern side of the mountain, allowing passage to the southern road.

The air is filled with small flecks of falling snow, but none of it looks to be hitting the ground. Small leafless shrubs dominate the landscape, leaving no explanation as to why they all appear to be dead. The main road leads down the mountainside to the east, and up over a crest to the northwest. This spot is approximately halfway up the slope of this cold mountain peak. The merchant road is visible to the east, making its way slowly out of the Tarath Bends.

Small rocks and pebbles tumble over the edge of a sharp drop off to the south. In the distance over the edge of the cliff, through two rather large hills, a city with octagonal walls surrounding it is just visible. The road here is rather narrow, pushing as far against the cliff face as possible. The pathway continues to ascend to the west, making its way up the mountainside.

The road bends to the southwest around a large boulder as it slopes up the side of this mountain. From this vantage point, large imposing jagged peaks of the mountains above Rathan are visible. Each peak is heavily laden with snow, with only small sections of rock visible. A trail, presumably this one, is also visible traveling northward toward the peaks in the distance.

The path rises steeply to both the northeast and the west, traveling up the base of two opposing mountain peaks. The smaller peak to the west is far less pronounced than the peak to the northeast. This narrow valley is enclosed on all sides by mountains. Just to the south of the path is a small lake full of what is surely ice cold water. Various small streamlets are visible running down a few of the surrounding snow-capped peaks, ensuring that the icy lake will remain filled.

This section of the road is all that remains of the former mountain trail. The old pathway is visible to the north, however a large pile of moist earth, dull grey rock, and broken tree trunks has buried it several feet high making further passage impossible. It would seem this area is prone to landslides. A new road has been cut into the terrain to the southwest, heading in the direction of a smaller mountain peak. The old mountain trail is visible as it climbs up the barren mountainside to the north.

Ascending gradually to the northwest, the path curves gently along the base of a very large mountain to the north. The terrain is rough, and mostly composed of rock.

The merchant road slopes upward gradually to the west. Rocks and shrubs cover much of the path in this area, making it difficult to follow the trail properly.

One of the walls in this gully has collapsed inward, covering the road surface. The landslide is surely recent, as it is not yet packed down and is still rolling fresh dirt from above. It should be fairly easy to bypass this section of the road by climbing over the shifting dirt. Although surely dangerous, it might be possible to climb up the slide itself.

A slight wind blows through the area, picking up speed as it continues southeast between two hills. The road drops down to the west through a deep gully before turning out of sight. There is quite a bit of debris on the road in that direction. A family of prairie dogs has dug a series of holes a few meters from the road. One is constantly on watch, attempting to keep the family safe from harm. At the slightest noise, it scurries back into its hole and out of sight.  An animal made hole is here.

A large gap between two large hills to the north and west offers safe passage through this hilly terrain. A cold wind out of the northwest blows stiffly, whipping up the dust. The ground is so dry that most of the topsoil is easily pulled off by the strong winds. Large angry clouds of dust move back and forth throughout the area, wreaking havoc on the eyes and lungs of any that dare to pass through them.  A large thick cloud of dust is here.

The road slopes down slightly to the east, gently following a valley between two large hills. Ground dwelling rodents move about on the arid hill to the north gathering food. Large conifers, capable of withstanding the dry climate, sparsely populate the hill to the south. Visible among the tops of the trees are several majestic red-tailed Rathanian hawks. The screech of the hawks fills the air, as they hunt their small furry prey from above.

This area of the path is fairly nondescript. A sparsely forested hill rises steeply to the south while a rocky grass covered hill rises to the north. Neither is particularly spectacular, save a lone male deer which grazes at a higher elevation on the southern hill. A few spare patches of grass grow alongside the path. The environment becomes more arid to the west.

Where there was once a craggy rock-studded earthen cliff, a massive rent has formed. Through the cleft to the southwest, travel seems possible.

Tufts of dried grass intermixed with broken rock cover the ground of this makeshift merchant road. The vicious rend that created this pathway reaches its lowest point here, drastically sloping upward in both directions. Massive walls of constantly shifting rock and earth stand a few hundred feet in the air to the southwest and the northeast. Every now and then a few rocks tumble down the sides on top the heads of unwary travelers.

The tranquil terrain has been torn asunder to the northwest. One of the forces of nature has caused a great fissure to open in the earth. Although the fissure slopes downward at a severe angle, the terrain is surprisingly smooth and could be navigated even by a goods-loaded wagon. To the east a great deal of grass is growing on the road itself. It almost seems as if no one has used that road in a while.

Several tall rosewood trees litter the area. Just to the south is a small cliff no more than ten feet high, off of which flows a tiny picturesque waterfall.

The merchant road ascends slightly to the east as it travels between two mountain peaks. Up the slopes to the north and south is a dense forest with massive red barked trees. Closer to the path, the forest begins to thin out and only a few trees have established themselves close to the road. The merchants who made this road did not bother to go around one of the largest, which is situated directly in the middle of the path.  An ancient towering rosewood tree is here.

The road is almost non-existent. The many large granite boulders that cover the path evidence the instability of the mountains to the north and south. The merchants who travel this road have erected a series of shoddy road signs to direct travelers safely around the boulders. Several of these signs point away from a shadowy area just off the side of the road. The rocks of the area seem to hang over the road slightly, blocking out the light. Light colored stringy material is barely visible along the side of the path.  A flimsy wooden sign, a flimsy wooden sign, and a craggy overhang are here.

A large number of horses, carts, and merchants are congregated off the side of the road. They are either preparing for the journey down the cliff to the southwest, or are resting from the trip in the opposite direction.

The cliff face to the north is wet, but there is no apparent source of the moisture. A slight overhang also creates a near permanent shadow in the area, providing a perfect atmosphere for the dense lichen that covers the rocks. Sporadic tufts of grass futilely attempt to assert themselves against the multi-colored lichen, but the spongy fungus prevails. Strange looking spiders scurry about amongst the lichen-covered rocks, before disappearing over the top of the cliff.

There is an extremely large crevasse in the roadway that would normally prevent any further travel along this road. Astoundingly, someone has constructed a very sturdy looking bridge using two perfectly chiseled granite blocks. The blocks make up the support for the bridge structure, which is also constructed of chiseled granite slabs. There is seemingly no explanation for the excellent condition of this stretch of the road.  A sturdy granite bridge is here.

Several large cracks split the roads surface at odd angles, threatening to swallow unwary travelers.

A large gap in the roadway is now spanned by a rickety looking wood and rope bridge. The slats seem to be spaced just close enough so that a wagon wheel does not get lodged between them. The remnants of the foundations of an old stone bridge are evident on both sides of this gap. A few hundred feet below the present bridge, the former one is visible in several pieces. Considering the state of the old bridge, this unstable replacement does not exactly inspire feelings of safety.  A decrepit looking wood and rope bridge is here.

A large pile of unexplained wooden crates and barrels have been tossed unceremoniously in an alcove off the side of the main road. They have all been scavenged long ago and simply lie abandoned by their owners. For hundreds of feet in either direction, the road surface is covered in deep grooves, making wagon travel quite hazardous. Even at a slow pace the vibrations are intense enough to damage cargo. This is made evident as a heavily laden wagon shudders down the slope. Swearing loudly, the merchant tosses what sounds like a crate full of broken glass into the alcove before continuing onward.  A pile of wooden crates and barrels is here.

The poor construction of this road becomes quickly evident. Water is flowing down over the sides of the cliff above and across the road surface. Due to the slight slope of the road toward the deep chasm to the south, this section of road is quite hazardous. Many broken pieces of rope and metal spikes are strewn all over the pathway; evidently failed attempts to keep wagons from sliding over the side. Large piles of heavy looking stones have now been stacked along the edge of the gorge in hopes it will prevent trade carts from careening off the edge. Several of these stones seem to be missing. Evidently the idea is not working as well as was hoped.  A large pile of stones and a large pile of stones are here.

Small shapes are visible scurrying about among the grasses and shrubs, most of them reacting to any movement on the road.

Despite the fact the cliffs to the north are nearly vertical, various plants still cling to life against them. Many are common weeds or merely grasses, but some are delicate wildflowers, leaving little or no explanation as to their presence on the cliff.

Just to the south is the juncture where old merchant road connected to this new road. Just beyond that is the deep gorge that has swallowed up the old road. The road surface is a stable solid rock, but is barely large enough for a single wagon to pass through. Unlike the new merchant road to the southwest, this road follows a more natural flow up the eastern cliffside carefully traversing the steep mountain. A single yellow wildflower grows defiantly out of the rocky cliff, giving a stark contrast to the solid grey that surrounds it.  A small yellow wildflower is here.

The terrain creates even more difficult travel for those heading north or south. A large pile of broken wagons, barrels, and boxes lie quite some distance below. Many skeletons of pack animals, picked clean by carrion birds, are also discernible. It is highly likely some of the bones are Humanoid as well.

The road ascends upward at a rather severe angle towards the northwest combined with the shifting road surface, it makes this particular passage very difficult for any merchants traveling with a large quantity of goods.

The old merchant road lies in pieces at the bottom of a deep gorge far below. An artificial pathway has been constructed in the wake of the recent collapse, allowing continued passage through the mountains. This new merchant road has been constructed in great haste and is still quite unstable. Gravel that has been spread on the road to make it safer, is actually making it far more precarious. Pebbles roll continuously off of the roads surface and down into the chasm below.

Many attempts have failed at conquering the shifting dirt and rocks. Currently a bumpy trail skirts the bigger rocks and loose gravel.

As the merchant road approaches the western end of the valley, the valley wall abruptly falls away to a sheer drop. Crumbling rock and dirt spill constantly into the deep abyss. Sections of the mountain have slid away into the valley and the merchant road has been rebuilt higher along the steeper sides of the mountain. The fault line of broken rocks continues its path of destruction to the west, skirted by the land-slide prone softer dirt.   A freshly uncovered crevice is here.

A short tremor suddenly rocks the cracked merchant road! A dusty pall sifts into the air from cracks in the ground and the shifting of gravel around the valley.  The tremor rolls through the canyon walls like a ripple, as if it were a linen sheet that was lifted and settled again. Pack animals and travelers alike stop momentarily and then hasten their pace as if to leave the quake behind them.

Sheer, monolithic cliffs dropping for thousands of feet front the western edge of the mountains; their sharp, snow-capped peaks vaulting nearly vertically from the floor of the fault line valley. The merchant road bed is cracked and broken as it negotiates the larger twists and turns.

The merchant road threads through bottom of the small, narrow valley. Sheer granite walls block the view from the well traveled road to either side and above, only a narrow ray of sky testifies to the time of day. The engineers set a route as far as possible from the broken stones in the center of the valley and, by luck or design, this foresight has saved the road-bed from constant reconstruction. Small cracks run parallel to the road, but none have broken through the thick layers of sand and stone.

Tube shaped holes drilled into the bedrock still remain from when the roadbed was blasted eons ago.

Crunching loudly on the road is a ankle high deposit of acorn hulls and their discarded caps. Quick footed grey squirrels dash across the road, or above on the high intertwined branches of the stately oaks, with the highly coveted acorns grasped firmly in their teeth. The squirrels flash their tails at each other in some unknown signal as traffic passes on the road.  A pile of empty acorn caps is here.

The grassland plateau is embraced by a stand of dark green oak trees so thick that little light passes through the profusion of their many lobed leaves. The forest is ancient and the trunks of the trees bare witness to fires, lightning strikes and the attacks of insects. Large gout-like burls disfigure some of the wide, grey trunks which have grown quietly next to the road for hundreds of years.

The merchant roads widens as it travels another grass swept plateau. The mountain range fills the northern skyline in stark detail. Huge snow capped peaks and rough faced cliffs are close enough to see the individual boulders, waterfalls, and haphazard game trails. Much higher up the great mountainsides a line where trees stop growing gives testament to the altitude. The air is cool.

The roadway takes advantage of a cut in the hill to negotiate a tumbled cliff face. At the top of the hill is a high, flat, steppe grassland, and at the bottom is the edge of the open range. At one point, the road narrows to cross a small stream. Very little mud gathers in the shallows of the stream and the pebbles and rocks glitter like gold as the wagon wheels churn the gravel.

Running parallel to the road is a smooth rock lined trench that channels the road's run-off during rainstorms. This flat part of the road that follows the valley floor would be prone to turn into a muddy bog and therefore a hazard to most caravans and their pack animals. Anticipating this event, the road's engineers built drains into the lower side of the road that carry the runoff into the culvert, which carries it harmlessly down to the low end of the valley.

The decaying remains of the bridge workers camp sprawls across this flat valley. To house their draft beasts, the workers constructed small stalls and shelters from rickety boards nailed quixotically to the standing trees. Three brass ring topped posts lie sunk into the grasslands turf, to the south, which was most likely used for tethering grazing animals. Between the posts is a rough stone trough that is filled automatically with water by a rickety mechanical wind mill, whirling lazily in the breeze.

Boulders stacked in pyramids contained by large timbers stand mutely to the side of the roadway next to an impromptu dump of broken tools, wooden stakes and empty buckets lined with mortar. Deeply grooved sled tracks lead to the east towards the bridge from this part of the road where the flatness of the valley was best suited for the staging area during the bridge's reconstruction. Smooth rectangles of tent foundations still mark their location in a semi circle around a blackened fire ring where the workers and their supervisors lived during it's rebuilding.

A massive stone bridge spans a raging grey tinted river as it runs it's course towards the southeast. The mud around the bridge footings has been churned by wheels of quarry wagons, tracks of sleds bearing block and tackle, shod hooves of draft beasts and booted feet of masons and bridge workers. The newer parts of the huge bridge are obvious due to the contrast in colors of mortar and rock. Bright banners snap briskly in the wind from both ends of the bridge.

A few proud workers chiseled their initials and the date into their handiwork, most reading the date of Rinannimas, 6th month, 61st day, year 313.

An enormous smooth round rock splits off a small eddy from the main current resulting a deep, clear pool by the eastern side of the road. The cool calm water catches the reflection of the white snowcapped mountain range further up the valley while the river rushes past towards Spur. Five fishermen recline on folding chairs or against rocks, tethered by the silvery lines of their poles to the fishing hole. Each fisherman is spread evenly around the pool as if held apart by some invisible barrier as they eye the large shadowy fish shapes finning effortlessly against the mild current in the eddy.

Four loaded wagons of a merchants caravan stand idle as one larger than standard wagon skitters along the path. The buckboard's frame groans and strains to keep it inline while the driver attempts to negotiate the turn. Four dark maned, matched mules balk at the noise behind them, and stomp nervously over the deep ruts. The liveried caravan guards attempt to haul the mules forward, further adding to the mules stubborn refusal to move.

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.  A flowing white marble fountain, a marble statue of a Human, a shimmering marble statue of a Dragon, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a rosewood sign, and a crisp gold lettered vellum notice are here.

The gaze of their peaceful eyes seems to follow your every movement.  An open intricately gilded iron gate, a pair of pure white marble dove statues, and a street lantern are here.

A large stone building rises just to the east of Northern Avenue. These barracks house those known as Dread Knights. It is not unusual to see patrols of this elite group heading down the street towards Town Square. One would hope their presence would allow everyone to live in peace. If only they would stop fingering their swords all the time, you might believe it yourself.  A street lantern is here.

Northern Avenue ends at a gateway set within the massive city walls. On the other side of the gate are the Guild Halls. Those who pass through accept the bond of peace that the Guilds impose on all who desire their services. On either side of the gate guards stand at attention saluting all those who pass by.  An open iron gate, an open thick stone door, and a street lantern are here.

The massive building of the Merchant's Guild looms over a vast part of the guild district. The activity at the main door of the guild is mind numbing as hundreds of citizens and merchants alike rush in and out of the guild to handle their business. While the governor has control over the city guard, many claim it is the Merchant's Guild that runs the city of Spur.  An open exquisite polished mahogany door and a street lantern are here.

Through the gate you can see the guild district bustling with its day-to-day activity, a far cry from these peaceful and quiet streets.

From within you can hear the horrible sounds of would be musicians playing their versions of such Spurian favorites as "Chunky Stone Potina" and "The Lost Soul Song." It's nothing short of a miracle the owner of the store can stand listening to the horrid attempts of untrained musicians all day. Perhaps it's punishment for breaking some sort of noise ordinance...
