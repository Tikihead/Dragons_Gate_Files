Wavering white-hot orange flames swirl from a large opal disk that hovers as a centerpiece in this immense tree. Gnarled wooden stairs spiral and climb up the walls of the rounded bough, disappearing into a dark zenith. Shapeless figures dance and undulate on the walls, creating a spectacle of slow spinning shadows that unfurl into jackals and snakes. Howls of delights roar then fade into the distance as merrymakers disappear down a slithering slide, which cascades into a void of darkness way below.  An open star etched amber door, some steep spiraling stairs, and a wickedly curled slide are here.

Snakelike flames lick the air above, as shadows stand motionlessly against the hasty draft that cuts like a serpent's tongue through the underground roots. A circlet of paper demons crowns the tree's lifeless roots, which dig into the earth like knotted joints. Tiny black bugs cover the base of the tree's trunk as small figures burrow themselves in a large dark hole.  A small dark dirt hole is here.

Walls of pressed earth and roughly cut stone surround a haphazard assortment of various trinkets and tools scattered across the floor. Two matching boxes sit next to each other near the burrows entrance. Feeble light flickers from a small magickally glowing yellowish ball, which is encased within a metal lantern that sits on a black wooden desk. Shadows obscure a pair of closed, locked boxes jutting out from underneath the desk.  A small dark dirt hole, a narrow dirt tunnel, and a pair of glowing demon carved pumpkins are here.

Tiny morsels overflow from glass jars, as steam swirls from a cauldron of bubbling witches' brew. Dressed in a bloodstained apron, a cross-eyed Go-blin-al stands behind the wooden counter that is formed from an oversized tree root. Tattered garlands, stolen from the Elindale festival, decorate the small shoppe. As a foul smelling wind stirs the air, the small merchant fans a crooked hand behind him. Baskets of freshly baked pastries and body parts tantalize the senses with delightful repulsion, while cheerfully dressed Secians circle around the black cloth covered tables, escaping the grasp of snot nosed patrons.  A glowing stone fireplace, some short black and gold tables and chairs, a narrow dirt tunnel, and an open dusty wooden trapdoor are here.

Crimson, golden, and orange leaves tangle harshly with the wind as the night air cuts through the twisted branches boastfully. An ashen tree, whose branches are like a crippled old woman's hand, hangs heavily over a large glass tank. Red crystal apples bob rapidly as the chill of night stirs the water inside the tank. As the water churns and the wind rushes through the trees, a flock of black birds escape hastily from the branches above, sending a whirlwind of leaves to the ground.  An apple filled glass tank and a pair of glowing vine-covered pumpkins are here.

An old gray haired woman sits on a giant rocking chair, rocking back and forth slowly as she stares out a small dusty window. She cackles dramatically as if lost in a bizarre daydream, before she begins to hum a bizarre tune off key.  The notes fall and rise in an eerie melody, as the woman's glazed pale blue eyes roll inward and outward as she slowly weaves another stitch.

A high pitched cackle rings madly from behind a large iron door. Large white sheets with painted faces dangle from the ceiling, as a cool draft blows in from the creaking star etched wooden door. Bales of hale are scattered across the dusty floor as patrons await their "surgery." An extremely tall, lanky fellow stands beside the iron door, insisting that he was once the size of a Secian.  An open star etched wooden door, some bales of hay, some bales of hay, and an open heavy iron door are here.

A gnarled willow tree stands like a towering shadow over a small crooked shack. The tree's long, skeletal branches blow furiously with the wind, stinging the frigid air like a whip. A misty trail of white smoke slinks steadily in coiled rings from a stone chimney that hardly balances on the slanted rooftop. A silver trimmed owl rests like an ancient sentinel on the stacked stones. Its golden eyes reflect the halo of the full moon. Shrilled laughter mixed with eerie cries of terror carry on the hasty wind as the star etched wooden door swings on its hinges.  An open star etched wooden door and some glowing intricately carved pumpkins are here.

Curls of flames lick the crisp black night air as a cloud of smoke eddies upward, weaving a snaky trail through the velvet sky lit by twilight. The sweet, spicy scent of burning wood carries on the air, giving warmth to the stinging chill of the rushing wind. A circle of merrymakers sit around the fire, warming their hands as others chase and dance through the leafless trees that stand like wicked figures in the darkness.  A flaming bonfire and a glowing large rune inscribed pumpkin are here.

Crimson, golden, and orange leaves tangle harshly with the wind as the night air cuts through the twisted branches boastfully. An ashen tree, whose branches are like a crippled old woman's hand, hangs heavily over a large glass tank. Red crystal apples bob rapidly as the chill of night stirs the water inside the tank. As the water churns and the wind rushes through the trees, a flock of black birds escape hastily from the branches above, sending a whirlwind of leaves to the ground.

The air of excitement around the grand ghoul's arena is palpable. The crowds mill about, some mute with trepidation, others proclaiming loudly which creation will triumph in the matches. Upon entering the elliptical Colosseum, visitors climb sloping ramps to tiers of stone seats. A fence surrounds the fighting arena for the spectators' protection against wild beast attacks.  A stone arch and some glowing intricately carved pumpkins are here.

This area is illuminated.
