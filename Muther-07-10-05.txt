An enormous circle of smooth oak columns create the walls of the Great Room. From the door, the hard-packed floor descends to a blazing fire pit with aromatic woods such as apple wood, orange and juniper. Fragrant braided sweet-grass mats are placed randomly around the fire pit. Horn sconces bearing beeswax candles emit a soft light, which permeates the room. A simple, yet elegant redwood plaque adorns the far wall. Carved into this plaque is a dedication. A golden flag is prominently displayed against one wall. Mounted above the grand oak door is a leather banner that has "Walk in Honor" branded into it. A Saldaean crafted, walnut weapons case stands in the corner of the room. Various Leuian symbols are hammered into the moonsilver panels adorning the case's doors. A highly polished, maple pantry sits next to the weapons case and bears the mark of the Leuian warrior on each of it's doors.  An east corridor, a west corridor, a golden flag, a redwood plaque, an open leather door, a closed grand oak door, an open Saldean crafted walnut weapons case, an open Leuian crafted oak trunk, and an open polished maple pantry are here.

[Meetpoint Square.]

Within the heart of this proud fort one can see all around that the reconstruction of its buildings has begun. Large stones and logs have been stacked and piled, while some workers tirelessly attempt to repair the damage that occurred here during the Lords of Chaos wars. The buildings and homes of the people that resided here are slowly taking shape, though, far from completed. The smell of dyes, used to paint the town, permeate the area.  A breathtaking shimmering bouquet of moonflowers, an open light blue door, and a glowing wrought iron street lantern are here.

[Meetpoint.]

Here a gate leads out of the fort and into the Southern regions. Several children run and play just inside the gate, under the watchful eyes of the guards. What was once a very well used trade route has slowed to some caravans bringing supplies for the townsmen and the occasional merchants traveling from the far southern reaches of the land. Many guards protect this section of the fort as it is home to some wild beasts that live outside these walls. In the distance, you can make out two more guards hunting the frogmen that often try to attack the city and caravans.  An open large sturdy wooden gate and a glowing wrought iron lantern are here.

[Meetpoint gate.]

A few guards do a roving patrol of the area and down to the bridge. They check the caravans before they enter and anyone that looks suspicious they throw into the river. They seem quite wary of anyone coming or going to and from the city. From their appearance it would seem best to stay on their good sides and hope that they are in good moods.  An open large sturdy wooden gate, a stone bridge, and a floating pontoon bridge are here.

[Darkith River Bridge.]

Shuddering and shifting under the weight of all but the smallest travelers, this floating bridge plies the churning dark waters of the Darkith with ponderous grace. Thick hand sawed planks are tied together with huge twisted hemp ropes and cushioned with rubber bumpers to ease the constant ebb of the river's flow.  Each tar-coated plank moves independantly of the others, causing serpentine twists in the bridge's original shape.    A floating pontoon bridge and a floating pontoon bridge are here.

[Commodore Island.]

Sand, debris, rocks, and finally soil deposited by the Darkith river over thousands of years have piled against a natural rock barrier to create an inter-river island.  The course of the mighty Darkith has altered slightly to accomodate the building bulk of the island and now flows on both sides.  Rapids sluice on the east and west side of this island, filling the air with a damp mist that sits heavily on the countryside.  A floating pontoon bridge is here.

[Commodore Island Park]

A wide avenue paved with gravel cuts the gentle slope of the island's north side and bears the mark of heavy equipment being transported to the interior of the island.   Various stacks of rocks are spaced out along the road and translate into coded messages for the workers to follow.  The roaring rapids of the Darkith fill the air with a constant mist as the water tumbles past the island.

A worn rock cliff-face juts out from the island's hillside, its worn edges descending steeply until it finally dives down into the depths of the river.  The river's current boils angrily against the staunch rocks, working to tear their very existence into pebbles and sand.  A smooth tunnel paved with flat stones and supported by solid wooden beams cuts through the cliff.  A smooth dark stone tunnel, a Hithual crafted oak barrel, and a huge pile of dirt are here.

The churning waters of the Darkith continue their journey to the ocean beyond the protection of the rocky breakwater to the east.  A small safe harbor sits unflaggingly in the resulting eddy, bolstered by the sand and silt erosion of the Great Divide far beyond the horizon, to the Northeast.  A tidy village hugs the river's edge taking full advantage of the lush island growth and natural haven.  An open smooth stone tunnel, a stack of rocks, and some deep muddy cart tracks are here.

Under the canopy of the huge trees, the cooling peace of the forest mists continues to caress the earth amongst the sweeping fern leaves. Two immense redwood trees, grandfathers to their smaller brethren, stand as silent guardians at the entrance to a natural park. The giants are marked by great rents from limbs lost in mighty winds and scars from both fire and mortal carelessness; yet the ancient trees bear these scars like honored badges, a testament to the vast history of this forest. The limbs of the grandfather conifers cross in a beautiful but simple arch over the path between the trees leading into the park.  A pair of tall ancient redwood trees, a closed wrought iron gate, and a stack of rocks are here.

Far above the forest floor, the looming trees' canopy shades the park's paths. Every few feet a break in the leaves lights a fortunate fern or clover patch that languishes in the gift from the heavens. A giant among oaks, dwarfed by the mighty conifers enjoys such a boon.  Its twisted branches decry the battle to survive beneath the taller competitors. Nestled in the crotches of the oak branches, beautiful orchids thrive and bloom despite the weather, causing many of the villagers to believe that the goddess herself has adopted the oak as one of her protected monuments. The villagers have placed benches made of koy around the oak that complement the park without detracting from its natural beauty.  An ancient gnarled oak tree, some fragrant amber orchids, a beautiful hand-carved koy wood bench, a stack of rocks, and an ivy covered sandstone arch are here.

An idyllic path leads past the looming giant sentinel trees and forks as it heads into the village. The path is flat, edged with beautiful river rocks, and paved with a layer of fragrant wood chips.

A soothing peace has settled over the forest here at the center of the park, where the mists coalesce and then dance back out again amongst the trees. Many small rivulets of water feed into an indent atop a large collection of boulders. As the water overflows the pool, it spills across the sides of the stone to trickle down the steps of the rock formation. Smaller pools are formed as it cascades over the rock until at last the rivulets are reunited into a single small stream which finds its way home to the larger river. Delicate flowering moss has grown over the stones of this centerpiece of the forest, and a small family of larks takes delight in bathing beneath the tiny waterfalls and mossy pools, even as the melodic chirping of other birds wafts through the tree branches all around.  A stack of rocks and a closed door are here.

The multi-tiered fountain flows with pure, clean springwater and provides seating around its broad base.  The towering trees surround the village, enclosing the square in a living frame.  To the west is a sturdy building with its door perpetually ajar. A line of Leuian children trots off towards the north, bearing their lessons. The faint ding of nautical bells flows in on the breeze from the northwest.   A flowing gold-flecked sandstone fountain is here.

An immense, smoothed river boulder deposited by the river, eons ago, is imbedded in the soft loam of the forest floor and blocks the view of the river to the north. A few giant trees have grown bent around its rounded shape and an innovative homeowner has taken advantage of the resulting shelter. Built carefully among the trees in the lee of the rock, stands a magnificent example of the same peaked wooden beam homes that dot the entire forest. One fledgling tree pokes its head through a well-planned hole in the roof.  A pair of closed magnificent carved steelwood doors, a slippery downhill path, and a stack of rocks are here.

The playful melodies of Leuian children's tunes dance about the air as the shops and homes here take on a more whimsical atmosphere. Leuian khits strain away from their parents' arms to press eager faces against the storefront glass and gaze at the displays of toys and sweets with wonder filled eyes. A Leuian confectioner smiles as he takes a piece of taffy off the top of his candy house display and shares it with the delighted child. Across the street, a wide bay window display is filled with every kind and color of spinning top.

The chipped bark path widens to encompass a broad square between the peaked roofs of the village homes, the larger storefronts, and several communal buildings that all surround a magnificent fountain crafted from local sandstone. The multi-tiered fountain flows with pure, clean springwater and provides seating around its broad base.  The towering trees surround the village, enclosing the square in a living frame.  To the west is a sturdy building with its door perpetually ajar. A line of Leuian children trots off towards the north, bearing their lessons. The faint ding of nautical bells flows in on the breeze from the northwest.   A flowing gold-flecked sandstone fountain is here.

A tall, plain building occupies the west edge of the square. The door remains open, its wood smoothed by the touch of hands and its kick plate, dented and scuffed.  Several adult Leuians discuss current events in hushed tones as small khits dash around them, playing a game of Alarian tag.    A hand-carved redwood sign is here.

The southwest corner of the square is dominated by a several storefronts. Merchants place their wares on display on linen covered tables. Villagers wander from table to table, examining the items and discussing their merits and price. There is little disagreement or haggling, as all prices are fair and the merchants are confident in the quality. Bright flags wave lazily from the eaves of the buildings as the waterborne wind bears the scent of the docks into town.

                        You have visualized the following locations
                        -------------------------------------------

                                    Visualization #1 is:
Through the gate lies the city of Spur, the major center of trade and civilization on the plains. The dusty road leading through the gates is well traveled, and walls of the city are in good repair. A small shack sits to the west of the road, during most times of the day a dusty coach can be seen waiting in front, its horses stomping with impatience to be gone. To the right of the door is a small window, its opening covered with metal bars. An old man, missing most of his teeth, waits patiently for the travelers to pay their fare, and then directs them into the waiting area. On the east side of the road a billowing multicolored tent has been erected, the hustle and bustle of merchants and customers can be seen coming and going at all times of the day.

                                    Visualization #2 is:
Each corner of this square gives entrance to one of the fort's four business establishments. The bank is small, but adequate. The pawnshop and store will see to your buying and selling needs, and the Tarath Wayside Inn is open at all hours to provide shelter for residents and foreigners alike.

                                    Visualization #3 is:
Carefully winding its way up the base of the tree, and wrapping itself around the stairs, a flowering jasmine vine grows tall and lush. Dark scars from a past fire are almost hidden under tufts of fresh growth and moss. A large gap, nearly sixteen feet in distance, rests between the base of a set of stairs and the forest floor. A long moonsilver cord hangs down the side of the tree. If one pulls it, the long Elven rope will descend from above, allowing them to enter the great city of Treehaven. Bright green leaves of clover have begun springing up through the ashy soil in conjunction with soft moss to lend a durable cushion to this well-traveled spot.

The chipped bark path widens to encompass a broad square between the peaked roofs of the village homes, the larger storefronts, and several communal buildings that all surround a magnificent fountain crafted from local sandstone. The multi-tiered fountain flows with pure, clean springwater and provides seating around its broad base.  The towering trees surround the village, enclosing the square in a living frame.  To the west is a sturdy building with its door perpetually ajar. A line of Leuian children trots off towards the north, bearing their lessons. The faint ding of nautical bells flows in on the breeze from the northwest.   A flowing gold-flecked sandstone fountain is here.

                                    Visualization #1 is:
Through the gate lies the city of Spur, the major center of trade and civilization on the plains. The dusty road leading through the gates is well traveled, and walls of the city are in good repair. A small shack sits to the west of the road, during most times of the day a dusty coach can be seen waiting in front, its horses stomping with impatience to be gone. To the right of the door is a small window, its opening covered with metal bars. An old man, missing most of his teeth, waits patiently for the travelers to pay their fare, and then directs them into the waiting area. On the east side of the road a billowing multicolored tent has been erected, the hustle and bustle of merchants and customers can be seen coming and going at all times of the day.

                                    Visualization #2 is:
Each corner of this square gives entrance to one of the fort's four business establishments. The bank is small, but adequate. The pawnshop and store will see to your buying and selling needs, and the Tarath Wayside Inn is open at all hours to provide shelter for residents and foreigners alike.

                                    Visualization #3 is:
Carefully winding its way up the base of the tree, and wrapping itself around the stairs, a flowering jasmine vine grows tall and lush. Dark scars from a past fire are almost hidden under tufts of fresh growth and moss. A large gap, nearly sixteen feet in distance, rests between the base of a set of stairs and the forest floor. A long moonsilver cord hangs down the side of the tree. If one pulls it, the long Elven rope will descend from above, allowing them to enter the great city of Treehaven. Bright green leaves of clover have begun springing up through the ashy soil in conjunction with soft moss to lend a durable cushion to this well-traveled spot.

The occasional locked gate marks the entrance to some of the more hidden estates of Spurs nobility. From this broad avenue, little can be seen of their splendor. Behind the imposing gate recedes a proud drive, disappearing mysteriously into the trees.

The boughs of a large apple tree hang over the well tended avenue. Below the beautiful tree stands a small fountain. Atop the fountain is an intricately carved Secian who appears to be dancing with the water as it splashes around her. Set in the marble base is a small plaque that reads, "For those who have gone before us." Many stand for a moment as they pass this way, giving thanks for the gift of life that is given by both the apple tree and the Secians of long ago. Large piles of dirt and broken stone lay on either side of the street as workmen ready the east and west alleys for expansion.  A street lantern, an open Secian etched moonsilver door, a pair of open silver forged swinging doors, and a sign above the doors are here.

Vast estates tower over the huge Spurian wall towards the south. The well-to-do who live in these homes idle away their days, enjoying the luxury of time. Standing next to a very empty lantern pole, a small Flerian child insists in a plaintive wail, that he had nothing to do with the missing lantern. The well-dressed guard that interrogates him keeps pointing at a small sack on the ground and its obvious contents.  An open small burlap sack, a street lantern, and a lantern are here.

It is not unusual to see a young adventurer peeking out the imposing double doors, indecision in their countenance.

The rest of the street seems to mimic the splendor of the estates beyond the wall. Swept and trimmed, the roadway exudes a simple, yet beautiful elegance.  A street lantern is here.

A small roadway bordered by flowering hedges bisects the wide avenue of Noble Way at a right angle, heading east to west.  A thick, sturdy sign stands just off to the side of a charming path, its large friendly letters intent on luring travelers into the city's premiere roadstay, the Gilded Lion Inn. The entrance is clearly marked and welcoming, extending off to the southeast.  A wooden sign and a street lantern are here.

Majestic elms continue to line this broad roadway, sheltering the avenue on both sides and further enhancing the grandiose atmosphere. Fronting the beautiful homes, cobbled paths edged with narrow flower beds meander through nearby private gardens. Though they appear wonderful places to spend an afternoon or take a picnic, the glances from those tending the estates makes it clear they are only for the invited.  A street lantern is here.

The occasional locked gate marks the entrance to some of the more hidden estates of Spurs nobility. From this broad avenue, little can be seen of their splendor. Behind the imposing gate recedes a proud drive, disappearing mysteriously into the trees. If not for the large imposing tower rising above the hedges it would be hard to discern anything was beyond the gate. It is apparent the residents do not wish to be disturbed.  A street lantern, a closed morbius door, and an open black iron gate are here.

A well-guarded gateway separates the city's residential district from the farmlands just beyond. Guards carefully eye all that enter or exit the city, beckoning gruffly to random travelers for a closer inspection. The structure of the guards' barracks is visible above the road to the west. A weathered wooden sign is posted by the gate.  An open stone gate, a wooden sign, an open thick stone door, and a street lantern are here.

Through the gate lies the city of Spur, the major center of trade and civilization on the plains. The dusty road leading through the gates is well traveled, and walls of the city are in good repair. A small shack sits to the west of the road, during most times of the day a dusty coach can be seen waiting in front, its horses stomping with impatience to be gone. To the right of the door is a small window, its opening covered with metal bars. An old man, missing most of his teeth, waits patiently for the travelers to pay their fare, and then directs them into the waiting area. On the east side of the road a billowing multicolored tent has been erected, the hustle and bustle of merchants and customers can be seen coming and going at all times of the day.  An open iron gate and a rainbow silk tent are here.

Set within a wide tunnel leading through the hedge to the north is the Wilderness Gate. It separates the settled lands of Spur from the open plains to the south of the city. The plains stretch as far as the eyes can see, the horizon and the walls of the fort down the road the only blemishes of the grassy landscape in the distance. The stones of the road are smoothly set together, well built to withstand heavy travel.

The stone paved tradeway stretches across the open plains, interrupting nature's task of consuming the land. An endless sea of grass surrounds you, lapping at the road much like the tides against a beach. The faintly damp wind occasionally blowing in from the west smells of earth.

Only the well-built, stone tradeway gives any hint of civilization ever having had any presence here. The tall grasses limit visibility nearby, hiding any wildlife that may be waiting for prey to stumble too close. A few blades of grass sway slightly in the breeze, some of them broken by the passing of something heavy over them. One of the larger stones in the road, broken loose from its mortar, waits patiently to be repaired.

The tradeway sinks a little lower as it gets closer to the river off to the west. A ditch runs alongside the river's side of the road, small puddles of water filling the bottom. Trickles filter into the puddles from the grass beyond as mosquitoes dart across the muddy surfaces.

Within the heart of this proud fort one can see all around that the reconstruction of its buildings has begun. Large stones and logs have been stacked and piled, while some workers tirelessly attempt to repair the damage that occurred here during the Lords of Chaos wars. The buildings and homes of the people that resided here are slowly taking shape, though, far from completed. The smell of dyes, used to paint the town, permeate the area.

What was once a very well used trade route has slowed to some caravans bringing supplies for the townsmen and the occasional merchants traveling from the far southern reaches of the land. Many guards protect this section of the fort as it is home to some wild beasts that live outside these walls.

As the water overflows the pool, it spills across the sides of the stone to trickle down the steps of the rock formation. Smaller pools are formed as it cascades over the rock until at last the rivulets are reunited into a single small stream which finds its way home to the larger river. Delicate flowering moss has grown over the stones of this centerpiece of the forest, and a small family of larks takes delight in bathing beneath the tiny waterfalls and mossy pools, even as the melodic chirping of other birds wafts through the tree branches all around.

Far above the forest floor, the looming trees' canopy shades the park's paths. Every few feet a break in the leaves lights a fortunate fern or clover patch that languishes in the gift from the heavens. A giant among oaks, dwarfed by the mighty conifers enjoys such a boon.  Its twisted branches decry the battle to survive beneath the taller competitors. Nestled in the crotches of the oak branches, beautiful orchids thrive and bloom despite the weather, causing many of the villagers to believe that the goddess herself has adopted the oak as one of her protected monuments. The villagers have placed benches made of koy around the oak that complement the park without detracting from its natural beauty.  An ancient gnarled oak tree, some fragrant amber orchids, a beautiful hand-carved koy wood bench, a stack of rocks, and an ivy covered sandstone arch are here.

Under the canopy of the huge trees, the cooling peace of the forest mists continues to caress the earth amongst the sweeping fern leaves. Two immense redwood trees, grandfathers to their smaller brethren, stand as silent guardians at the entrance to a natural park. The giants are marked by great rents from limbs lost in mighty winds and scars from both fire and mortal carelessness; yet the ancient trees bear these scars like honored badges, a testament to the vast history of this forest. The limbs of the grandfather conifers cross in a beautiful but simple arch over the path between the trees leading into the park.  A pair of tall ancient redwood trees, a closed wrought iron gate, and a stack of rocks are here.

A soothing peace has settled over the forest here at the center of the park, where the mists coalesce and then dance back out again amongst the trees. Many small rivulets of water feed into an indent atop a large collection of boulders. As the water overflows the pool, it spills across the sides of the stone to trickle down the steps of the rock formation. Smaller pools are formed as it cascades over the rock until at last the rivulets are reunited into a single small stream which finds its way home to the larger river. Delicate flowering moss has grown over the stones of this centerpiece of the forest, and a small family of larks takes delight in bathing beneath the tiny waterfalls and mossy pools, even as the melodic chirping of other birds wafts through the tree branches all around.  A stack of rocks and a closed door are here.

The multi-tiered fountain flows with pure, clean springwater and provides seating around its broad base.  The towering trees surround the village, enclosing the square in a living frame.  To the west is a sturdy building with its door perpetually ajar. A line of Leuian children trots off towards the north, bearing their lessons.

An immense, smoothed river boulder deposited by the river, eons ago, is imbedded in the soft loam of the forest floor and blocks the view of the river to the north. A few giant trees have grown bent around its rounded shape and an innovative homeowner has taken advantage of the resulting shelter. Built carefully among the trees in the lee of the rock, stands a magnificent example of the same peaked wooden beam homes that dot the entire forest.

The playful melodies of Leuian children's tunes dance about the air as the shops and homes here take on a more whimsical atmosphere. Leuian khits strain away from their parents' arms to press eager faces against the storefront glass and gaze at the displays of toys and sweets with wonder filled eyes. A Leuian confectioner smiles as he takes a piece of taffy off the top of his candy house display and shares it with the delighted child. Across the street, a wide bay window display is filled with every kind and color of spinning top.

The houses grow more abundant as the path meanders further around the park. Rows of homes border the park and stretch back amongst the low hills towards the inner part of the island. The light is brighter here, as the canopy of trees thins to allow an expanse of sky to open directly over the middle of the village. Two Leuian adolescents chat and laugh amongst themselves as they casually stroll down the path to the pier, kicking a stone between them.  Some sandy wooden steps are here.

The bark path skirts the lagoon here and connects the docks to the rest of the village. A few bright wildflowers decorate the edge and dance in the light breeze. Weary sailors amble up the road after returning from a long voyage with their duffels thrown over their backs. Further down the road, the lighthouse is barely visible along the shoreline. Although difficult to see from here, its light shines like a beacon of hope to all the river. A giggling band of khits rushes towards the pier in hopes of catching a glimpse of some of the noble ships docked there. A group of Leuians sits near a few large rocks by the docks, mending nets and singing songs with one another another as they wave to the returning fleets.

The thick, tarred pylons of a long wooden pier poke through the surface of the calm lagoon interrupting the flat, mirrored reflection of the wharf storefronts and dry-docked ships. Here, the wheel hits the rub where the fleets converge, merchant ships load and unload, and individuals fish or relax. There are dozens of tables for display of wares awaiting the return of the fishing fleet. Behind each table lies a workspace open to a gully below for the disposal of scraps, where gulls and terns scavenge for tasty tid-bits. Several long shoremen await the lowering of the gangplank of another vessel with empty carts and drays. The stiff breeze off the river invigorates the hustle of the wharf.

The sturdy oak planks of the pier creak harmoniously with every wave and every footfall. A young Leuian sitting over to one side of the pier hums quietly as he hangs another fish on his stringer. Two redwood benches that line the thick timber rails are set perfectly to allow a more intimate view of the river and the lighthouse further downriver.  A weathered hand-carved redwood bench, a weathered hand-carved redwood bench, and a large handmade raft are here.

The thick, tarred pylons of a long wooden pier poke through the surface of the calm lagoon interrupting the flat, mirrored reflection of the wharf storefronts and dry-docked ships. Here, the wheel hits the rub where the fleets converge, merchant ships load and unload, and individuals fish or relax. There are dozens of tables for display of wares awaiting the return of the fishing fleet. Behind each table lies a workspace open to a gully below for the disposal of scraps, where gulls and terns scavenge for tasty tid-bits. Several long shoremen await the lowering of the gangplank of another vessel with empty carts and drays. The stiff breeze off the river invigorates the hustle of the wharf.

The bark path skirts the lagoon here and connects the docks to the rest of the village. A few bright wildflowers decorate the edge and dance in the light breeze. Weary sailors amble up the road after returning from a long voyage with their duffels thrown over their backs. Further down the road, the lighthouse is barely visible along the shoreline. Although difficult to see from here, its light shines like a beacon of hope to all the river. A giggling band of khits rushes towards the pier in hopes of catching a glimpse of some of the noble ships docked there. A group of Leuians sits near a few large rocks by the docks, mending nets and singing songs with one another another as they wave to the returning fleets.

The houses grow more abundant as the path meanders further around the park. Rows of homes border the park and stretch back amongst the low hills towards the inner part of the island. The light is brighter here, as the canopy of trees thins to allow an expanse of sky to open directly over the middle of the village. Two Leuian adolescents chat and laugh amongst themselves as they casually stroll down the path to the pier, kicking a stone between them.  Some sandy wooden steps are here.

An immense, smoothed river boulder deposited by the river, eons ago, is imbedded in the soft loam of the forest floor and blocks the view of the river to the north. A few giant trees have grown bent around its rounded shape and an innovative homeowner has taken advantage of the resulting shelter. Built carefully among the trees in the lee of the rock, stands a magnificent example of the same peaked wooden beam homes that dot the entire forest. One fledgling tree pokes its head through a well-planned hole in the roof.  A pair of closed magnificent carved steelwood doors, a slippery downhill path, and a stack of rocks are here.

The chipped bark path widens to encompass a broad square between the peaked roofs of the village homes, the larger storefronts, and several communal buildings that all surround a magnificent fountain crafted from local sandstone. The multi-tiered fountain flows with pure, clean springwater and provides seating around its broad base.  The towering trees surround the village, enclosing the square in a living frame.  To the west is a sturdy building with its door perpetually ajar. A line of Leuian children trots off towards the north, bearing their lessons.

A row of smaller cottages with tiny gardens flanks the path on the western edge of a massive river-smoothed boulder. Cheerfully painted wooden mailboxes sprout from the stone curbs, planted to overflowing with crimson poppies and dark green creeping charley vines. The peaked roofs of the small homes are no less spectacular than those of the larger dwellings. Skillful carvings cover the balustrades that support the roofs, creating beautiful, comfortable porches. The cozy homes are bustling with the busy lives of several families.

Through the gate lies the city of Spur, the major center of trade and civilization on the plains. The dusty road leading through the gates is well traveled, and walls of the city are in good repair. A small shack sits to the west of the road, during most times of the day a dusty coach can be seen waiting in front, its horses stomping with impatience to be gone. To the right of the door is a small window, its opening covered with metal bars. An old man, missing most of his teeth, waits patiently for the travelers to pay their fare, and then directs them into the waiting area. On the east side of the road a billowing multicolored tent has been erected, the hustle and bustle of merchants and customers can be seen coming and going at all times of the day.  An open iron gate and a rainbow silk tent are here.

The occasional locked gate marks the entrance to some of the more hidden estates of Spurs nobility. From this broad avenue, little can be seen of their splendor. Behind the imposing gate recedes a proud drive, disappearing mysteriously into the trees. If not for the large imposing tower rising above the hedges it would be hard to discern anything was beyond the gate. It is apparent the residents do not wish to be disturbed.

The wings of the great vulture spread from the eastern wall to the western wall, the mouth open in a twisted and deranged manner. The remaining smooth walls of the room are covered with intricate carvings depicting Taathian ceremonies. Each carving is flanked by sconces burning black candles. The carvings seem to come to life under the flickering, smoky illumination of the candles. Guttural chanting echoes through the room from a corridor to the north.  An opening in the wall, a giant malevolent obsidian vulture statue, and a large balestone abattoir are here.

The western wall of this small cutout in the obsidian cavern is covered with glossy enameled black shelving from floor to ceiling, books crammed in every nook and cranny available. Covering the remaining walls are paintings and scrawled phrases that bespeak a horror beyond any nightmare. Several diagrams show the anatomy of a handful of different races, others have measurements of evil instruments, and even others step by step instructions in torture. Truly some of the most twisted minds have spent their time adding their thoughts to the dark walls.   Some carved obsidian steps going down are here.

[Tainted Apple Grove.]

Tufts of grass grow in an odd pattern across the ground, their roots frantically attempting to find what little nourishment remains in the soil. Rows of twisted, leafless trees grow in a grossly disfigured manner along the western edge of the area.  What may have, at one time, been a continuation of the southern orchard can now only be described as some sort of aberration. Rising from the center of the area is a pile of obsidian stones; the chaotic aura that emanates from them has tainted the entire area.

Travelers from Rathan to the northwest, and the Trade Route to the south, converge at Spur's west gate. Guards posted on the ground give those seeking to enter the city a cursory once-over. Their lack of interest shows that anyone approaching has already been observed from above for some time. A grate in the ground loosens mud from wagon wheels and hooves before they pass through the gate, helping to keep the streets of Spur fairly clean.

This narrow tunnel through the hedge leads up to the gateway that lets out to the wilderness beyond. Though it used to see heavy traffic from the south, the docks have made this gate largely a place of semi-banishment for the guards.  An open bronze gate is here.

Set within a wide tunnel leading through the hedge to the north is the Wilderness Gate. It separates the settled lands of Spur from the open plains to the south of the city. The plains stretch as far as the eyes can see, the horizon and the walls of the fort down the road the only blemishes of the grassy landscape in the distance. The stones of the road are smoothly set together, well built to withstand heavy travel. A broken wagon wheel, discarded some time ago, covers a spot of nearby grass, weeds trying to climb through the spokes.  An open bronze gate is here.

The tradeway runs across the open grasslands northeast towards the Spur, and southwest towards distant lands and eventually, the coast. The plains to the south and east seem totally indifferent to your existence. Just ahead, a small path moves up a village of huts spread out in a semi-circle. In the center of the village a giant fire pit sits where barbarians who wander through the village can sit around to stay warm.  A worn grassy path is here.

The stone paved tradeway stretches across the open plains, interrupting nature's task of consuming the land. An endless sea of grass surrounds you, lapping at the road much like the tides against a beach. The faintly damp wind occasionally blowing in from the west smells of earth. Some of the stones in the road interlock together to form the crude image of a lion. There is no discerning if it was done on purpose or sheer accident.

Only the well-built, stone tradeway gives any hint of civilization ever having had any presence here. The tall grasses limit visibility nearby, hiding any wildlife that may be waiting for prey to stumble too close. A few blades of grass sway slightly in the breeze, some of them broken by the passing of something heavy over them. One of the larger stones in the road, broken loose from its mortar, waits patiently to be repaired.

The grass rises taller and taller in every direction further limiting view just off the roadside. A second glance reveals that this is the lowest point in a large, shallow depression. The tradeway sinks a little lower as it gets closer to the river off to the west. A ditch runs alongside the river's side of the road, small puddles of water filling the bottom. Trickles filter into the puddles from the grass beyond as mosquitoes dart across the muddy surfaces.

Rising up out of the plains, a large walled fort receives the end of the stone road. The river flows from either side, running through the fort from this angle of view. The vegetation surrounding the tradeway at this point hasrecently, allowing a clear field of vision from the tops of the walls ahead. The stones show little wear from the heavy traffic.

The tradeways path leads directly to the imposing north-eastern gate of a stately fort. Even from this distance, the sounds of commerce and progress ring loudly as the harnesses of trader wagons jingle along the busy roadway and saws buzz noisily.The tradeway is constantly full of traffic going in both directions.

Two guards patrol above the gate, looking you over carefully before giving leave to pass through the heavy wood gate. Thick and long wooden ladders serve up to the guard's posts high in the sky so that they may have some relief from their duties overlooking the land and city. Through the slates of the wooden walkways, you can make out four archers playing a game of cards, weapons at the ready. A whip cracks loudly as a caravan heads out the gate towards Spur.

Within the heart of this proud fort one can see all around that the reconstruction of its buildings has begun. Large stones and logs have been stacked and piled, while some workers tirelessly attempt to repair the damage that occurred here during the Lords of Chaos wars. The buildings and homes of the people that resided here are slowly taking shape, though, far from completed. The smell of dyes, used to paint the town, permeate the area.  A breathtaking shimmering bouquet of moonflowers, an open light blue door, and a glowing wrought iron street lantern are here.

Here a gate leads out of the fort and into the Southern regions. Several children run and play just inside the gate, under the watchful eyes of the guards. What was once a very well used trade route has slowed to some caravans bringing supplies for the townsmen and the occasional merchants traveling from the far southern reaches of the land. Many guards protect this section of the fort as it is home to some wild beasts that live outside these walls. In the distance, you can make out two more guards hunting the frogmen that often try to attack the city and caravans.  An open large sturdy wooden gate and a glowing wrought iron lantern are here.

A few guards do a roving patrol of the area and down to the bridge. They check the caravans before they enter and anyone that looks suspicious they throw into the river. They seem quite wary of anyone coming or going to and from the city. From their appearance it would seem best to stay on their good sides and hope that they are in good moods.  An open large sturdy wooden gate, a stone bridge, and a floating pontoon bridge are here.

Shuddering and shifting under the weight of all but the smallest travelers, this floating bridge plies the churning dark waters of the Darkith with ponderous grace. Thick hand sawed planks are tied together with huge twisted hemp ropes and cushioned with rubber bumpers to ease the constant ebb of the river's flow.  Each tar-coated plank moves independantly of the others, causing serpentine twists in the bridge's original shape.    A floating pontoon bridge and a floating pontoon bridge are here.

Sand, debris, rocks, and finally soil deposited by the Darkith river over thousands of years have piled against a natural rock barrier to create an inter-river island.  The course of the mighty Darkith has altered slightly to accomodate the building bulk of the island and now flows on both sides.  Rapids sluice on the east and west side of this island, filling the air with a damp mist that sits heavily on the countryside.  A floating pontoon bridge is here.

A worn rock cliff-face juts out from the island's hillside, its worn edges descending steeply until it finally dives down into the depths of the river.  The river's current boils angrily against the staunch rocks, working to tear their very existence into pebbles and sand.  A smooth tunnel paved with flat stones and supported by solid wooden beams cuts through the cliff.  A smooth dark stone tunnel, a Hithual crafted oak barrel, and a huge pile of dirt are here.

Under the canopy of the huge trees, the cooling peace of the forest mists continues to caress the earth amongst the sweeping fern leaves. Two immense redwood trees, grandfathers to their smaller brethren, stand as silent guardians at the entrance to a natural park. The giants are marked by great rents from limbs lost in mighty winds and scars from both fire and mortal carelessness; yet the ancient trees bear these scars like honored badges, a testament to the vast history of this forest. The limbs of the grandfather conifers cross in a beautiful but simple arch over the path between the trees leading into the park.  A pair of tall ancient redwood trees, a closed wrought iron gate, and a stack of rocks are here.

Facing the beautiful forest of giant trees are several stately cottages, unique in the carving and design. The eaves are decorated with animal icons, masterfully carved from huge timbers, and the shake roofs are steep and overhanging. Exquisite craftsmanship prevails in the doorjambs, windowsills, and porch railings; each is a design of intricate carving that tells a story. The dwellings are far from gawdy, but instead simplistic in their communal design. A manicured lawn dotted with errant wildflowers fronts each cottage up to the edge of the river rock path.

An immense, smoothed river boulder deposited by the river, eons ago, is imbedded in the soft loam of the forest floor and blocks the view of the river to the north. A few giant trees have grown bent around its rounded shape and an innovative homeowner has taken advantage of the resulting shelter. Built carefully among the trees in the lee of the rock, stands a magnificent example of the same peaked wooden beam homes that dot the entire forest. One fledgling tree pokes its head through a well-planned hole in the roof.  A pair of closed magnificent carved steelwood doors, a slippery downhill path, and a stack of rocks are here.

The chipped bark path widens to encompass a broad square between the peaked roofs of the village homes, the larger storefronts, and several communal buildings that all surround a magnificent fountain crafted from local sandstone. The multi-tiered fountain flows with pure, clean springwater and provides seating around its broad base.  The towering trees surround the village, enclosing the square in a living frame.  To the west is a sturdy building with its door perpetually ajar. A line of Leuian children trots off towards the north, bearing their lessons. The faint ding of nautical bells flows in on the breeze from the northwest.   A flowing gold-flecked sandstone fountain is here.

An immense, smoothed river boulder deposited by the river, eons ago, is imbedded in the soft loam of the forest floor and blocks the view of the river to the north. A few giant trees have grown bent around its rounded shape and an innovative homeowner has taken advantage of the resulting shelter. Built carefully among the trees in the lee of the rock, stands a magnificent example of the same peaked wooden beam homes that dot the entire forest. One fledgling tree pokes its head through a well-planned hole in the roof.  A pair of closed magnificent carved steelwood doors, a slippery downhill path, and a stack of rocks are here.

An immense, smoothed river boulder deposited by the river, eons ago, is imbedded in the soft loam of the forest floor and blocks the view of the river to the north. A few giant trees have grown bent around its rounded shape and an innovative homeowner has taken advantage of the resulting shelter. Built carefully among the trees in the lee of the rock, stands a magnificent example of the same peaked wooden beam homes that dot the entire forest. One fledgling tree pokes its head through a well-planned hole in the roof.  A pair of closed magnificent carved steelwood doors, a slippery downhill path, and a stack of rocks are here.

The playful melodies of Leuian children's tunes dance about the air as the shops and homes here take on a more whimsical atmosphere. Leuian khits strain away from their parents' arms to press eager faces against the storefront glass and gaze at the displays of toys and sweets with wonder filled eyes. A Leuian confectioner smiles as he takes a piece of taffy off the top of his candy house display and shares it with the delighted child. Across the street, a wide bay window display is filled with every kind and color of spinning top.

The chipped bark path widens to encompass a broad square between the peaked roofs of the village homes, the larger storefronts, and several communal buildings that all surround a magnificent fountain crafted from local sandstone. The multi-tiered fountain flows with pure, clean springwater and provides seating around its broad base.  The towering trees surround the village, enclosing the square in a living frame.  To the west is a sturdy building with its door perpetually ajar. A line of Leuian children trots off towards the north, bearing their lessons.

The chipped bark path widens to encompass a broad square between the peaked roofs of the village homes, the larger storefronts, and several communal buildings that all surround a magnificent fountain crafted from local sandstone. The multi-tiered fountain flows with pure, clean springwater and provides seating around its broad base.  The towering trees surround the village, enclosing the square in a living frame.  To the west is a sturdy building with its door perpetually ajar. A line of Leuian children trots off towards the north, bearing their lessons. The faint ding of nautical bells flows in on the breeze from the northwest.   A flowing gold-flecked sandstone fountain is here.

An immense, smoothed river boulder deposited by the river, eons ago, is imbedded in the soft loam of the forest floor and blocks the view of the river to the north. A few giant trees have grown bent around its rounded shape and an innovative homeowner has taken advantage of the resulting shelter. Built carefully among the trees in the lee of the rock, stands a magnificent example of the same peaked wooden beam homes that dot the entire forest. One fledgling tree pokes its head through a well-planned hole in the roof.  A pair of closed magnificent carved steelwood doors, a slippery downhill path, and a stack of rocks are here.

The playful melodies of Leuian children's tunes dance about the air as the shops and homes here take on a more whimsical atmosphere. Leuian khits strain away from their parents' arms to press eager faces against the storefront glass and gaze at the displays of toys and sweets with wonder filled eyes. A Leuian confectioner smiles as he takes a piece of taffy off the top of his candy house display and shares it with the delighted child. Across the street, a wide bay window display is filled with every kind and color of spinning top.

A tall, plain building occupies the west edge of the square. The door remains open, its wood smoothed by the touch of hands and its kick plate, dented and scuffed.

A soothing peace has settled over the forest here at the center of the park, where the mists coalesce and then dance back out again amongst the trees. Many small rivulets of water feed into an indent atop a large collection of boulders. As the water overflows the pool, it spills across the sides of the stone to trickle down the steps of the rock formation. Smaller pools are formed as it cascades over the rock until at last the rivulets are reunited into a single small stream which finds its way home to the larger river. Delicate flowering moss has grown over the stones of this centerpiece of the forest, and a small family of larks takes delight in bathing beneath the tiny waterfalls and mossy pools, even as the melodic chirping of other birds wafts through the tree branches all around.  A stack of rocks and a closed door are here.

Far above the forest floor, the looming trees' canopy shades the park's paths. Every few feet a break in the leaves lights a fortunate fern or clover patch that languishes in the gift from the heavens. A giant among oaks, dwarfed by the mighty conifers enjoys such a boon.  Its twisted branches decry the battle to survive beneath the taller competitors. Nestled in the crotches of the oak branches, beautiful orchids thrive and bloom despite the weather, causing many of the villagers to believe that the goddess herself has adopted the oak as one of her protected monuments. The villagers have placed benches made of koy around the oak that complement the park without detracting from its natural beauty.  An ancient gnarled oak tree, some fragrant amber orchids, a beautiful hand-carved koy wood bench, a stack of rocks, and an ivy covered sandstone arch are here.

Under the canopy of the huge trees, the cooling peace of the forest mists continues to caress the earth amongst the sweeping fern leaves. Two immense redwood trees, grandfathers to their smaller brethren, stand as silent guardians at the entrance to a natural park. The giants are marked by great rents from limbs lost in mighty winds and scars from both fire and mortal carelessness; yet the ancient trees bear these scars like honored badges, a testament to the vast history of this forest. The limbs of the grandfather conifers cross in a beautiful but simple arch over the path between the trees leading into the park.  A pair of tall ancient redwood trees, a closed wrought iron gate, and a stack of rocks are here.

[Meetpoint.]

Here a gate leads out of the fort and into the Southern regions. Several children run and play just inside the gate, under the watchful eyes of the guards. What was once a very well used trade route has slowed to some caravans bringing supplies for the townsmen and the occasional merchants traveling from the far southern reaches of the land. Many guards protect this section of the fort as it is home to some wild beasts that live outside these walls. In the distance, you can make out two more guards hunting the frogmen that often try to attack the city and caravans.  An open large sturdy wooden gate and a glowing wrought iron lantern are here.

[Meetpoint Square.]

Within the heart of this proud fort one can see all around that the reconstruction of its buildings has begun. Large stones and logs have been stacked and piled, while some workers tirelessly attempt to repair the damage that occurred here during the Lords of Chaos wars. The buildings and homes of the people that resided here are slowly taking shape, though, far from completed. The smell of dyes, used to paint the town, permeate the area.  A breathtaking shimmering bouquet of moonflowers, an open light blue door, and a glowing wrought iron street lantern are here.

Two guards patrol above the gate, looking you over carefully before giving leave to pass through the heavy wood gate. Thick and long wooden ladders serve up to the guard's posts high in the sky so that they may have some relief from their duties overlooking the land and city. Through the slates of the wooden walkways, you can make out four archers playing a game of cards, weapons at the ready. A whip cracks loudly as a caravan heads out the gate towards Spur.  An open wooden gate is here.

The tradeways path leads directly to the imposing north-eastern gate of a stately fort. Even from this distance, the sounds of commerce and progress ring loudly as the harnesses of trader wagons jingle along the busy roadway and saws buzz noisily.The tradeway is constantly full of traffic going in both directions.

Rising up out of the plains, a large walled fort receives the end of the stone road. The river flows from either side, running through the fort from this angle of view. The vegetation surrounding the tradeway at this point hasrecently, allowing a clear field of vision from the tops of the walls ahead. The stones show little wear from the heavy traffic.

You see dark, vile water surging below you as you look over the ship's railing. Suddenly, visions of hundreds of contorted faces melt in and out of existence in the murky water. You try with all your might to avert your eyes, but the gruesome spectacle etches itself indelibly in your memory.  A broken mast is here.

The occasional blood-curdling scream shatters the silence as you make your way along the starboard side of the decrepit ship. To your east, you see something take shape over the water. Through the dense fog you make out the outlines of a face. At first it views you with curiosity, then its expression quickly turns to one of anger. It then fades away as quickly as it appeared.

You are overcome by a blast of vile nauseating air as you enter the quarters of Galthain.  The familiar moans that echo throughout the ship are absent here, yet the foreboding atmosphere is even stronger in this area.  A weathered journal, a closed door, and a closed stainless steelwood chest are here.

[The Siren, Hallway]

The dark hall of the Siren gives you a strange surreal feeling.  You hear creaks and growling in the shadows all around you.  A multitude of otherworldly voices whisper your name, urging you further.   A stairway, an open door, an open oak door, an open beautiful glittering gold chest, some gauze bandages, and a short bronze fork are here.

The dark, foul smelling hall abruptly branches out to the east towards the ship's galley and west towards the crew's quarters. Out of the corner of your eye, you see small, thin, worm-like creatures darting in and out of the shadows. An old iron grate lies under your feet. Its lock has long since rusted off.  An open rusted iron grate is here.

The combination of the ghastly moans and the worms slithering across the table make you keep your guard up at all times.  A stairway is here.

[The Siren, Hallway]

The dark hall of the Siren gives you a strange surreal feeling.  You hear creaks and growling in the shadows all around you.  A multitude of otherworldly voices whisper your name, urging you further.   A stairway, an open door, an open oak door, an open beautiful glittering gold chest, some gauze bandages, and a short bronze fork are here.

[The Siren, Captain's Quarters]

You are overcome by a blast of vile nauseating air as you enter the quarters of Galthain.  The familiar moans that echo throughout the ship are absent here, yet the foreboding atmosphere is even stronger in this area.  A weathered journal and an open door are here.

[The Siren, Hallway]

The dark, foul smelling hall abruptly branches out to the east towards the ship's galley and west towards the crew's quarters. Out of the corner of your eye, you see small, thin, worm-like creatures darting in and out of the shadows. An old iron grate lies under your feet. Its lock has long since rusted off.  An open rusted iron grate, a soft white linen hood, a pair of fur-lined cloth mittens, a closed old tattered vellum encyclopedia, and a cold cherry tart are here.

[The Siren, Cell]

A row of rusted shackles adorn the back wall of this small cell.  The constant moans and wails of pain that echo throughout the area give you an idea of what atrocities must have been committed here.  The stench of death is abundant throughout the area.  An open rusted iron grate is here.

[The Siren, Galley]

A large, weathered table stands in the center of the room. To your horror, you see the worm-eaten skeletons of the crew still remain seated as they were before the Siren was cursed to an eternity of roaming the seas. The combination of the ghastly moans and the worms slithering across the table make you keep your guard up at all times.  A stairway is here.

[The Siren, Barracks]

You find yourself in the crew barracks.  A row of makeshift bunks lines each wall of the room.  Angry whispers echo all around you letting you know that you are not welcome here.  Something seems to be rustling under the straw in a bunk to your right, you decide to keep a safe distance.
