The smell of freshly cut lumber fills the large lobby of the newly finished bank.  The roof is a collage of intertwined branches and their leaves from above, with a delicately crafted wooden lattice frame set with glass panels just beneath.  The trunk of the Mother tree serves as the back wall of the bank, with the tellers sitting at booths just in front of it.  Some freshly crafted wooden stairs are here.

The platform has been swept recently, revealing the new boards that have replaced some of the burned ones.  The remains of the old bank to the south have been completely cleared away, leaving just the shell of the old building there.  Intricately crafted stairs lead from the platform to the new building that resides in the upper branches.  An open door and a freshly painted wooden sign are here.

The recently repaired walkway lies clean and clear of the dust and debris that covered it a couple of weeks before.  The branches above house a large building, which was not there before the fire.  The bleakness of the burnt forest below stands as a reminder of recent events.  An oak ladder is here.

New wooden planks fit side by side creating the walkway that extends proudly upon the reconstructed supports. The view of the forest to the northwest is quite panoramic, despite the burnt spikes of trees in the midst. A staircase here seems to have some enchantment, judging by the strange appearance of unicorns, bears and owls on the lower steps. Strange, due to the fact that they don't appear carved, painted, or put there by any hand-made means. It is as if the glyphs grew into the wood itself. Mysterious symbols are scattered throughout the portraits, which shimmer with a golden whisper as they are approached.

This is the main entrance of a Temple of Elindale, the inside walls perfectly smooth with glowing magickal symbols upon the surfaces. The enormity of this tree becomes apparent as one travels up the stairs to the northwest. The air holds a fresh, new ambiance, pleasantly scented with sweet sap and rich, earthly undertones.  Some glowing magickal symbols and a brown oak staircase are here.

Encircling the innards of this tree, these steps coil clock-wise to the top, the entire environment one single living thing. There are no cracks, no signs of building. Tapestries on the wall appear life-like, suspended with no visible attachments.  A breathtaking tapestry is here.

A diminutive niche in the wall provides shelter to a small family of flying squirrels. Just inside sit the young, comfortably settled into the soft bedding the parents have gathered up. A breeze carries their tiny chitters to your ears, revealing that the niche is somehow connected to the outside world as well.  A niche in the wall is here.

[Elindale's Temple.]

A large tapestry lines the outside wall of the passageway, most impressive in that it is not made of fabric, but of vines as tiny as thick hairs, growing in a weave. The delicate shadings of the plants is perfectly natural, and as the eye becomes unfocused, a picture of a diminutive, beautiful maiden sits amongst a foresty background. The wall opposite of this magnificent tapestry is lined with portraits of prominent temple leaders, the colors vibrant, bringing a life-like sense to the frames. The eyes of the maiden in the tapestry seem to follow you, staring directly as you pass, boring into your soul.  A vellum portrait, a canvas portrait, a suede portrait, some unfinished portraits, and a carefully painted silk screen are here.

While the tree appears gigantic from the outside, it still is nothing compared to the impression of being on the inside. Hollow branches large enough to pass a drake branch out here, the surfaces smooth, but in a most curious way. It is apparent that no tools were used to create these passageways, yet there is no evidence to give one the impression that the passageways formed over a long period of time. The branches have grown in this manner intentionally, quite unlike any plantlife found anywhere on the land.

The walls have grown out short, flat surfaces to serve as bookshelves. Small branches spring out of the shelves themselves to provide rests, holding up the many stacks of books collected here. The glory of Elindale can be found, scribed into these pages, as well as other points of interest. Historical novels, books of lore and tomes of knowledge are available for the temple registry to peruse. Any time spent here could prove to teach anyone something they haven't yet learned, or at the very least, one might study the tomes to learn better how to do that which they already know.  An open gilt edged leather book and a smooth oak bookshelf are here.
