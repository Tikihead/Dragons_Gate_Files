You follow Shaleu through a new windy road...

[Winding Uphill Road.]

The steep nature of this cliffside road is made less imposing by the many twists and turns that cut into the rock face wherever they are most needed. A sturdy railing has been built into the rock at the most dangerous turns and carefully carved steps are added off to the side to aid foot traffic and give it a quicker path up the hill if desired.  From this height, the awesome beauty of the island and the long journey of the river surrounding it become clearly visible.  A new windy road is here.

Whether erected strictly for entrepreneurial reasons or as a tribute to the art of carving, a master craftsman has turned one of the lightning struck dead-fall timbers into an impressive sign-post directing all to his place of business as well as the other services available in the village.  Small, discreet arrows point west and southwest with directions written in Leuian.  All available spaces between the directions are filled with exquisite carvings of great antlered deer, growling, shaggy bears, breaching barnacle-backed whales, pointy-eared rabbits, and heavy maned horses, and the noble Leuian warriors among them.  The animals bear no marks of ownership, harness, or muzzle, and none are contained in fences. Displayed on the lower half, a few feet off the ground is a carving of a wolf-size, panting dog enjoying a scratch from the Leuian's hands.  A detailed hand-carved monument and a stack of rocks are here.

Under the canopy of the huge trees, the cooling peace of the forest mists continues to caress the earth amongst the sweeping fern leaves. Two immense redwood trees, grandfathers to their smaller brethren, stand as silent guardians at the entrance to a natural park. The giants are marked by great rents from limbs lost in mighty winds and scars from both fire and mortal carelessness; yet the ancient trees bear these scars like honored badges, a testament to the vast history of this forest. The limbs of the grandfather conifers cross in a beautiful but simple arch over the path between the trees leading into the park.  A pair of tall ancient redwood trees, a closed wrought iron gate, and a stack of rocks are here.

Far above the forest floor, the looming trees' canopy shades the park's paths. Every few feet a break in the leaves lights a fortunate fern or clover patch that languishes in the gift from the heavens. A giant among oaks, dwarfed by the mighty conifers enjoys such a boon.  Its twisted branches decry the battle to survive beneath the taller competitors. Nestled in the crotches of the oak branches, beautiful orchids thrive and bloom despite the weather, causing many of the villagers to believe that the goddess herself has adopted the oak as one of her protected monuments. The villagers have placed benches made of koy around the oak that complement the park without detracting from its natural beauty.  An ancient gnarled oak tree, some fragrant amber orchids, a beautiful hand-carved koy wood bench, a stack of rocks, and an ivy covered sandstone arch are here.

A soothing peace has settled over the forest here at the center of the park, where the mists coalesce and then dance back out again amongst the trees. Many small rivulets of water feed into an indent atop a large collection of boulders. As the water overflows the pool, it spills across the sides of the stone to trickle down the steps of the rock formation. Smaller pools are formed as it cascades over the rock until at last the rivulets are reunited into a single small stream which finds its way home to the larger river. Delicate flowering moss has grown over the stones of this centerpiece of the forest, and a small family of larks takes delight in bathing beneath the tiny waterfalls and mossy pools, even as the melodic chirping of other birds wafts through the tree branches all around.  A stack of rocks and a closed door are here.

An immense, smoothed river boulder deposited by the river, eons ago, is imbedded in the soft loam of the forest floor and blocks the view of the river to the north. A few giant trees have grown bent around its rounded shape and an innovative homeowner has taken advantage of the resulting shelter. Built carefully among the trees in the lee of the rock, stands a magnificent example of the same peaked wooden beam homes that dot the entire forest. One fledgling tree pokes its head through a well-planned hole in the roof.  A pair of closed magnificent carved steelwood doors, a slippery downhill path, and a stack of rocks are here.

Two Leuian adolescents chat and laugh amongst themselves as they casually stroll down the path to the pier, kicking a stone between them.  Some sandy wooden steps are here.

Beyond the embrace of the forest, a warm golden sand beach has gathered in the backflow of a protected cove. Above, fern fronds, vines, and the exposed roots of the giant conifers dangle over the edge of a short steppe that protects the village from floods.  A walkway created by dual rows of pitch torches lead to a large, communal sand pit. Circling the pit are several large logs evenly spaced for those who come to catch the night's events or simply sit and relax.

[Peaceful Eddy.]

A few hundred yards to the north, the Darkith roars by a series of rapids that bypass this serene, peaceful lagoon.  Too small for any boat traffic, the pool is the perfect swimming hole and visited by the villagers regularly.  The water here is home to many large finned fish that hide in the shadows and wait for swimmers to disturb their favorite meals from the shallows.  As testament to the swimming abilities of some, flotation devices abound until higher flood waters clean the eddy out, and the collection of odd items begins anew.     A miniature toy cork duck, a floating yellow life preserver, and a warm golden sand beach are here.

[Protected Cove.]

Beyond the embrace of the forest, a warm golden sand beach has gathered in the backflow of a protected cove. Above, fern fronds, vines, and the exposed roots of the giant conifers dangle over the edge of a short steppe that protects the village from floods.  A walkway created by dual rows of pitch torches lead to a large, communal sand pit. Circling the pit are several large logs evenly spaced for those who come to catch the night's events or simply sit and relax.   Some sandy wooden steps, a cool clear lagoon, and a blazing crackling fire pit are here.

[Village.]

The houses grow more abundant as the path meanders further around the park. Rows of homes border the park and stretch back amongst the low hills towards the inner part of the island. The light is brighter here, as the canopy of trees thins to allow an expanse of sky to open directly over the middle of the village. Two Leuian adolescents chat and laugh amongst themselves as they casually stroll down the path to the pier, kicking a stone between them.  Some sandy wooden steps are here.

The bark path skirts the lagoon here and connects the docks to the rest of the village. A few bright wildflowers decorate the edge and dance in the light breeze. Weary sailors amble up the road after returning from a long voyage with their duffels thrown over their backs. Further down the road, the lighthouse is barely visible along the shoreline. Although difficult to see from here, its light shines like a beacon of hope to all the river. A giggling band of khits rushes towards the pier in hopes of catching a glimpse of some of the noble ships docked there. A group of Leuians sits near a few large rocks by the docks, mending nets and singing songs with one another another as they wave to the returning fleets.

The thick, tarred pylons of a long wooden pier poke through the surface of the calm lagoon interrupting the flat, mirrored reflection of the wharf storefronts and dry-docked ships. Here, the wheel hits the rub where the fleets converge, merchant ships load and unload, and individuals fish or relax. There are dozens of tables for display of wares awaiting the return of the fishing fleet. Behind each table lies a workspace open to a gully below for the disposal of scraps, where gulls and terns scavenge for tasty tid-bits. Several long shoremen await the lowering of the gangplank of another vessel with empty carts and drays. The stiff breeze off the river invigorates the hustle of the wharf.

[End of Pier.]

The sturdy oak planks of the pier creak harmoniously with every wave and every footfall. A young Leuian sitting over to one side of the pier hums quietly as he hangs another fish on his stringer. Two redwood benches that line the thick timber rails are set perfectly to allow a more intimate view of the river and the lighthouse further downriver.  A weathered hand-carved redwood bench and a weathered hand-carved redwood bench are here.

An immense, smoothed river boulder deposited by the river, eons ago, is imbedded in the soft loam of the forest floor and blocks the view of the river to the north. A few giant trees have grown bent around its rounded shape and an innovative homeowner has taken advantage of the resulting shelter. Built carefully among the trees in the lee of the rock, stands a magnificent example of the same peaked wooden beam homes that dot the entire forest. One fledgling tree pokes its head through a well-planned hole in the roof.  A pair of closed magnificent carved steelwood doors, a slippery downhill path, and a stack of rocks are here.

The chipped bark path widens to encompass a broad square between the peaked roofs of the village homes, the larger storefronts, and several communal buildings that all surround a magnificent fountain crafted from local sandstone. The multi-tiered fountain flows with pure, clean springwater and provides seating around its broad base.  The towering trees surround the village, enclosing the square in a living frame.  To the west is a sturdy building with its door perpetually ajar. A line of Leuian children trots off towards the north, bearing their lessons. The faint ding of nautical bells flows in on the breeze from the northwest.   A flowing gold-flecked sandstone fountain is here.

[Hothouse Cottage.]

Flowers of every color in the rainbow greet you as you enter this room. Plants, both potted and wild, are scattered throughout the room, covering the walls and floor with a riot of color and textures. The various fragrances are intoxicatingly strong. A magnificent bed is settled against the south wall of the room covered with a thick red and green velvet patchwork quilt. A warm wool blanket rests across the foot of the bed. The windows are crystal clear, giving a full view of the front of the house and allowing the sunlight to reach every plant.  A small reading desk with a lamp is opposite the bed with scrolls and writing implements scattered across the top. Againstthe west wall is a large glass covered cabinet that displays objects of interest with the crystal clarity of perfectly smooth glass.  An open glass covered cabinet, an open vine etched glass door, and a sparkling clear glass window are here.

Amidst the towering trees and verdant mid level bushes, several smaller cabins blend into the surrounding park.

[Commodore Island Park.]

A grove of young, green-needled pine trees surrounds a small meadow of vibrantly flowering rhododendrons. Hues of bright pink, red, and white create a stunning contrast against the darker grey bark of the pines. Brighter green hemlock trees spread to catch the sunlight, which, in turn, shelter smaller stands of delicious salmonberry bushes, airy leather ferns, and poignantly fragranced sorrels that thrive on the compost of the forest floor. Soft haircap moss covers the river stone-lined path, dew from the mist collecting on it like pollen on bees. The distant wash of rushing water quietly filters through the peaceful air that hangs heavily saturated with moisture.  A stack of rocks is here.

[Commodore Island Park.]

A soothing peace has settled over the forest here at the center of the park, where the mists coalesce and then dance back out again amongst the trees. Many small rivulets of water feed into an indent atop a large collection of boulders. As the water overflows the pool, it spills across the sides of the stone to trickle down the steps of the rock formation. Smaller pools are formed as it cascades over the rock until at last the rivulets are reunited into a single small stream which finds its way home to the larger river. Delicate flowering moss has grown over the stones of this centerpiece of the forest, and a small family of larks takes delight in bathing beneath the tiny waterfalls and mossy pools, even as the melodic chirping of other birds wafts through the tree branches all around.  A stack of rocks and a closed door are here.

The chipped bark path widens to encompass a broad square between the peaked roofs of the village homes, the larger storefronts, and several communal buildings that all surround a magnificent fountain crafted from local sandstone. The multi-tiered fountain flows with pure, clean springwater and provides seating around its broad base.  The towering trees surround the village, enclosing the square in a living frame.  To the west is a sturdy building with its door perpetually ajar. A line of Leuian children trots off towards the north, bearing their lessons. The faint ding of nautical bells flows in on the breeze from the northwest.   A flowing gold-flecked sandstone fountain is here.

The playful melodies of Leuian children's tunes dance about the air as the shops and homes here take on a more whimsical atmosphere. Leuian khits strain away from their parents' arms to press eager faces against the storefront glass and gaze at the displays of toys and sweets with wonder filled eyes. A Leuian confectioner smiles as he takes a piece of taffy off the top of his candy house display and shares it with the delighted child. Across the street, a wide bay window display is filled with every kind and color of spinning top.

[Winding Uphill Road.]

The steep nature of this cliffside road is made less imposing by the many twists and turns that cut into the rock face wherever they are most needed. A sturdy railing has been built into the rock at the most dangerous turns and carefully carved steps are added off to the side to aid foot traffic and give it a quicker path up the hill if desired.  From this height, the awesome beauty of the island and the long journey of the river surrounding it become clearly visible.  A new windy road is here.

Sand, debris, rocks, and finally soil deposited by the Darkith river over thousands of years have piled against a natural rock barrier to create an inter-river island.  The course of the mighty Darkith has altered slightly to accomodate the building bulk of the island and now flows on both sides.  Rapids sluice on the east and west side of this island, filling the air with a damp mist that sits heavily on the countryside.  A floating pontoon bridge is here.

[Darkith River Bridge.]

Shuddering and shifting under the weight of all but the smallest travelers, this floating bridge plies the churning dark waters of the Darkith with ponderous grace. Thick hand sawed planks are tied together with huge twisted hemp ropes and cushioned with rubber bumpers to ease the constant ebb of the river's flow.  Each tar-coated plank moves independantly of the others, causing serpentine twists in the bridge's original shape.    A floating pontoon bridge and a floating pontoon bridge are here.

A few guards do a roving patrol of the area and down to the bridge. They check the caravans before they enter and anyone that looks suspicious they throw into the river. They seem quite wary of anyone coming or going to and from the city. From their appearance it would seem best to stay on their good sides and hope that they are in good moods.

Here a gate leads out of the fort and into the Southern regions. Several children run and play just inside the gate, under the watchful eyes of the guards. What was once a very well used trade route has slowed to some caravans bringing supplies for the townsmen and the occasional merchants traveling from the far southern reaches of the land. Many guards protect this section of the fort as it is home to some wild beasts that live outside these walls. In the distance, you can make out two more guards hunting the frogmen that often try to attack the city and caravans.  An open large sturdy wooden gate and a glowing wrought iron lantern are here.

Within the heart of this proud fort one can see all around that the reconstruction of its buildings has begun. Large stones and logs have been stacked and piled, while some workers tirelessly attempt to repair the damage that occurred here during the Lords of Chaos wars. The buildings and homes of the people that resided here are slowly taking shape, though, far from completed. The smell of dyes, used to paint the town, permeate the area.  A breathtaking shimmering bouquet of moonflowers, an open light blue door, and a glowing wrought iron street lantern are here.

Two guards patrol above the gate, looking you over carefully before giving leave to pass through the heavy wood gate. Thick and long wooden ladders serve up to the guard's posts high in the sky so that they may have some relief from their duties overlooking the land and city. Through the slates of the wooden walkways, you can make out four archers playing a game of cards, weapons at the ready. A whip cracks loudly as a caravan heads out the gate towards Spur.

Rising up out of the plains, a large walled fort receives the end of the stone road. The river flows from either side, running through the fort from this angle of view.

The grass rises taller and taller in every direction further limiting view just off the roadside. A second glance reveals that this is the lowest point in a large, shallow depression.

Trickles filter into the puddles from the grass beyond as mosquitoes dart across the muddy surfaces.

Only the well-built, stone tradeway gives any hint of civilization ever having had any presence here. The tall grasses limit visibility nearby, hiding any wildlife that may be waiting for prey to stumble too close. A few blades of grass sway slightly in the breeze, some of them broken by the passing of something heavy over them. One of the larger stones in the road, broken loose from its mortar, waits patiently to be repaired.

The tradeway runs across the open grasslands northeast towards the Spur, and southwest towards distant lands and eventually, the coast. The plains to the south and east seem totally indifferent to your existence. Just ahead, a small path moves up a village of huts spread out in a semi-circle. In the center of the village a giant fire pit sits where barbarians who wander through the village can sit around to stay warm.  A worn grassy path is here.

[South gate.]

Through the gate lies the city of Spur, the major center of trade and civilization on the plains. The dusty road leading through the gates is well traveled, and walls of the city are in good repair. A small shack sits to the west of the road, during most times of the day a dusty coach can be seen waiting in front, its horses stomping with impatience to be gone. To the right of the door is a small window, its opening covered with metal bars. An old man, missing most of his teeth, waits patiently for the travelers to pay their fare, and then directs them into the waiting area. On the east side of the road a billowing multicolored tent has been erected, the hustle and bustle of merchants and customers can be seen coming and going at all times of the day.  An open iron gate and a rainbow silk tent are here.

A well-guarded gateway separates the city's residential district from the farmlands just beyond. Guards carefully eye all that enter or exit the city, beckoning gruffly to random travelers for a closer inspection. The structure of the guards' barracks is visible above the road to the west. A weathered wooden sign is posted by the gate.  An open stone gate, a wooden sign, an open thick stone door, and a street lantern are here.

[Noble Way.]

The occasional locked gate marks the entrance to some of the more hidden estates of Spurs nobility. From this broad avenue, little can be seen of their splendor. Behind the imposing gate recedes a proud drive, disappearing mysteriously into the trees. If not for the large imposing tower rising above the hedges it would be hard to discern anything was beyond the gate. It is apparent the residents do not wish to be disturbed.  A street lantern, a closed morbius door, and an open black iron gate are here.

Majestic elms continue to line this broad roadway, sheltering the avenue on both sides and further enhancing the grandiose atmosphere. Fronting the beautiful homes, cobbled paths edged with narrow flower beds meander through nearby private gardens. Though they appear wonderful places to spend an afternoon or take a picnic, the glances from those tending the estates makes it clear they are only for the invited.  A street lantern is here.

A small roadway bordered by flowering hedges bisects the wide avenue of Noble Way at a right angle, heading east to west.  A thick, sturdy sign stands just off to the side of a charming path, its large friendly letters intent on luring travelers into the city's premiere roadstay, the Gilded Lion Inn. The entrance is clearly marked and welcoming, extending off to the southeast.  A wooden sign and a street lantern are here.

Numerous trees lining the avenue serve as the dividing border between the majestic estates of the nobility and the lightly traveled roadway.

The boughs of a large apple tree hang over the well tended avenue. Below the beautiful tree stands a small fountain. Atop the fountain is an intricately carved Secian who appears to be dancing with the water as it splashes around her. Set in the marble base is a small plaque that reads, "For those who have gone before us." Many stand for a moment as they pass this way, giving thanks for the gift of life that is given by both the apple tree and the Secians of long ago. Large piles of dirt and broken stone lay on either side of the street as workmen ready the east and west alleys for expansion.  A street lantern, an open Secian etched moonsilver door, a pair of open silver forged swinging doors, and a sign above the doors are here.

Vast estates tower over the huge Spurian wall towards the south. The well-to-do who live in these homes idle away their days, enjoying the luxury of time. Standing next to a very empty lantern pole, a small Flerian child insists in a plaintive wail, that he had nothing to do with the missing lantern. The well-dressed guard that interrogates him keeps pointing at a small sack on the ground and its obvious contents.  An open small burlap sack, a street lantern, and a lantern are here.

No expense has been spared to keep those who travel this road safe from the hoodlums that relish the darkness.  A street lantern and a bloody thief arm are here.

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway.

[Town Square East.]

Travel to the eastern portion of Town Square finds battle clad warriors shoulder to shoulder with chained criminals and those who live outside the Spurian Walls. The cobblestones that line the street are stained with blood.  It is unknown as to whether the blood is from guards carrying out quick executions, or gladiators who refused to wait their turn for arena space.  A street lantern is here.

[Merchant Walk.]

A neatly kept park fronts this portion of Merchant Walk. Topiary and low shrubberies partition off small sections of the park. Young lovers sit on benches almost hidden from view, gazing at each other with looks of love, oblivious to the continual bustle of passing customers and merchants on their way to do business.  A street lantern is here.

[Merchant Walk.]

Merchants, some in frilly finery, others dressed in homespun wools, travel back and forth along this street on their way to and from work. They seem to blend together here, if only briefly. Several of the more haughty looking merchants are trailed by overloaded carts pushed along by haggard young apprentices.   A street lantern is here.

Several city guardsmen have just finished wrestling to the ground some young tough thieves, who thought to rob one of the returning merchants. To one side a relieved-looking Fir Elf gentleman holds on tightly to his gold-tipped walking stick, as the human boy yells his innocence to any who might listen. His pleas fall on deaf ears as the guards drag him away.  A street lantern is here.

[Merchant Walk.]

Merchant Walk comes to an abrupt end at a massive moonsilver gate. The towering walls of Spur on either side of the gates force all to pass by the guards who are constantly on the watch for thieves and bandits. Just beyond the gates one can glimpse the bustling Merchant District of Spur.  A gilded oak sign and a street lantern are here.

[Trade Way.]

A large gate separates the Merchant District and Town Square-the hub of Spur's activity. The partially opened gate is currently able to accommodate the simultaneous passage of several locals and visitors, but can be expanded to accept carriages, or sealed to ward against invasion.  Guards stand sentry from atop the wall as well as the ground.  A street lantern is here.

Many townsfolk pass along this busy thoroughfare. Rich and poor alike mix freely on this street, much to the dismay of a passing nobleman. A young human struggles with an armful of packages and two young children in tow. Those in need of goods or supplies head west towards the market, those looking for the news of the day head east towards Town Square.  A street lantern is here.

The buildings of Market Circle stand to the south. It becomes obvious that the area through the arch is a much cleaner marketplace than the bazaar. An inviting eatery stands beside the road, its door open to those weary after a long trip to Spur, as well as those preparing to venture to the great expanses beyond the west gate. A human couple exit the building, arm in arm. A small sign stands beside the intersection.  A sign, an open glossy lacquered oak door, and a street lantern are here.

The wafting smell of flowers and trees float out from a well kept grey fence.  Old piles of rubble have been cleaned up and the glimpse of a sprawling park can be seen, having been planted in their stead. Beautiful and statuesque monuments dot the landscape through the gate, that remains locked, but has been festively decorated with a bright ribbon.  A street lantern and an open festive ribbon tied grey iron gate are here.

From the city gate to the west, Trade Way continues eastward towards the busy Merchant district, past Joyeusse's Shop. The air is thick with the scent of fresh flowers. Wagons filled with goods bound for sale trundle past, their drivers hopeful of the anticipated profits. Eager young warriors venture towards the west gate and the dangers beyond.

[Gateway.]

The relative safety inside Spur is a comfort to those returning from the fields and mountains. To those leaving, a massive wall of defense around the city lies ahead. Archer towers beside the gate overlook the wall, offering a painful welcome to would-be invaders. Several guards on foot patrol pass and disappear behind a thick, bluesteel banded steelwood door. Wall road stretches to the south, a wide passage between the city wall and several large buildings.  An open iron gate, an open thick stone door, and a street lantern are here.

[Spur Gateway.]

Travelers from Rathan to the northwest, and the Trade Route to the south, converge at Spur's west gate. Guards posted on the ground give those seeking to enter the city a cursory once-over. Their lack of interest shows that anyone approaching has already been observed from above for some time. A grate in the ground loosens mud from wagon wheels and hooves before they pass through the gate, helping to keep the streets of Spur fairly clean.  An open giant black iron gate, a giant green oak tree, a small blue pool, a thick oak grate over the pool, and a polished stone marker are here.

The path is flanked by countless tall oaks, swaying peacefully in the wind. They do their best to hide the sky from view, making it hard to tell night from day at times. Littering the area are pieces of broken wagon, bits of human remains and dried splotches of blood. The remnants of a violent fight lie all around you, whomever used to belong to the wagon is no more than vulture food.  A bloody severed foot is here.

In the dusty distance, Spur's great wall demarks the southern end of this well-traveled merchant's road. Soaring majestically to the north stands the spiky pinnacles and snow topped peaks of an epic mountain range so immense that it separates lands, races, and cultures. Connecting the two is a merchant road built long ago.

The noise and sputum of the big city stains the south eastern horizon through the vague outline of old-growth oaks, maples and cedars. This well traveled road transverses the flat terrain shouldered by weeds and vines and, due to the proximity of the city, small paths continuously cut through the road from either side.

Lush grass grows up to the borders of a thick, dense forest that cloaks the hills to the west. The grasslands thin near the grove as the huge trees completely shade the ground, and are replaced by taller bushes and juniper trees. The contrast between the waving stalks on the flat vista and the dark leaves of almost vertical trees is striking.

From the west spans a dark green forest of Sycamore and Beech trees that soak in the moister parts of the lower river valley. The tall, shaded forest breaks like a green tinged wave upon the tranquil calm of the grasslands. The huge trees within are ancient, reaching hundreds of feet into the air. As if steaming from a great cauldron, a heavy ground fog seeps from deep within the forest carrying with it the fresh smell of decomposing green matter.

A rickety criss-crossed rough beam fence pens the grazing of black and white cows whose ponderous forms are barely visible through the tall grass on either side of the road. To the north, the soft, undulating grassland floor of the wide valley succumbs to the rolling foothills, which in turn delineates the imposing outline of a vista-spanning mountain range. Many a traveler has witnessed this idyllic vantage point and has been drawn on to follow the road that travels into the heart of the mountains.

The road diverts around a small pool of murky water that lies to the north. A confusion of hoof prints muddies the shoreline where the placid bovines have come to water themselves. The pool is damned by a small hillock which allows no drainage so the pool remains stagnant. The mountains to the north reflect in perfectly upside-down symmetry on the still pond's surface, only wavering slightly in concentric circles to the deft touch of small insects.

The travel-worn road dips and curves around the low lying foothills. Each pass over the top of hillsides presents a new view of the mountain range. Each dip into small valleys reveal minute eco-systems that exist in each wagon wheel rut where water collects. Splayed avion tracks dot the dried mud in random order permanently recording the hunters conquest of lesser things from the mud and moss.

Aged and splintered into the vague circular shape, a decaying wagon wheel is left to rot in the grass by the roadside. Their roots protectively sheltered from the weather, idiosyntric sprouts of taller grasses thrive haphazardly inside the wheel. Several tiny holes top small pyramids of sandy debris, where a few red fire ants scout their wagon-wheel domain for fodder.

As the road bends around a curve, ruts left by merchant's wagons cut so deeply into the mud that all wheeled vehicles are forced to follow the set path. Four loaded wagons of a merchants caravan stand idle as one larger than standard wagon skitters along the path. The buckboard's frame groans and strains to keep it inline while the driver attempts to negotiate the turn. Four dark maned, matched mules balk at the noise behind them, and stomp nervously over the deep ruts. The liveried caravan guards attempt to haul the mules forward, further adding to the mules stubborn refusal to move.

The road charges across a flat valley through waving stalks of grain with coppery tinted seeds. Around the northern edge grows a row of huge cypress trees with trunks that measure eight feet across. Debris from the trees' self-trimming mats the taller grasses into an impenetrable wall. The cypresses produce the necessary windbreak for the field to bear the heavy headed grain.

Broadening to fill the lee of a wide valley, the roadway passes by several temporary campsites where caravans have bolstered the existing comforts for their temporary encampments. Neat stacks of foraged sticks and axe-hewn firewood sit adjacent to the blackened rocks of two impromptu fire rings. Freshly dug midden pits waft clues to the camp's frequent use into the clean mountain air.

Empty wooden crates, broken harnesses, damaged pottery, and the usual byproducts of food preparation fill an impromptu refuse pile adjacent to two campsites. Both two and four legged scavengers ply through the pile, scattering it further and enlarging the boundary. The result is a landmark of incongruous shapes, colors and shadows along the otherwise bland sweep of grasslands through which the roadway travels.

Just to the north, the roadway curves gently around a bend in a large river that flows towards the southeast. An enormous smooth round rock splits off a small eddy from the main current resulting a deep, clear pool by the eastern side of the road. The cool calm water catches the reflection of the white snowcapped mountain range further up the valley while the river rushes past towards Spur. Five fishermen recline on folding chairs or against rocks, tethered by the silvery lines of their poles to the fishing hole. Each fisherman is spread evenly around the pool as if held apart by some invisible barrier as they eye the large shadowy fish shapes finning effortlessly against the mild current in the eddy.

The river surges strongly below the stone span. Even from this height, the noise of the flowing water is near deafening. Two small fishing boats nearly collide as they try to tack between the same set of supports. Only skillful sailing prevents them from hitting each other, or the supports.

Mismatched mortar colors and varying types and cuts of the stone show the extent of the reconstruction made by quick working masons. A few proud workers chiseled their initials and the date into their handiwork, most reading the date of Rinannimas, 6th month, 61st day, year 313. Bright banners flutter in the breeze on both sides of the bridge as if in celebration of its victory over both the river's truculence and sabotage.

A massive stone bridge spans a raging grey tinted river as it runs it's course towards the southeast. The mud around the bridge footings has been churned by wheels of quarry wagons, tracks of sleds bearing block and tackle, shod hooves of draft beasts and booted feet of masons and bridge workers. The newer parts of the huge bridge are obvious due to the contrast in colors of mortar and rock. Bright banners snap briskly in the wind from both ends of the bridge.  A broken wooden wagon is here.

Withstanding seasonal floods and constant traffic, the durable road shows how affective good design and competent construction can be. It travels a hand paved berm straight to an imposing grey stone bridge to the southeast. The pilons of the bridge are cloaked in river mist as the raging river sweeps by. Only the brightness of the fluttering flags that top the spans stand out sharply.

A brown and white osprey soars above the raging river, scanning the water for a meal. Suddenly, it dives down to the surface and snatches a rather large trout from the water. The trout wriggles helplessly in the large birds grip as it is carried off to a nest of sticks and twigs high in the distant treetops.

On the northern edge of the road stands a tall, flat rock. Chipped into the shape of a pillar and abraded to smoothness, it bears the stamped surveyor's mark of the road's builder. The mark's grooved letters are filled with sand and dust and obscured from age, but the arrows delineating north, south, east and west are clear and easy to read. The rest of the stamp is undecipherable and lends mystery to the road's origin.

Boulders stacked in pyramids contained by large timbers stand mutely to the side of the roadway next to an impromptu dump of broken tools, wooden stakes and empty buckets lined with mortar. Deeply grooved sled tracks lead to the east towards the bridge from this part of the road where the flatness of the valley was best suited for the staging area during the bridge's reconstruction. Smooth rectangles of tent foundations still mark their location in a semi circle around a blackened fire ring where the workers and their supervisors lived during it's rebuilding.

The decaying remains of the bridge workers camp sprawls across this flat valley. To house their draft beasts, the workers constructed small stalls and shelters from rickety boards nailed quixotically to the standing trees. Three brass ring topped posts lie sunk into the grasslands turf, to the south, which was most likely used for tethering grazing animals. Between the posts is a rough stone trough that is filled automatically with water by a rickety mechanical wind mill, whirling lazily in the breeze.

Water loving trees hug the river's course through the low lying valley. Giant beech and huge alders vie for the valuable sodden shoreline and shade the understory bushes and ferns from direct sunlight. The result is a lushly green, verdant forest that obscures the river from the view on the road, though the hiss of rushing water reveals it's course.

Running parallel to the road is a smooth rock lined trench that channels the road's run-off during rainstorms. This flat part of the road that follows the valley floor would be prone to turn into a muddy bog and therefore a hazard to most caravans and their pack animals. Anticipating this event, the road's engineers built drains into the lower side of the road that carry the runoff into the culvert, which carries it harmlessly down to the low end of the valley.

The roadway takes advantage of a cut in the hill to negotiate a tumbled cliff face. At the top of the hill is a high, flat, steppe grassland, and at the bottom is the edge of the open range. At one point, the road narrows to cross a small stream. Very little mud gathers in the shallows of the stream and the pebbles and rocks glitter like gold as the wagon wheels churn the gravel.

Much higher up the great mountainsides a line where trees stop growing gives testament to the altitude. The air is cool.

The grassland plateau is embraced by a stand of dark green oak trees so thick that little light passes through the profusion of their many lobed leaves. The forest is ancient and the trunks of the trees bare witness to fires, lightning strikes and the attacks of insects.

The merchant road follows a bumpy path through the oak forest. Each stately old tree has added a few feet to it's girth since the road was first surveyed and constructed hundreds of years ago. Their roots have plied across the road, upending it's hand laid foundation and hand pounded bed. Several large knees of the oak's roots have leveraged up the edges of the road, hindering all wagons' passage and threatening to break spokes and axles.

Dead fall and broken branches cover the hollow and is home for a family of thick furred marmots.

A brace of buck-toothed, adolescent marmots scramble for cover as the shrill cry of a hawk sounds further up the mountain.

Thicker stalked grasses grow here on this high plateau where the air is rarified and rain spills quickly down the small rocky gullies. A few staunch oaks grow alone or in groups of one or two, their roots exposed where they cling to the rocky soil for sustenance. Thin, scraggly junipers suck up what little moisture the soil does manage to hold. The merchant road placidly passes by, untouched by time in the dry environment.

Bright green trees and healthy bushes stand out sporadically on the dusty steppe. The little spring fed islands are surrounded by the blue-green grasses that thrive here. All manner of beasts are drawn to the springs and the protection they offer. Bright blue scrub jays chatter noisily among themselves as they dart and swerve in accomplished aerial feats pursuing their winged insect meals. A small herd of wary jackrabbits stop munching the grass to turn their white ears towards the merchant road. The nearest jack to the road stands on his hind legs and tests the air for any scent of their many predators.

Blending perfectly with the muted hues of the arid surroundings, a lone timber wolf stalks the outer edges of the grassland about a half a mile from the merchant road. The wolf's ears are perked to listen for the rustling of the bushy tailed jack rabbits that thrive in the prairie. The wolf lifts it nose to catch a scent, howls briefly and trots off towards the southeast to catch it's prey from downwind.

A brisk wind barrels down from the mountains to the north, its touch filled with the promise of ice and snow. As it passes the dry road-bed, it mixes with the warm moist air of the river valley that creeps north and causes dust dervishes that spin their opaque bodies thousands of feet into the air. The sharp bladed grasses shiver and swirl as the tiny twisters weave their way across the steppe.

The merchant road tops a low swell in the dusty green grass ocean of the dry steppe. From here, it is possible to observe an astounding 360 degree vista of the towering mountains to the north, the thick oak forest to the southeast, and more dry grasslands to the south and west. The terrain buckles and bends towards the north like a giant rug of trees and rocks had been pushed towards a wall of solid rock.

The merchant road takes a turn around a large, scraggy rock formation. To the northeast, the tall hills provide an ample wind break and here a small pine forest thrives.  A moss-banked stream meanders slowly down the center of the small hidden vale. To the south, the road tops a the long hill to a particularly good vantage point.

Tall, rough barked pine trees dominate the canyon floor as far as the eye can see. The vaulting slender trees compete for the sunlight high above the forest floor, leaving great visibility throughout the valley. At the south end of the hidden vale, the slow stream runs muddy as it snakes and loops around some of the older trees. Towards the north is an unnatural grouping of low lying mud domes.

Each incline and decline in the road is fixed to an agreeable grade for most wagons and sleds.

The merchant road cuts straight through a hill where men and beasts must have toiled to remove tons of blasted rock and dirt. The choice to remove hundreds of feet of hillside was more prudent to the road engineers then a long series of switch-backs that would have to climb the steep hillside for hundreds of feet. Tube shaped holes drilled into the bedrock still remain from when the roadbed was blasted eons ago.

The merchant road threads through bottom of the small, narrow valley. Sheer granite walls block the view from the well traveled road to either side and above, only a narrow ray of sky testifies to the time of day. The engineers set a route as far as possible from the broken stones in the center of the valley and, by luck or design, this foresight has saved the road-bed from constant reconstruction. Small cracks run parallel to the road, but none have broken through the thick layers of sand and stone.

One layer of rock in the steep walls has eroded faster then the harder granite or bedrock above and below it. Soft sandstone has been stripped away to form an arch in the valley wall ... a concave indention that goes for hundreds of feet in both directions.

The momentous forces that have wrought this valley still press upon the land and have done so for eons.

As if in testimony to the power of the forces that move the land, a huge dark boulder sits off to the side of the road. It is hewn in half like a sliced melon.  One part sits 20 feet north along the break in the rocks from the other part.

The fault line of broken rocks continues its path of destruction to the west, skirted by the land-slide prone softer dirt.   A freshly uncovered crevice is here.

The old merchant road lies in pieces at the bottom of a deep gorge far below. An artificial pathway has been constructed in the wake of the recent collapse, allowing continued passage through the mountains. This new merchant road has been constructed in great haste and is still quite unstable. Gravel that has been spread on the road to make it safer, is actually making it far more precarious. Pebbles roll continuously off of the roads surface and down into the chasm below.

Two picturesque snow-capped mountain peaks come together in the distance for a lower pass through their forested bases. The white glint of a distant waterfall glistens amongst the green backdrop. The granite road below you continues its precarious trek eastward up the cliffside.

Despite the fact the cliffs to the north are nearly vertical, various plants still cling to life against them. Many are common weeds or merely grasses, but some are delicate wildflowers, leaving little or no explanation as to their presence on the cliff. One small tree is also attempting to take root along the cliffside, its branches jutting out at odd angles.  An oddly shaped rosewood tree is here.

The cliff face to the north is slightly more sloped than others, allowing far more vegetation to grow on it. Small shapes are visible scurrying about among the grasses and shrubs, most of them reacting to any movement on the road. A few are visible up the road ahead, but quickly vanish at the distant screech of a raptor. It is a few moments before they curiously return.  Some small cute striped chipmunks are here.

The poor construction of this road becomes quickly evident. Water is flowing down over the sides of the cliff above and across the road surface. Due to the slight slope of the road toward the deep chasm to the south, this section of road is quite hazardous. Many broken pieces of rope and metal spikes are strewn all over the pathway; evidently failed attempts to keep wagons from sliding over the side. Large piles of heavy looking stones have now been stacked along the edge of the gorge in hopes it will prevent trade carts from careening off the edge. Several of these stones seem to be missing. Evidently the idea is not working as well as was hoped.  A large pile of stones and a large pile of stones are here.

A large pile of unexplained wooden crates and barrels have been tossed unceremoniously in an alcove off the side of the main road. They have all been scavenged long ago and simply lie abandoned by their owners. For hundreds of feet in either direction, the road surface is covered in deep grooves, making wagon travel quite hazardous. Even at a slow pace the vibrations are intense enough to damage cargo. This is made evident as a heavily laden wagon shudders down the slope. Swearing loudly, the merchant tosses what sounds like a crate full of broken glass into the alcove before continuing onward.  A pile of wooden crates and barrels is here.

A large gap in the roadway is now spanned by a rickety looking wood and rope bridge. The slats seem to be spaced just close enough so that a wagon wheel does not get lodged between them. The remnants of the foundations of an old stone bridge are evident on both sides of this gap. A few hundred feet below the present bridge, the former one is visible in several pieces. Considering the state of the old bridge, this unstable replacement does not exactly inspire feelings of safety.  A decrepit looking wood and rope bridge is here.

Several large cracks split the roads surface at odd angles, threatening to swallow unwary travelers. Large and very unsteady wooden boards have been placed across the gaps, creating makeshift bridges. Many of the boards have a significant curve to them, suggesting that they may have been the victim of a rather large traveler.

A large pile of animal carcasses in various stages of decay is situated on a precarious ledge halfway up the cliff face. Bloody footprints from some sort of predatory animal are plainly visible along the edge of the path, providing a bit of insight into the decaying animal remains. The road reaches the top of the cliff up the gentle slope to the east.  Some greying oak planks are here.

There is an extremely large crevasse in the roadway that would normally prevent any further travel along this road. Astoundingly, someone has constructed a very sturdy looking bridge using two perfectly chiseled granite blocks. The blocks make up the support for the bridge structure, which is also constructed of chiseled granite slabs. There is seemingly no explanation for the excellent condition of this stretch of the road.  A sturdy granite bridge is here.

The cliff face to the north is wet, but there is no apparent source of the moisture. A slight overhang also creates a near permanent shadow in the area, providing a perfect atmosphere for the dense lichen that covers the rocks. Sporadic tufts of grass futilely attempt to assert themselves against the multi-colored lichen, but the spongy fungus prevails. Strange looking spiders scurry about amongst the lichen-covered rocks, before disappearing over the top of the cliff.

Small low-lying bushes with bright red berries dominate this stretch of the road. Many birds of various sizes and colors hop from bush to bush, chirping pleasantly as they feast upon the berries.

A large number of horses, carts, and merchants are congregated off the side of the road. They are either preparing for the journey down the cliff to the southwest, or are resting from the trip in the opposite direction. A dangerously high cliff is visible to the south, while to the east a flat plateau leads the roadway between two large mountains. The green hue of a forest is just visible between them.

The road is almost non-existent. The many large granite boulders that cover the path evidence the instability of the mountains to the north and south. The merchants who travel this road have erected a series of shoddy road signs to direct travelers safely around the boulders. Several of these signs point away from a shadowy area just off the side of the road. The rocks of the area seem to hang over the road slightly, blocking out the light. Light colored stringy material is barely visible along the side of the path.  A flimsy wooden sign, a flimsy wooden sign, and a craggy overhang are here.

The swollen body of a small spider-like creature lies on the ground. The abdomen looks like it was torn apart from within, and the legs have been chewed to pieces. Considering that the mutilated body is as hard as a rock, the scene attests forcefully to the strength of the spiders' jaws.

Sparkling webbing holds the carcass of a large cave bat against the cavern wall. The body of the flying mammal is emaciated, drained of all fluids and internal organs. The abdomen is grossly swollen and alive with movement.

Minute webs cover the entrances to several recesses in the pitted lava wall. Though the sticky traps can't be more than a hand's width wide, the craftmanship of each web is sheer perfection.

A crazy-eyed Hithual lies on the ground with his legs folded up to his chin. His long, dredded beard flows down well past his knees, and has clearly not been tended to in a long time. His stench assails your nose, and you can only surmise that it's the very thing keeping predators from devouring him. Aside from a tiny sob that escapes his lips as you walk by, he doesn't acknowledge your presence at all.

The cavern wall is dense with a moving blackness.  When it is approached, several large bats scurry up the heavily pitted wall, their clawed feet moving with surprising agility.  While most are simply resting, there are quite a few busy cleaning themselves with long, crimson tongues.  The faces of the bats glow with an eerie purple hue, much like the fungus found in the cavern.

The immense cavern you're in is surprisingly bright. Light reflects and refracts off the facets of the ubiquitous crystals. Everywhere you look, there are crystals - growing on cavern walls, up and down the floor, even off each other.

This area is not illuminated.
You see the 1st turquoise crystalline spider corpse, the 2nd turquoise crystalline spider, the 1st sleek black panther (wearing a small gold collar), and the 1st matron crystalline spider.
In the area are September the Noble Leuian, Kandil the Leuian, Hott the Noble Leuian, Kenetic the Leuian, Castallion the Novice Leuian, Shaleu the Leuian, and Audun the Noble Leuian.
Obvious paths: north east southeast south southwest west northwest.

You follow Kandil through a hole in the web...

[Winding Tunnel]

The tunnel is blocked by an immense network of crystalline webbing. The webbing twinkles like morning dewdrops on flower petals. A closer look reveals several items deep within the webbing, some of which look like bones. A hole at the bottom of the web provides the only way forward.  A hole in the web is here.

The tunnel forks here, but one of the paths is blocked by a stack of flat stones. The stones are pitted, as if something has actually eaten through the rock. Some even have holes through their centers. As you take a closer look at the stones, a scraping noise above you draws your attention.  A pile of pitted stones is here.

Burned out remnants of torches adorn the walls. While this tunnel may have been inhabited at one time, it appears long deserted now. Only the slowly dripping water breaks the silence. The ground starts to slope slowly downward.  Some blackened lemonwood torches and a narrow opening are here.

You follow Kandil through a path...

[Tarath Bends.]

The road is almost non-existent. The many large granite boulders that cover the path evidence the instability of the mountains to the north and south. The merchants who travel this road have erected a series of shoddy road signs to direct travelers safely around the boulders. Several of these signs point away from a shadowy area just off the side of the road. The rocks of the area seem to hang over the road slightly, blocking out the light. Light colored stringy material is barely visible along the side of the path.  A flimsy wooden sign, a flimsy wooden sign, and a craggy overhang are here.

A large number of horses, carts, and merchants are congregated off the side of the road. They are either preparing for the journey down the cliff to the southwest, or are resting from the trip in the opposite direction. A dangerously high cliff is visible to the south, while to the east a flat plateau leads the roadway between two large mountains. The green hue of a forest is just visible between them.

The merchant road ascends slightly to the east as it travels between two mountain peaks. Up the slopes to the north and south is a dense forest with massive red barked trees. Closer to the path, the forest begins to thin out and only a few trees have established themselves close to the road. The merchants who made this road did not bother to go around one of the largest, which is situated directly in the middle of the path.  An ancient towering rosewood tree is here.

Small low-lying bushes with bright red berries dominate this stretch of the road. Many birds of various sizes and colors hop from bush to bush, chirping pleasantly as they feast upon the berries. Just to the northeast, the road ascends over the top of the cliff and out of sight. To the west, most of the merchant road is discernible following along the precarious cliff face.

The cliff face to the north is wet, but there is no apparent source of the moisture. A slight overhang also creates a near permanent shadow in the area, providing a perfect atmosphere for the dense lichen that covers the rocks. Sporadic tufts of grass futilely attempt to assert themselves against the multi-colored lichen, but the spongy fungus prevails. Strange looking spiders scurry about amongst the lichen-covered rocks, before disappearing over the top of the cliff.

There is an extremely large crevasse in the roadway that would normally prevent any further travel along this road. Astoundingly, someone has constructed a very sturdy looking bridge using two perfectly chiseled granite blocks. The blocks make up the support for the bridge structure, which is also constructed of chiseled granite slabs. There is seemingly no explanation for the excellent condition of this stretch of the road.  A sturdy granite bridge is here.

A large pile of animal carcasses in various stages of decay is situated on a precarious ledge halfway up the cliff face. Bloody footprints from some sort of predatory animal are plainly visible along the edge of the path, providing a bit of insight into the decaying animal remains. The road reaches the top of the cliff up the gentle slope to the east.  Some greying oak planks are here.

Several large cracks split the roads surface at odd angles, threatening to swallow unwary travelers. Large and very unsteady wooden boards have been placed across the gaps, creating makeshift bridges. Many of the boards have a significant curve to them, suggesting that they may have been the victim of a rather large traveler.

A large gap in the roadway is now spanned by a rickety looking wood and rope bridge. The slats seem to be spaced just close enough so that a wagon wheel does not get lodged between them. The remnants of the foundations of an old stone bridge are evident on both sides of this gap. A few hundred feet below the present bridge, the former one is visible in several pieces. Considering the state of the old bridge, this unstable replacement does not exactly inspire feelings of safety.  A decrepit looking wood and rope bridge is here.

A large pile of unexplained wooden crates and barrels have been tossed unceremoniously in an alcove off the side of the main road. They have all been scavenged long ago and simply lie abandoned by their owners. For hundreds of feet in either direction, the road surface is covered in deep grooves, making wagon travel quite hazardous. Even at a slow pace the vibrations are intense enough to damage cargo. This is made evident as a heavily laden wagon shudders down the slope. Swearing loudly, the merchant tosses what sounds like a crate full of broken glass into the alcove before continuing onward.  A pile of wooden crates and barrels is here.

The poor construction of this road becomes quickly evident. Water is flowing down over the sides of the cliff above and across the road surface. Due to the slight slope of the road toward the deep chasm to the south, this section of road is quite hazardous. Many broken pieces of rope and metal spikes are strewn all over the pathway; evidently failed attempts to keep wagons from sliding over the side. Large piles of heavy looking stones have now been stacked along the edge of the gorge in hopes it will prevent trade carts from careening off the edge. Several of these stones seem to be missing. Evidently the idea is not working as well as was hoped.  A large pile of stones and a large pile of stones are here.

The cliff face to the north is slightly more sloped than others, allowing far more vegetation to grow on it. Small shapes are visible scurrying about among the grasses and shrubs, most of them reacting to any movement on the road. A few are visible up the road ahead, but quickly vanish at the distant screech of a raptor. It is a few moments before they curiously return.  Some small cute striped chipmunks are here.

Despite the fact the cliffs to the north are nearly vertical, various plants still cling to life against them. Many are common weeds or merely grasses, but some are delicate wildflowers, leaving little or no explanation as to their presence on the cliff. One small tree is also attempting to take root along the cliffside, its branches jutting out at odd angles.  An oddly shaped rosewood tree is here.

Just to the south is the juncture where old merchant road connected to this new road. Just beyond that is the deep gorge that has swallowed up the old road. The road surface is a stable solid rock, but is barely large enough for a single wagon to pass through. Unlike the new merchant road to the southwest, this road follows a more natural flow up the eastern cliffside carefully traversing the steep mountain. A single yellow wildflower grows defiantly out of the rocky cliff, giving a stark contrast to the solid grey that surrounds it.  A small yellow wildflower is here.

A lone carrion bird seems to stare from the branches of a gnarled old tree. The road surface alternates between the usual hard-packed dirt covered in gravel, and solid rock. The terrain creates even more difficult travel for those heading north or south. A large pile of broken wagons, barrels, and boxes lie quite some distance below. Many skeletons of pack animals, picked clean by carrion birds, are also discernible. It is highly likely some of the bones are Humanoid as well.

The old merchant road lies in pieces at the bottom of a deep gorge far below. An artificial pathway has been constructed in the wake of the recent collapse, allowing continued passage through the mountains. This new merchant road has been constructed in great haste and is still quite unstable. Gravel that has been spread on the road to make it safer, is actually making it far more precarious. Pebbles roll continuously off of the roads surface and down into the chasm below.

A treacherous dusty trail leads west along the shaky fault line from a fork in the main road. The original roadbed has fallen into the chasm years ago, leaving the merchants to their own wiles to ply the slippery slopes past the fault zone. Many attempts have failed at conquering the shifting dirt and rocks. Currently a bumpy trail skirts the bigger rocks and loose gravel.

As the merchant road approaches the western end of the valley, the valley wall abruptly falls away to a sheer drop. Crumbling rock and dirt spill constantly into the deep abyss. Sections of the mountain have slid away into the valley and the merchant road has been rebuilt higher along the steeper sides of the mountain. The fault line of broken rocks continues its path of destruction to the west, skirted by the land-slide prone softer dirt.   A freshly uncovered crevice is here.

                                    Visualization #1 is:
Through the gate lies the city of Spur, the major center of trade and civilization on the plains. The dusty road leading through the gates is well traveled, and walls of the city are in good repair. A small shack sits to the west of the road, during most times of the day a dusty coach can be seen waiting in front, its horses stomping with impatience to be gone. To the right of the door is a small window, its opening covered with metal bars. An old man, missing most of his teeth, waits patiently for the travelers to pay their fare, and then directs them into the waiting area. On the east side of the road a billowing multicolored tent has been erected, the hustle and bustle of merchants and customers can be seen coming and going at all times of the day.

                                    Visualization #2 is:
Each corner of this square gives entrance to one of the fort's four business establishments. The bank is small, but adequate. The pawnshop and store will see to your buying and selling needs, and the Tarath Wayside Inn is open at all hours to provide shelter for residents and foreigners alike.

                                    Visualization #3 is:
Carefully winding its way up the base of the tree, and wrapping itself around the stairs, a flowering jasmine vine grows tall and lush. Dark scars from a past fire are almost hidden under tufts of fresh growth and moss. A large gap, nearly sixteen feet in distance, rests between the base of a set of stairs and the forest floor. A long moonsilver cord hangs down the side of the tree. If one pulls it, the long Elven rope will descend from above, allowing them to enter the great city of Treehaven. Bright green leaves of clover have begun springing up through the ashy soil in conjunction with soft moss to lend a durable cushion to this well-traveled spot.

A short tremor suddenly rocks the cracked merchant road! A dusty pall sifts into the air from cracks in the ground and the shifting of gravel around the valley.  The tremor rolls through the canyon walls like a ripple, as if it were a linen sheet that was lifted and settled again. Pack animals and travelers alike stop momentarily and then hasten their pace as if to leave the quake behind them.

The momentous forces that have wrought this valley still press upon the land and have done so for eons.  The walls of the valley are sheer and steep, and untouched by the raging waters of river or stream.  As if in testimony to the power of the forces that move the land, a huge dark boulder sits off to the side of the road. It is hewn in half like a sliced melon.  One part sits 20 feet north along the break in the rocks from the other part.

One layer of rock in the steep walls has eroded faster then the harder granite or bedrock above and below it. Soft sandstone has been stripped away to form an arch in the valley wall ... a concave indention that goes for hundreds of feet in both directions.  Within the hardened sediment left ages ago upon the land are treasures beyond value: fossilized shells by the thousands, in all sizes, shapes and colors.

The merchant road threads through bottom of the small, narrow valley. Sheer granite walls block the view from the well traveled road to either side and above, only a narrow ray of sky testifies to the time of day. The engineers set a route as far as possible from the broken stones in the center of the valley and, by luck or design, this foresight has saved the road-bed from constant reconstruction. Small cracks run parallel to the road, but none have broken through the thick layers of sand and stone.

A brisk wind barrels down from the mountains to the north, its touch filled with the promise of ice and snow. As it passes the dry road-bed, it mixes with the warm moist air of the river valley that creeps north and causes dust dervishes that spin their opaque bodies thousands of feet into the air. The sharp bladed grasses shiver and swirl as the tiny twisters weave their way across the steppe.

Game trails cut back and forth across the merchants road covered with the split, sharp toed hoof prints of deer and elk. Dark spoor mark the trails most frequently used by the herbivores: the hunted. Sharp yipping pierces the cold, quiet air from both sides of the road: the hunters. The widely spaced junipers, scrub oaks, and mountain hawthorns offer ample cover for the pack of wolves to range unseen through the plateau.

Blending perfectly with the muted hues of the arid surroundings, a lone timber wolf stalks the outer edges of the grassland about a half a mile from the merchant road. The wolf's ears are perked to listen for the rustling of the bushy tailed jack rabbits that thrive in the prairie. The wolf lifts it nose to catch a scent, howls briefly and trots off towards the southeast to catch it's prey from downwind.

Bright green trees and healthy bushes stand out sporadically on the dusty steppe. The little spring fed islands are surrounded by the blue-green grasses that thrive here. All manner of beasts are drawn to the springs and the protection they offer. Bright blue scrub jays chatter noisily among themselves as they dart and swerve in accomplished aerial feats pursuing their winged insect meals. A small herd of wary jackrabbits stop munching the grass to turn their white ears towards the merchant road. The nearest jack to the road stands on his hind legs and tests the air for any scent of their many predators.

Thicker stalked grasses grow here on this high plateau where the air is rarified and rain spills quickly down the small rocky gullies. A few staunch oaks grow alone or in groups of one or two, their roots exposed where they cling to the rocky soil for sustenance. Thin, scraggly junipers suck up what little moisture the soil does manage to hold. The merchant road placidly passes by, untouched by time in the dry environment.

The merchant road swerves around a rock strewn hill. Several ancient oak trees grow in solitary wonder on the south side of the hill. Dead fall and broken branches cover the hollow and is home for a family of thick furred marmots. The dark brown colored rodents stare out of the dark recesses of the dead branches with shiny black eyes. A brace of buck-toothed, adolescent marmots scramble for cover as the shrill cry of a hawk sounds further up the mountain.

To the southeast, two streams trickle from the north and pass directly under the roadbed. The twin streams combine as they travel down the hill to make a picture-perfect waterfall rimmed by delicate maidenhair ferns and bright green moss. The little riverlet from the pool then flows into an ancient oak forest further southeast.

Hand pounded concrete pipes, half circle in shape, channel two small streams under the chinked rock and gravel road-bed. The icy spring water bubbles down the hill and glides over a sheet of shorn granite until it fills a crystal clear pool at the bottom, far below the road. The pool's overflow creates a single clear stream that meanders towards the ancient oak forest.

The high steppe grasslands yields to a green wall of oak trees to the southeast. The oak forest is very old, the greying trunks of the behemoths are cracked and split. The road immediately darkens under the canopy of the green leaves. Pale green bracken ferns grow tall in the eternal twilight shade. Flat, yellow capped mushrooms and rippled shelf fungi sprout from the fallen trees. The pleasant aroma of healthy decomposing leaves fills the air.

The merchant road takes a large bend as it travels through the dark woodland. Venerable, wide-trunked oaks line the merchant road and the trunks of the closest ones have been marked by the passage of thousands of travelers and adventurers. Some have carved their initials, some, a picture of loved ones or body parts of odd proportions, and some, the date they passed by.

Off to the side of the road, perhaps a hundred feet away, stands an enormous tree that commands the attention of all who pass this direction. It's offspring populate the plateau for miles in both directions. At one time, the tree must have stood alone on the prairie soil and dropped acorns year after year until one tree became a huge forest of oaks.

The merchant road follows a bumpy path through the oak forest. Each stately old tree has added a few feet to it's girth since the road was first surveyed and constructed hundreds of years ago. Their roots have plied across the road, upending it's hand laid foundation and hand pounded bed. Several large knees of the oak's roots have leveraged up the edges of the road, hindering all wagons' passage and threatening to break spokes and axles.

The merchant road makes a wide turn as it passes through the thick oak forest. A tiny meadow with a murmuring creek is the only open spot in sight. Bright wildflowers and fragrant mosses crowd around a sparkling jewel of a pond while the huge oaks stand like sentinels around the edges. A spotted fawn and its doe-eyed mother drink cautiously, swishing their white edged tails quickly.

Crunching loudly on the road is a ankle high deposit of acorn hulls and their discarded caps. Quick footed grey squirrels dash across the road, or above on the high intertwined branches of the stately oaks, with the highly coveted acorns grasped firmly in their teeth. The squirrels flash their tails at each other in some unknown signal as traffic passes on the road.  A pile of empty acorn caps is here.

The grassland plateau is embraced by a stand of dark green oak trees so thick that little light passes through the profusion of their many lobed leaves. The forest is ancient and the trunks of the trees bare witness to fires, lightning strikes and the attacks of insects. Large gout-like burls disfigure some of the wide, grey trunks which have grown quietly next to the road for hundreds of years.

The merchant roads widens as it travels another grass swept plateau. The mountain range fills the northern skyline in stark detail. Huge snow capped peaks and rough faced cliffs are close enough to see the individual boulders, waterfalls, and haphazard game trails. Much higher up the great mountainsides a line where trees stop growing gives testament to the altitude. The air is cool.

The roadway takes advantage of a cut in the hill to negotiate a tumbled cliff face. At the top of the hill is a high, flat, steppe grassland, and at the bottom is the edge of the open range. At one point, the road narrows to cross a small stream. Very little mud gathers in the shallows of the stream and the pebbles and rocks glitter like gold as the wagon wheels churn the gravel.

White barked birch trees populate the moist valleys that drain into the river to the southeast as the merchant road passes nearby.

Running parallel to the road is a smooth rock lined trench that channels the road's run-off during rainstorms. This flat part of the road that follows the valley floor would be prone to turn into a muddy bog and therefore a hazard to most caravans and their pack animals. Anticipating this event, the road's engineers built drains into the lower side of the road that carry the runoff into the culvert, which carries it harmlessly down to the low end of the valley.

Water loving trees hug the river's course through the low lying valley. Giant beech and huge alders vie for the valuable sodden shoreline and shade the understory bushes and ferns from direct sunlight. The result is a lushly green, verdant forest that obscures the river from the view on the road, though the hiss of rushing water reveals it's course.

The decaying remains of the bridge workers camp sprawls across this flat valley. To house their draft beasts, the workers constructed small stalls and shelters from rickety boards nailed quixotically to the standing trees. Three brass ring topped posts lie sunk into the grasslands turf, to the south, which was most likely used for tethering grazing animals. Between the posts is a rough stone trough that is filled automatically with water by a rickety mechanical wind mill, whirling lazily in the breeze.

Boulders stacked in pyramids contained by large timbers stand mutely to the side of the roadway next to an impromptu dump of broken tools, wooden stakes and empty buckets lined with mortar. Deeply grooved sled tracks lead to the east towards the bridge from this part of the road where the flatness of the valley was best suited for the staging area during the bridge's reconstruction. Smooth rectangles of tent foundations still mark their location in a semi circle around a blackened fire ring where the workers and their supervisors lived during it's rebuilding.

On the northern edge of the road stands a tall, flat rock. Chipped into the shape of a pillar and abraded to smoothness, it bears the stamped surveyor's mark of the road's builder. The mark's grooved letters are filled with sand and dust and obscured from age, but the arrows delineating north, south, east and west are clear and easy to read. The rest of the stamp is undecipherable and lends mystery to the road's origin.

A brown and white osprey soars above the raging river, scanning the water for a meal. Suddenly, it dives down to the surface and snatches a rather large trout from the water.

Withstanding seasonal floods and constant traffic, the durable road shows how affective good design and competent construction can be. It travels a hand paved berm straight to an imposing grey stone bridge to the southeast. The pilons of the bridge are cloaked in river mist as the raging river sweeps by. Only the brightness of the fluttering flags that top the spans stand out sharply.

A massive stone bridge spans a raging grey tinted river as it runs it's course towards the southeast. The mud around the bridge footings has been churned by wheels of quarry wagons, tracks of sleds bearing block and tackle, shod hooves of draft beasts and booted feet of masons and bridge workers. The newer parts of the huge bridge are obvious due to the contrast in colors of mortar and rock. Bright banners snap briskly in the wind from both ends of the bridge.  A broken wooden wagon is here.

Just to the north, the roadway curves gently around a bend in a large river that flows towards the southeast. An enormous smooth round rock splits off a small eddy from the main current resulting a deep, clear pool by the eastern side of the road. The cool calm water catches the reflection of the white snowcapped mountain range further up the valley while the river rushes past towards Spur. Five fishermen recline on folding chairs or against rocks, tethered by the silvery lines of their poles to the fishing hole.

Empty wooden crates, broken harnesses, damaged pottery, and the usual byproducts of food preparation fill an impromptu refuse pile adjacent to two campsites. Both two and four legged scavengers ply through the pile, scattering it further and enlarging the boundary. The result is a landmark of incongruous shapes, colors and shadows along the otherwise bland sweep of grasslands through which the roadway travels.

Broadening to fill the lee of a wide valley, the roadway passes by several temporary campsites where caravans have bolstered the existing comforts for their temporary encampments. Neat stacks of foraged sticks and axe-hewn firewood sit adjacent to the blackened rocks of two impromptu fire rings. Freshly dug midden pits waft clues to the camp's frequent use into the clean mountain air.

The worn merchants road travels the southern side of a low hill in one wide arc. The broad path is slightly banked to accomodate for the turn and incline. On the exposed side of the road, the sturdy road-bed is exposed to the elements and yet has remained solid. A neatly kept plank house with a stone well and fenced paddock overlooks grain fields to the southeast.

The road charges across a flat valley through waving stalks of grain with coppery tinted seeds. Around the northern edge grows a row of huge cypress trees with trunks that measure eight feet across. Debris from the trees' self-trimming mats the taller grasses into an impenetrable wall. The cypresses produce the necessary windbreak for the field to bear the heavy headed grain.

As the road bends around a curve, ruts left by merchant's wagons cut so deeply into the mud that all wheeled vehicles are forced to follow the set path. Four loaded wagons of a merchants caravan stand idle as one larger than standard wagon skitters along the path. The buckboard's frame groans and strains to keep it inline while the driver attempts to negotiate the turn. Four dark maned, matched mules balk at the noise behind them, and stomp nervously over the deep ruts. The liveried caravan guards attempt to haul the mules forward, further adding to the mules stubborn refusal to move.

Aged and splintered into the vague circular shape, a decaying wagon wheel is left to rot in the grass by the roadside. Their roots protectively sheltered from the weather, idiosyntric sprouts of taller grasses thrive haphazardly inside the wheel. Several tiny holes top small pyramids of sandy debris, where a few red fire ants scout their wagon-wheel domain for fodder.

The travel-worn road dips and curves around the low lying foothills. Each pass over the top of hillsides presents a new view of the mountain range. Each dip into small valleys reveal minute eco-systems that exist in each wagon wheel rut where water collects. Splayed avion tracks dot the dried mud in random order permanently recording the hunters conquest of lesser things from the mud and moss.

The road diverts around a small pool of murky water that lies to the north. A confusion of hoof prints muddies the shoreline where the placid bovines have come to water themselves. The pool is damned by a small hillock which allows no drainage so the pool remains stagnant. The mountains to the north reflect in perfectly upside-down symmetry on the still pond's surface, only wavering slightly in concentric circles to the deft touch of small insects.

A rickety criss-crossed rough beam fence pens the grazing of black and white cows whose ponderous forms are barely visible through the tall grass on either side of the road. To the north, the soft, undulating grassland floor of the wide valley succumbs to the rolling foothills, which in turn delineates the imposing outline of a vista-spanning mountain range. Many a traveler has witnessed this idyllic vantage point and has been drawn on to follow the road that travels into the heart of the mountains.

From the west spans a dark green forest of Sycamore and Beech trees that soak in the moister parts of the lower river valley. The tall, shaded forest breaks like a green tinged wave upon the tranquil calm of the grasslands. The huge trees within are ancient, reaching hundreds of feet into the air. As if steaming from a great cauldron, a heavy ground fog seeps from deep within the forest carrying with it the fresh smell of decomposing green matter.

Lush grass grows up to the borders of a thick, dense forest that cloaks the hills to the west. The grasslands thin near the grove as the huge trees completely shade the ground, and are replaced by taller bushes and juniper trees. The contrast between the waving stalks on the flat vista and the dark leaves of almost vertical trees is striking.

In the dusty distance, Spur's great wall demarks the southern end of this well-traveled merchant's road. Soaring majestically to the north stands the spiky pinnacles and snow topped peaks of an epic mountain range so immense that it separates lands, races, and cultures. Connecting the two is a merchant road built long ago.

The path is flanked by countless tall oaks, swaying peacefully in the wind. They do their best to hide the sky from view, making it hard to tell night from day at times. Littering the area are pieces of broken wagon, bits of human remains and dried splotches of blood. The remnants of a violent fight lie all around you, whomever used to belong to the wagon is no more than vulture food.  A bloody severed foot is here.

Travelers from Rathan to the northwest, and the Trade Route to the south, converge at Spur's west gate. Guards posted on the ground give those seeking to enter the city a cursory once-over. Their lack of interest shows that anyone approaching has already been observed from above for some time. A grate in the ground loosens mud from wagon wheels and hooves before they pass through the gate, helping to keep the streets of Spur fairly clean.  An open giant black iron gate, a giant green oak tree, a small blue pool, a thick oak grate over the pool, and a polished stone marker are here.

The relative safety inside Spur is a comfort to those returning from the fields and mountains. To those leaving, a massive wall of defense around the city lies ahead. Archer towers beside the gate overlook the wall, offering a painful welcome to would-be invaders. Several guards on foot patrol pass and disappear behind a thick, bluesteel banded steelwood door. Wall road stretches to the south, a wide passage between the city wall and several large buildings.  An open iron gate, an open thick stone door, and a street lantern are here.

Vast estates tower over the huge Spurian wall towards the south. The well-to-do who live in these homes idle away their days, enjoying the luxury of time. Standing next to a very empty lantern pole, a small Flerian child insists in a plaintive wail, that he had nothing to do with the missing lantern. The well-dressed guard that interrogates him keeps pointing at a small sack on the ground and its obvious contents.  An open small burlap sack, a street lantern, and a lantern are here.

Set in the marble base is a small plaque that reads, "For those who have gone before us." Many stand for a moment as they pass this way, giving thanks for the gift of life that is given by both the apple tree and the Secians of long ago. Large piles of dirt and broken stone lay on either side of the street as workmen ready the east and west alleys for expansion.  A street lantern, an open Secian etched moonsilver door, a pair of open silver forged swinging doors, and a sign above the doors are here.

However, they are no easier to access, still protected by their own guarding walls, some covered with ivy or colorful blooming vines.  A street lantern is here.

[Noble Way.]

Occasional gates and driveways lead back into the well-kept estates of the city's nobility, breaking and adding interest to the defining plane of the walls lining Noble Way. The rest of the street seems to mimic the splendor of the estates beyond the wall. Swept and trimmed, the roadway exudes a simple, yet beautiful elegance.  A street lantern is here.

[Noble Crossroads.]

A small roadway bordered by flowering hedges bisects the wide avenue of Noble Way at a right angle, heading east to west.  A thick, sturdy sign stands just off to the side of a charming path, its large friendly letters intent on luring travelers into the city's premiere roadstay, the Gilded Lion Inn. The entrance is clearly marked and welcoming, extending off to the southeast.  A wooden sign and a street lantern are here.

Majestic elms continue to line this broad roadway, sheltering the avenue on both sides and further enhancing the grandiose atmosphere. Fronting the beautiful homes, cobbled paths edged with narrow flower beds meander through nearby private gardens. Though they appear wonderful places to spend an afternoon or take a picnic, the glances from those tending the estates makes it clear they are only for the invited.  A street lantern is here.

The occasional locked gate marks the entrance to some of the more hidden estates of Spurs nobility. From this broad avenue, little can be seen of their splendor. Behind the imposing gate recedes a proud drive, disappearing mysteriously into the trees. If not for the large imposing tower rising above the hedges it would be hard to discern anything was beyond the gate. It is apparent the residents do not wish to be disturbed.  A street lantern, a closed morbius door, and an open black iron gate are here.

[South Gate.]

A well-guarded gateway separates the city's residential district from the farmlands just beyond. Guards carefully eye all that enter or exit the city, beckoning gruffly to random travelers for a closer inspection. The structure of the guards' barracks is visible above the road to the west. A weathered wooden sign is posted by the gate.  An open stone gate, a wooden sign, an open thick stone door, and a street lantern are here.

[South gate.]

Through the gate lies the city of Spur, the major center of trade and civilization on the plains. The dusty road leading through the gates is well traveled, and walls of the city are in good repair. A small shack sits to the west of the road, during most times of the day a dusty coach can be seen waiting in front, its horses stomping with impatience to be gone. To the right of the door is a small window, its opening covered with metal bars. An old man, missing most of his teeth, waits patiently for the travelers to pay their fare, and then directs them into the waiting area. On the east side of the road a billowing multicolored tent has been erected, the hustle and bustle of merchants and customers can be seen coming and going at all times of the day.  An open iron gate and a rainbow silk tent are here.

Even though it shows heavy wear, the road is in remarkably good repair. It was built by expert craftsmen to withstand the rigors of time and use. Evidence of recent repairs indicate that any problems are dealt with quickly and competently.  Some dried crimson streaks of blood and an open old wooden trash wagon are here.

A gateway to the west serves as one of the two main entrances to Spur's fairgrounds. To the south, you can barely make out the dark line of the hedge, a thick growth of trees and bushes that separates the true wilds from the tame city lands.  An iron gate is here.

This narrow tunnel through the hedge leads up to the gateway that lets out to the wilderness beyond. Though it used to see heavy traffic from the south, the docks have made this gate largely a place of semi-banishment for the guards.  An open bronze gate is here.

[Wilderness gate.]

Set within a wide tunnel leading through the hedge to the north is the Wilderness Gate. It separates the settled lands of Spur from the open plains to the south of the city. The plains stretch as far as the eyes can see, the horizon and the walls of the fort down the road the only blemishes of the grassy landscape in the distance. The stones of the road are smoothly set together, well built to withstand heavy travel. A broken wagon wheel, discarded some time ago, covers a spot of nearby grass, weeds trying to climb through the spokes.  An open bronze gate is here.

[Southern Tradeway.]

The tradeway runs across the open grasslands northeast towards the Spur, and southwest towards distant lands and eventually, the coast. The plains to the south and east seem totally indifferent to your existence. Just ahead, a small path moves up a village of huts spread out in a semi-circle. In the center of the village a giant fire pit sits where barbarians who wander through the village can sit around to stay warm.  A worn grassy path is here.

[Southern Tradeway.]

The stone paved tradeway stretches across the open plains, interrupting nature's task of consuming the land. An endless sea of grass surrounds you, lapping at the road much like the tides against a beach. The faintly damp wind occasionally blowing in from the west smells of earth. Some of the stones in the road interlock together to form the crude image of a lion. There is no discerning if it was done on purpose or sheer accident.

[Southern Tradeway.]

Only the well-built, stone tradeway gives any hint of civilization ever having had any presence here. The tall grasses limit visibility nearby, hiding any wildlife that may be waiting for prey to stumble too close. A few blades of grass sway slightly in the breeze, some of them broken by the passing of something heavy over them. One of the larger stones in the road, broken loose from its mortar, waits patiently to be repaired.

The grass rises taller and taller in every direction further limiting view just off the roadside. A second glance reveals that this is the lowest point in a large, shallow depression. The tradeway sinks a little lower as it gets closer to the river off to the west. A ditch runs alongside the river's side of the road, small puddles of water filling the bottom. Trickles filter into the puddles from the grass beyond as mosquitoes dart across the muddy surfaces.

Rising up out of the plains, a large walled fort receives the end of the stone road. The river flows from either side, running through the fort from this angle of view. The vegetation surrounding the tradeway at this point hasrecently, allowing a clear field of vision from the tops of the walls ahead. The stones show little wear from the heavy traffic.

Two guards patrol above the gate, looking you over carefully before giving leave to pass through the heavy wood gate. Thick and long wooden ladders serve up to the guard's posts high in the sky so that they may have some relief from their duties overlooking the land and city. Through the slates of the wooden walkways, you can make out four archers playing a game of cards, weapons at the ready. A whip cracks loudly as a caravan heads out the gate towards Spur.  An open wooden gate is here.

Within the heart of this proud fort one can see all around that the reconstruction of its buildings has begun. Large stones and logs have been stacked and piled, while some workers tirelessly attempt to repair the damage that occurred here during the Lords of Chaos wars. The buildings and homes of the people that resided here are slowly taking shape, though, far from completed. The smell of dyes, used to paint the town, permeate the area.  A breathtaking shimmering bouquet of moonflowers, an open light blue door, and a glowing wrought iron street lantern are here.

Off to the north one can make out the familiar sound of money. The clanking of coins can be heard distinctly. One of the only buildings that happened to survive in this fort from the days of lore, the bank. A small man can be seen traveling to and from the sidewalk to the very spot you are at with his hand held out and a look of sorrow in his eyes. His demeanor and countenance denotes that he might have once been a dignitary of the fort, but like the fort he and it strive to come back from the shambles.

Off to the north one can make out the familiar sound of money. The clanking of coins can be heard distinctly. One of the only buildings that happened to survive in this fort from the days of lore, the bank. A small man can be seen traveling to and from the sidewalk to the very spot you are at with his hand held out and a look of sorrow in his eyes. His demeanor and countenance denotes that he might have once been a dignitary of the fort, but like the fort he and it strive to come back from the shambles.

Within the heart of this proud fort one can see all around that the reconstruction of its buildings has begun. Large stones and logs have been stacked and piled, while some workers tirelessly attempt to repair the damage that occurred here during the Lords of Chaos wars. The buildings and homes of the people that resided here are slowly taking shape, though, far from completed. The smell of dyes, used to paint the town, permeate the area.  A breathtaking shimmering bouquet of moonflowers, an open light blue door, and a glowing wrought iron street lantern are here.

Thick and long wooden ladders serve up to the guard's posts high in the sky so that they may have some relief from their duties overlooking the land and city.

The grass rises taller and taller in every direction further limiting view just off the roadside. A second glance reveals that this is the lowest point in a large, shallow depression. The tradeway sinks a little lower as it gets closer to the river off to the west. A ditch runs alongside the river's side of the road, small puddles of water filling the bottom. Trickles filter into the puddles from the grass beyond as mosquitoes dart across the muddy surfaces.

Only the well-built, stone tradeway gives any hint of civilization ever having had any presence here. The tall grasses limit visibility nearby, hiding any wildlife that may be waiting for prey to stumble too close. A few blades of grass sway slightly in the breeze, some of them broken by the passing of something heavy over them. One of the larger stones in the road, broken loose from its mortar, waits patiently to be repaired.

The stone paved tradeway stretches across the open plains, interrupting nature's task of consuming the land. An endless sea of grass surrounds you, lapping at the road much like the tides against a beach. The faintly damp wind occasionally blowing in from the west smells of earth. Some of the stones in the road interlock together to form the crude image of a lion. There is no discerning if it was done on purpose or sheer accident.

The plains stretch as far as the eyes can see, the horizon and the walls of the fort down the road the only blemishes of the grassy landscape in the distance. The stones of the road are smoothly set together, well built to withstand heavy travel. A broken wagon wheel, discarded some time ago, covers a spot of nearby grass, weeds trying to climb through the spokes.  An open bronze gate is here.

A hedge of spiky brambles forms a natural division from the lands and the swampy terrain to the south. Tall, limbless trees dot the horizon there, their bases lost in the misty depths of the gases hovering over the waters. Now and then a strange, growling sound echos up to the north, or an odd, high-pitched call of some unseen crow, probably feasting on a fallen creature hidden in the mists.

The road becomes a bridge to cross a small river that meanders its way out of the forest to your northeast.  Oddly, the wooden planks of the bridge don't seem to be held up by anything.

Runoff from the river to the west makes the ground all around soggy.  It appears to be even more wet to the northeast where a small marsh sits at the entrance to a huge forest spanning as far east as the eye can see.

Large trees begin to bunch around the road that has become little more than a path leading through the undergrowth.  The forest begins to fill your vision as you continue.

As you continue into the forest, you begin to forget that there were ever other colors than brown, green, and black.  As suddenly as that thought comes, you see a set of piercing red eyes in the shadows, that soon scurry away.  A massive iron wheeled sledge and a crew of workers are here.

Puddles of murky water dully reflect the giant trees that surround you.  You feel the prickle of eyes watching you, though you don't get a feeling of malice, just curiosity.  Some deep muddy sledge tracks are here.

Obvious paths: east west northwest.
[Trail.]

To the west, tall grasses and scraggly trees obscure the view of a small town.  Creating a natural barrier to the east are rows of thorny hedges.  A haze of dark green can be seen to the northeast.  Some deep muddy sledge tracks are here.

Obvious paths: northeast west.
[Trail.]

The hedgerows grow less dense and the ground becomes soft and springy. The air has taken on a moist and uncomfortably clammy feel. The top of a very tall hill can be seen far to the southeast.  Some deep muddy sledge tracks are here.

This looks to be the northern edge of the Eastlands marsh. Each step becomes more difficult as the ground becomes a muddy bog. Straying from the trail would be unwise at this point.  Some deep muddy sledge tracks are here.

[Trail.]

The trail abruptly disappears into a dense wall of foggy mist. The ground here is soggy. Each step sets off a cacophony of buzzing insects, accompanied by the squelching sound of boots being grabbed by slimy muck.  Some deep muddy sledge tracks are here.

This area is not illuminated.
Obvious paths: north southwest.
[Trail.]

The trail skirts the border of the dismal marsh. Noxious vapors rise from the stagnant waters that lap at the noticeably narrowing route. What had been a dark green haze can now be distinguished as a massive forest.  Some deep muddy sledge tracks are here.

Murky water has encroached upon the trail, making the way treacherous. A careful survey of the watery surroundings shows a faint path veering sharply to the north, away from the marsh and toward the forest.  Some deep muddy sledge tracks are here.

The soggy trail becomes a solid dirt path, sheltered by the trees of a forest whose boundary begins where the swamp ends. The path heads northwest, leading you into the forest proper.

Through the branches of stately trees, glimpses of the sky can be seen. The path continues, winding northwest through the eastern edge of the forest.

Obvious paths: southwest northwest.
[Path.]

Chittering noises come from overhead and tree branches dip and sway. A small brown shape scampers across the path, gone before it can be glimpsed and identified. The path disappears into a copse of saplings.  A thick copse of saplings, a huge long flat-platform hauler, a huge long flat-platform hauler, a huge long flat-platform hauler, a crew of guild movers, and some wide muddy canvas tents are here.

Obvious paths: northeast southeast.
[Copse.]

The sounds of small animals scampering in the underbrush and trilling chirps from the branches overhead provide ample evidence that the forest is a hospitable home to wildlife.   A leaf covered iron snare is here.

Obvious paths: east south southwest west.
[Copse.]

The undergrowth thins here, and you are able to pick up traces of the path. To the east, where only a thin line of small trees mark the forest boundary, the marsh ends its reign and what appears to be a grassy plain begins.  Some deep muddy wheel ruts are here.

The path becomes better defined, though it is still difficult to follow in the undergrowth, which has grown more dense. It is evident that the path at one time was a well-traveled route. Perhaps to the Spur?

The path progresses along, still skirting the eastern boundary of the forest. Other than the occasional noises common to woodlands, there is no evidence of higher forms of life. A squirrel streaks through the underbrush and up the trunk of a tree.

The trees are becoming taller, and their trunks larger, as you make your way along. The smaller birch and beech trees have given way to graceful elms. A low growl comes from amidst the trunks of the trees, but it is impossible to determine the direction.  A flower entwined iron trap is here.

Obvious paths: northeast southeast.
[Path.]

Trees surround you on all sides; for a moment the path is lost to sight. Something slithers through the underbrush. Try as you might, you can't identify what it might have been. You feel uneasy, as though something is watching your every move.  An overgrown path is here.

Obvious paths: northeast southwest northwest.
[Brambles.]

Struggling through the underbrush, you make your way down the small trail only to be brought up short by an impenetrable wall of brambles. Plump red berries hang from the small branches of the bushes, guarded by long, sharp thorns. On a low hanging branch overhead, a watchful owl stares at you with golden eyes.  A slightly hidden trail, an ethereal looking owl, and some fragrant red rose petals are here.

Obvious paths: southwest northwest.
[Thicket.]

Winding through the trees, the path emerges from the dense foliage and continues northward. You begin to wonder if there is a way into the seemingly impenetrable western forest. A track, that looks to be one used by small animals, veers off to the side.  A leaf covered iron snare is here.

The footbridge that once connected this path to its match on the other side of the overflowing rushing river is now nothing more then a few charred pilings. Tiny insects buzz around their remains, finding a comfortable new home. Lashed to the remains of one of the more sturdy pilings is a tall steel pole. Wrapped around the pole, and tied securely is a taut rope. Bobbing ever so lightly due to the strain of the riverboat, the rope holds tight.  A flowing river, a freshly painted sign, some carved oak benches, and a riverboat are here.

Lined with wooden seats, this slim oak boat looks to be able to carry its passengers relatively quickly to their destination. A sturdy rope is threaded through a steel eyelet that rises about two feet above the bow of the boat. The captain's muscles strain, with each heave-ho on the rope, as the boat cleaves through the deep waters of the river. A thick mist circles about the river and the boat as it, very slowly, is pulled across the river.  A wooden railing is here.
