The chipped bark path widens to encompass a broad square between the peaked roofs of the village homes, the larger storefronts, and several communal buildings that all surround a magnificent fountain crafted from local sandstone. The multi-tiered fountain flows with pure, clean springwater and provides seating around its broad base.  The towering trees surround the village, enclosing the square in a living frame.  To the west is a sturdy building with its door perpetually ajar. A line of Leuian children trots off towards the north, bearing their lessons. The faint ding of nautical bells flows in on the breeze from the northwest.   A flowing gold-flecked sandstone fountain and a fine Leuian porcelain plate are here.

The chipped bark path widens to encompass a broad square between the peaked roofs of the village homes, the larger storefronts, and several communal buildings that all surround a magnificent fountain crafted from local sandstone. The multi-tiered fountain flows with pure, clean springwater and provides seating around its broad base.  The towering trees surround the village, enclosing the square in a living frame.  To the west is a sturdy building with its door perpetually ajar. A line of Leuian children trots off towards the north, bearing their lessons. The faint ding of nautical bells flows in on the breeze from the northwest.   A flowing gold-flecked sandstone fountain, a fine Leuian porcelain plate, and a fine Leuian porcelain plate are here.

An immense, smoothed river boulder deposited by the river, eons ago, is imbedded in the soft loam of the forest floor and blocks the view of the river to the north. A few giant trees have grown bent around its rounded shape and an innovative homeowner has taken advantage of the resulting shelter. Built carefully among the trees in the lee of the rock, stands a magnificent example of the same peaked wooden beam homes that dot the entire forest. One fledgling tree pokes its head through a well-planned hole in the roof.  A pair of closed magnificent carved steelwood doors, a slippery downhill path, and a stack of rocks are here.

Amidst the towering trees and verdant mid level bushes, several smaller cabins blend into the surrounding park. The peaked roofs of the cabins bear the familiar carving as seen on most of the village homes and their small porches sport plantings of flowering wild roses and perky daisies accented with the fronds of leather ferns and shelf fungus.  A closed chiseled petrified redwood door, a closed arched slate grey granite boulder door, a closed salt stained cargo hatch, a closed vine etched glass door, and a decaying pile of planks are here.

A grove of young, green-needled pine trees surrounds a small meadow of vibrantly flowering rhododendrons. Hues of bright pink, red, and white create a stunning contrast against the darker grey bark of the pines. Brighter green hemlock trees spread to catch the sunlight, which, in turn, shelter smaller stands of delicious salmonberry bushes, airy leather ferns, and poignantly fragranced sorrels that thrive on the compost of the forest floor. Soft haircap moss covers the river stone-lined path, dew from the mist collecting on it like pollen on bees. The distant wash of rushing water quietly filters through the peaceful air that hangs heavily saturated with moisture.  A stack of rocks is here.

A soothing peace has settled over the forest here at the center of the park, where the mists coalesce and then dance back out again amongst the trees. Many small rivulets of water feed into an indent atop a large collection of boulders. As the water overflows the pool, it spills across the sides of the stone to trickle down the steps of the rock formation. Smaller pools are formed as it cascades over the rock until at last the rivulets are reunited into a single small stream which finds its way home to the larger river. Delicate flowering moss has grown over the stones of this centerpiece of the forest, and a small family of larks takes delight in bathing beneath the tiny waterfalls and mossy pools, even as the melodic chirping of other birds wafts through the tree branches all around.  A stack of rocks and a closed door are here.

A grove of young, green-needled pine trees surrounds a small meadow of vibrantly flowering rhododendrons. Hues of bright pink, red, and white create a stunning contrast against the darker grey bark of the pines. Brighter green hemlock trees spread to catch the sunlight, which, in turn, shelter smaller stands of delicious salmonberry bushes, airy leather ferns, and poignantly fragranced sorrels that thrive on the compost of the forest floor. Soft haircap moss covers the river stone-lined path, dew from the mist collecting on it like pollen on bees. The distant wash of rushing water quietly filters through the peaceful air that hangs heavily saturated with moisture.  A stack of rocks is here.

Lthe asks in Leuian, "any suggestions about terms of office?"

Tazzie nuzzles Crax.

Crax nuzzles Tiruna.

Tiruna raises her hand.

Crax nuzzles Tazzie.

Mel says in Leuian, "Dont forget the part where they hook the iron shackles to your leg the moment you are voted into the positon of Lawmaster"

Lthe says in Leuian, "Tiruna"

Mel stares at Tiruna.

Tiruna stands up.

Tiruna smiles sweetly at Mel.

Hott listens intently.

Tiruna says in Leuian, "I'm thinking what we've done is good enough"

Tiruna says in Leuian, "except, I know the CM's were for life"

Lthe says to Tiruna in Leuian, "yes, I was told CMs served until they dropped"

Tiruna says in Leuian, "I think they should be 12 months"

Lthe grins.

Hott raises his hand.

Lthe asks Tiruna in Leuian, "12 for CMs, six for the rest?"

Tiruna nods up and down.

Tiruna says in Leuian, "my reasoning is"

Tiruna says in Leuian, "since the Khatyr comes from the CM's"

Tiruna says in Leuian, "at least we have one election without turning over everyone"

Tiruna says in Leuian, "and"

Tiruna says in Leuian, "as I've been a CM forever"

Tiruna says in Leuian, "it get's hard"

Lthe nods to Tiruna.

Mel grins at Tiruna.

Mel snickers.

Tiruna says in Leuian, "and it's even harder to decide when to step down"

Lthe says in Leuian, "That's a decent point.  AS it stands, CMs have to decide to step down themselves"

Tiruna says in Leuian, "you get to feeling nothing will work if you step down"

Tiruna says in Leuian, "and that's just not true"

Mel nods to Tiruna.

Lthe nods.

Tiruna says in Leuian, "the Pride will go on"

Mel says in Leuian, "Worked fine after i stepped down"

Tiruna says in Leuian, "so I really really feel there should be a time limit on CM's"

Tiruna says in Leuian, "as for your other question on Khatyr duties, I feel it's fine as it is"

Tiruna says in Leuian, "done"

You whisper to Lthe in Leuian.

Hott says in Leuian, "are we not thinking for pride"

Tiruna shakes her head from side to side.

Hott says in Leuian, "if a clawmaster does not know when to resign then should not be one"

Hott says in Leuian, "done"

Lthe ponders the meaning of the universe for a moment.

Hott sits down.

Hott says in Leuian, "ponder that"

Tiruna says in Leuian, "I couldn't quite translate it"

Tiruna nuzzles Hott.

Tiruna says in Leuian, "and I got to get it right for the minutes"

Tchori says in Leuian, "if they arent wise enough to know when to step down.. they likely shouldnt be in the position in the first place"

Tiruna exclaims in Leuian, "that's the second statement!"

Tchori grins.

Lthe nods.

Tiruna says in Leuian, "I got that clear and agree whole heartedly"
wh to tir the one thing a clawmaster is something about..is status?

Tiruna beams.

Kandil nods to Hott.

Tiruna says in Leuian, "it certainly isn't, thanks,  Hott"

Tiruna nuzzles Hott.

Hott says in Leuian, "gad"

Shaleu smiles.

Tazzie nuzzles Shaleu.

Hott hugs Shaleu.

Shaleu sits down next to Tiruna.

Lthe says in Leuian, "All right, we have a slight disagreement here.  One way to go is to set terms for all the offices, and the other is to exempt CMs from such limits"

Tiruna says in Leuian, "I will go with whatever the Pride decides, I thought it might be a time for a change"

Kandil says to Hott in Leuian, "your seat is to small for most, your stuck with it"

Crax raises his hand.

Mel says to Hott in Leuian, "Nope your stuck with it sorry "

Tiruna says in Leuian, "the Pride is a living breathing entity"

Tiruna says in Leuian, "and sometimes we get stuck"

Crax stands up.

Tazzie leans on Tiruna.

Tiruna nuzzles Tazzie.

Timble swishes his tail slowly across the ground as he turns another page.

Crax says in Leuian, "responsibilty over others in some things can be a heavy burden...to have to carry that burden for life is difficult...people need a break and other need to be involved so all treat each other with respect knowing what they've been through"

Crax says in Leuian, "i think term limits would help that"

Kandil raises her hand.

Crax says in Leuian, "just my opinion"

Hott says in Leuian, "ye want my term"

Crax sits down.

Crax says to Hott in Leuian, "nope"

Lthe says in Leuian, "Kandil"

Kandil stands up.

Kandil asks in Leuian, "well i think we have a great turn out tonight, why dont we just put it to a quick vote?"

Lthe raises an eyebrow.

Lthe asks Kandil in Leuian, "you want to do that now?"

Tiruna says in Leuian, "might I say one more thing"

Kandil says in Leuian, "we can or push ittill next week if the Pride decides"

Tiruna says in Leuian, "before that"

Kandil shrugs.

Lthe nods to Tiruna.

Kandil sits down.

Tiruna stands up.

Tiruna says in Leuian, "having terms does two things"

Tiruna says in Leuian, "one"

Hott says in Leuian, "not now "

Tiruna says in Leuian, "it allows the clawmaster to recommit to their position within the pride"

Tchori says in Leuian, "on this point.. i wish to press that we are NOT like other prides.. we live outside leuia.. among lakar.. so what we can mentor and teach will go far into how a leuian may adjust and survive HERE"

Tiruna says in Leuian, "somewhere else"

Tazzie smiles at Shaleu.

Tiruna says in Leuian, "your mentoring will prolly be different than if you were a brand new khit"

Hott nods.

Tiruna says in Leuian, "but you need to be mentored to where we are and what we face here"

Lthe nods to Tiruna.

Kandil says to Lthe in Leuian, "perfect solution"

Lthe chuckles.

Tiruna nods up and down.

Lthe says in Leuian, "no such thing"

Kandil says to Lthe in Leuian, "dont say that.. shhhhhh"

Lthe says in Leuian, "All right, only two more points"

Tiruna smiles and whispers to Hott , well she is the Lawmaster.

Lthe says in Leuian, "One that concerns me is the relation of LM to CM"

Tiruna nods up and down.

Hott listens intently.

Lthe says in Leuian, "Reading the sections of the Diaries concerning Outcasting and Shunning, they suggest that the duties of LM and CM are quite distinct in such cases"

Tiruna nods up and down.

Hott nods.

Lthe says in Leuian, "The LM is mostly a finder of fact, one who tries to figure out exactly what has happened"

Lthe says in Leuian, "The CMs are judges in such cases, deciding if what has been done is wrong, and if punishment is needed"

Hott nods.

Lthe says in Leuian, "My feeling is that this suggests the LM should not also be a CM"

Hott says in Leuian, "never"

Hott's stomach growls.

Lthe smiles at Hott.

Tiruna raises her hand.

Lthe says in Leuian, "And I'd like to include a provision to that effect in the Guidelines"

Tiruna says in Leuian, "but I been here since the diaries were accepted by our Pride"

Shaleu bows head and she cover her face hiding her giggles.

Tiruna says in Leuian, "at that time it was said the LM doesn't necessarily have to be a CM , but could be"

Tiruna pokes Shaleu.

Tiruna says in Leuian, "I agree with Lthe"

Tazzie giggles at Shaleu.

Shaleu winces.

Tiruna says in Leuian, "I think the LM shouldn't be a CM"

Mel ponders the meaning of the universe for a moment.

Hott listens intently.

Crax says in Leuian, "to re iterate what Tchori said...the diaries such as they are  were written by a lakar visiting leuia...I don't see how they can truely aid us in many things here in Spur when we need deal with more Lakar than kyn...we need ideas for our survival here.."

Crax says in Leuian, "not what our Kyn did 100 years ago home"

Crax shrugs.

Kandil asks Dac in Leuian, "why yah way back there?"

Crax says in Leuian, "lthe of course it does    you keep referenceing the diaries....we're not in leuia"

Dac says in Leuian, "As much as I also agree we live in different circumstances than the times the Diaries were written in...but if we take the lessons learned from the Diaries and apply the principles, the Diaries still have relevance."

Dac stands up.
You see Dac move up another 5 UDs!

>[Commodore Island Park.]

A grove of young, green-needled pine trees surrounds a small meadow of vibrantly flowering rhododendrons. Hues of bright pink, red, and white create a stunning contrast against the darker grey bark of the pines. Brighter green hemlock trees spread to catch the sunlight, which, in turn, shelter smaller stands of delicious salmonberry bushes, airy leather ferns, and poignantly fragranced sorrels that thrive on the compost of the forest floor. Soft haircap moss covers the river stone-lined path, dew from the mist collecting on it like pollen on bees. The distant wash of rushing water quietly filters through the peaceful air that hangs heavily saturated with moisture.  A stack of rocks is here.

Amidst the towering trees and verdant mid level bushes, several smaller cabins blend into the surrounding park. The peaked roofs of the cabins bear the familiar carving as seen on most of the village homes and their small porches sport plantings of flowering wild roses and perky daisies accented with the fronds of leather ferns and shelf fungus.  A closed chiseled petrified redwood door, a closed arched slate grey granite boulder door, a closed salt stained cargo hatch, a closed vine etched glass door, and a decaying pile of planks are here.
