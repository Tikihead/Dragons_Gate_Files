A grove of young, green-needled pine trees surrounds a small meadow of vibrantly flowering rhododendrons. Hues of bright pink, red, and white create a stunning contrast against the darker grey bark of the pines. Brighter green hemlock trees spread to catch the sunlight, which, in turn, shelter smaller stands of delicious salmonberry bushes, airy leather ferns, and poignantly fragranced sorrels that thrive on the compost of the forest floor. Soft haircap moss covers the river stone-lined path, dew from the mist collecting on it like pollen on bees. The distant wash of rushing water quietly filters through the peaceful air that hangs heavily saturated with moisture.  A stack of rocks is here.

Far above the forest floor, the looming trees' canopy shades the park's paths. Every few feet a break in the leaves lights a fortunate fern or clover patch that languishes in the gift from the heavens. A giant among oaks, dwarfed by the mighty conifers enjoys such a boon.  Its twisted branches decry the battle to survive beneath the taller competitors. Nestled in the crotches of the oak branches, beautiful orchids thrive and bloom despite the weather, causing many of the villagers to believe that the goddess herself has adopted the oak as one of her protected monuments. The villagers have placed benches made of koy around the oak that complement the park without detracting from its natural beauty.  An ancient gnarled oak tree, some fragrant amber orchids, a beautiful hand-carved koy wood bench, a stack of rocks, and an ivy covered sandstone arch are here.

A soothing peace has settled over the forest here at the center of the park, where the mists coalesce and then dance back out again amongst the trees. Many small rivulets of water feed into an indent atop a large collection of boulders. As the water overflows the pool, it spills across the sides of the stone to trickle down the steps of the rock formation. Smaller pools are formed as it cascades over the rock until at last the rivulets are reunited into a single small stream which finds its way home to the larger river. Delicate flowering moss has grown over the stones of this centerpiece of the forest, and a small family of larks takes delight in bathing beneath the tiny waterfalls and mossy pools, even as the melodic chirping of other birds wafts through the tree branches all around.  A stack of rocks and a closed door are here.

The village homes snuggle closer together as the path nears the town center, and eventually widens to include a few communal buildings and a burbling fountain to the west.  The village bustles with life at all hours. Towering trees spread their branches over the buildings, as if embracing them.    A stack of rocks and an overgrown back alley are here.

Amidst the towering trees and verdant mid level bushes, several smaller cabins blend into the surrounding park. The peaked roofs of the cabins bear the familiar carving as seen on most of the village homes and their small porches sport plantings of flowering wild roses and perky daisies accented with the fronds of leather ferns and shelf fungus.  A closed chiseled petrified redwood door, a closed arched slate grey granite boulder door, a closed salt stained cargo hatch, a closed vine etched glass door, and a decaying pile of planks are here.
