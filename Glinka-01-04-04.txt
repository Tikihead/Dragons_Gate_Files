A small statuette lies in a niche against the north wall, resting atop a stone pedestal. It appears that it might have been a female figure, although it is so damaged that any solid assessment is impossible. A kneeling stone sits before the statue, covered with a few dark brown stains that might just be blood.  A rusty steel long sword, a straw hat, a blue and white striped plate, a pair of dusty brown leather boots with holes, a dirty tuft of fur, a rusty steel long sword, a giant silver fork, an iridescent black crow's feather, a cotton tunic, and a tattered wool shawl are here.

A small statuette lies in a niche against the north wall, resting atop a stone pedestal. It appears that it might have been a female figure, although it is so damaged that any solid assessment is impossible. A kneeling stone sits before the statue, covered with a few dark brown stains that might just be blood.  A straw hat, a blue and white striped plate, a pair of dusty brown leather boots with holes, a dirty tuft of fur, a rusty steel long sword, a giant silver fork, an iridescent black crow's feather, a cotton tunic, a tattered wool shawl, a rusty steel long sword, a closed fragile steelwood chest, a handmade colorful glass bottle, an iron chainmail coif, a silver corkscrew, some worn buckskin archer's gloves, a two-handed steel scythe, a light cloth jerkin, and a straw hat are here.

[Forest stream.]

The path ends here as it comes upon the steep banks of a forest stream.  A wooden bridge, in surprisingly good repair, crosses the stream. The skeletal remains of some fish litter the stream bank and nosing about you notice some large pawprints.  A wooden bridge and some skeletal fish remains are here.

This area is illuminated.
You see the 1st ferret (wearing a small gold collar).
In the area are Jiedos the Secian (a ferret upon his left shoulder), Khalifa the Noble Leuian, and Kuki the Novice Oog-ra.
Obvious paths: north* southeast.

A small stream runs noisily under the two bridges spanning the ravine. A number of the brunt oaks still stand about, memorials to the forest this once was. A number of small saplings dot the ground between the black trunks. Between the stream bank and oaks, a small path of four-leaf-clover shaped stones weave a windy path through the forest.  A stone bridge, a wooden bridge, a clump of wildgrass, and a small winding stone path are here.

A number of darkened and burnt trunks still stand around the path. A few patches of undergrowth have started to spot the earth about, trying to cover the desolation. Small four-leaf-clover shaped stones form a small path through the darkened trunks. The soft sound of running water echoes in from the west.  A small winding stone path is here.

A fine haze of dust hovers over the remains of the Silver Owl Inn. Through the fallen timbers and memories of lives lost, one can see brilliant green sprouts reaching for sunlight. A tiny songbird perches on an old stick of furniture poking through the rubble, singing sweetly to herald new life and hope. A small winding path of stones placed in the shape of four leaf clovers winds itself through the forest.  A small winding stone pathway and a charred ancient steelwood tree are here.

A small path, its stones in the shape of four leaf clovers, winds its way through the sparse remains of a once dense undergrowth. Blackened limbs crunch underfoot beneath piles of moist, newly fallen leaves.  A small winding stone pathway and a broken and cracked steelwood tree are here.

The path of four leaf clove shaped flagstones leads past a small clean shack and into a well formed tunnel through the thorn bushes to the east and the Caersech to the west. The small shack is set back from the road, its walls built of a whitewashed birch. A sturdy corral, filled with well-fed horses, stands to the left of the shack. A matched pair of dapple grays stand in front of the shack waiting to take their human baggage to their destination. To the left of the door, behind a small paned window, a beautiful Fir Elf female takes coin and in return, with a charming smile, directs those who have paid their fare into the waiting room.  A small shack, a freshly painted sign, a notice of non-refund, and a small winding stone pathway are here.

Contrasting starkly with the ashes of the forest and brush is a freshly constructed set of stairs that wraps itself about the large tree. The intricate woodwork that decorates the steps is of the finest quality, as if in parody to the blackened destruction of the hedges and brambles around the base of the trunk. Bright green leaves of clover have begun springing up through the ashy soil in conjunction with soft moss to lend a durable cushion to this well-traveled spot.  Some steps circling the tree, a freshly painted wooden sign, a healthy green patch of clover, a flowing marble fountain, and some clover shaped stones are here.

The latticework surrounding and covering the spiral staircase is finely crafted. The intertwining beams seem to weave a delicate pattern above you, accenting the view of the forest floor. The view of burned trees and the scorched structure of the fallen inn spoils the otherwise wondrous scene.  Some steps circling the tree are here.

Two freshly carved regal elven warrior statues guard either side of this sturdy landing near the top of the impressive staircase. The silent sentinels stare out into the charred forest far below, grimly watching the destroyed landscape of blackened, skeletal trees.  Some steps circling the tree are here.

Four sturdy walls and a roof of woven branches enclose this small tavern. From the forest floor, winding their way around the trunk of the Mother Tree, a set of intricately railed steps serve as the entrance and exit of the town of Treehaven. Strangers arriving at the top of the steps find themselves under the watchful eye of patrons seated at tables positioned about the light, airy room. A set of oak steps lead up to the new Council chambers.  An ivory inlaid pine bar, a wooden stool, a long weathered wooden bench, a long musty wooden table, some steps circling the tree, some freshly crafted oak steps, an open door, a paper covered posting board, and a gilt framed painting on the wall are here.
