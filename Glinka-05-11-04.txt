The murals on the walls make this room appear to be sitting on the side of a mountain overlooking a verdant glen. Majestic eagles soar high overhead, the view so real you swear you can hear their cries. Huge moss-covered stones are placed about the room to enhance the feel. From one of them a small burbling trickle of water fills a hollow basin carved into the floor.  A bright onyx archway is here.

                                    Visualization #1 is:
The towering trees of the forest begin their ascension of the large mountain seen from the open plains of New South Lake. The root holds are precarious, as the mountain's face is especially steep on the northern side. The muddy path concludes in front of a sheer stone wall covered with verdant patches of green moss. A numbing breeze blows outward from the depths a massive cavern mouth, as if the mountain itself was exhaling ice-chilled breath. Deep-cut symbols grace the sides of the cavern entrance. They appear to be recently completed, as time, water, and weather have not yet dulled the sharp lines of the cuts.

                                    Visualization #2 is:
Four sturdy walls and a roof of woven branches enclose this small tavern. From the forest floor, winding their way around the trunk of the Mother Tree, a set of intricately railed steps serve as the entrance and exit of the town of Treehaven. Strangers arriving at the top of the steps find themselves under the watchful eye of patrons seated at tables positioned about the light, airy room. A set of oak steps lead up to the new Council chambers.

                                    Visualization #3 is:
An abundant gallery of paintings depicting sacrifices and hold offerings to their god suspend from crooked iron nails. Resting beside each painting, cold black iron braziers appear to hold burned blood and bone. A few charred, blackened pieces can be found in them. Several iron chains hang along the walls of the sacrificial chamber. Along the floor, intricately placed colored slate tiles are coated in dust covered dried blood. Centering the room is a raised platform accessible through a flight of stairs. Upon this raised formation rests an altar inlaid with rows and rows of teeth.

Nature is in its full glory here along this trail. Birds sing as they fly from branch to branch on the trees that line the trail. A rabbit hops out across the trail and quickly darts into the bushes on the other side. Breathing the fresh air you feel greatly invigorated on your trek down this path.

Tall healthy-looking trees stand to the north and east. The path of the road to the north disappears into the forest. Following the road south leads to eastern housing and the east gate of Spur. Small rocks and stones litter the trail making it difficult to walk without tripping.

The splintered remains of a dilapidated shack block you from exploring this area any further, and you are forced to turn back the way you came.

Rats and rodents scurry around the hovels looking for something to eat. You hear what you think are more of the furry creatures moving behind the piles of junk.

Thankfully the air here is a little clearer, although the sights are not any better. A few feet away two hungry Thugians are fighting over the corpse of a dead rabid dog. They stop long enough to glance your way, look back at the dog's corpse, and then stare thoughtfully at each other - well, as thoughtful as a Thugian can be. They lumber to their feet and start heading your way, but halfway to you they start fighting with each other. You decide this is a good moment to move along quickly.

The ramshackle huts give way to patched and faded tents along this portion of the path. Small cooking fires burn in front of each tent, and your nose catches a truly disgusting odor coming from the pots set over the fires.

A large, well-kept gate is cut into the immense wall that surrounds Spur. Although everything else has fallen into disrepair, it is evident that security is still of foremost importance to the Governor. Uniformed guards patrol high above, conscientiously glancing down to assure peace is being kept along this well-traveled road. A crotchety old man leans against the wall, just out of view of the guards, counting the coin he has thus far appropriated this fine day.  An open iron gate and a closed thick stone door are here.

Tall black spires rise from the building that towers above the hedge skirting the southern portion of Eastern Spur Road.

A large, stubborn dog has resolutely planted himself in the middle of the road. His master pulls on the rope around his neck, then pushes his backside firmly. It is quite apparent that nothing short of a nice meaty bone is going to make him budge. Those who travel this path keep their heads lowered and ignore the comical scene. A gnawing hunger and aching muscles after a long day of hard work keep most from paying attention to even the simple things around them.

The crowd travels in both directions, moving with definite purpose. Downtrodden and of modest means, most wear the tattered clothing of the poor.

A large double gate opens on the south side of the road, leading down an old cobbled path. Large wagons, small ox carts, and in some cases old buckboards make the turn toward the cemetery carrying their precious cargo to its final resting place.

Huge, colorful silk banners float proudly in the breeze from the giant stone arch that provides passage to the reopened Spurian Arena. The gladiators that once sat dejected and forlorn against the arch now stand proudly and alert, polishing their swords to the highest sheen, and adjusting their helms and breastplates. A long line of potential competitors and audience members alike is beginning to form, the last of whom glance uneasily in the direction of the looming cemetary before turning their attention back on the huge arena ahead.

A colorfully clad flerian calls out the odds on newly sentenced criminals as they are marched slowly by heading towards their fate in the arena.

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.   A flowing white marble fountain, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a marble statue of a Human, a carved marble statue of a Dragon, a rosewood sign, a small jagged cobblestone crack, a welcome mat, a giant crumbled maw, a massive black crack in the ground, a pile of smelly trash, and some brilliant red and yellow gloves are here.

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.   A flowing white marble fountain, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a marble statue of a Human, a carved marble statue of a Dragon, a rosewood sign, a small jagged cobblestone crack, a welcome mat, a giant crumbled maw, a massive black crack in the ground, a pile of smelly trash, and some brilliant red and yellow gloves are here.

Atop the fountain is an intricately carved Secian who appears to be dancing with the water as it splashes around her. Set in the marble base is a small plaque that reads, "For those who have gone before us." Many stand for a moment as they pass this way, giving thanks for the gift of life that is given by both the apple tree and the Secians of long ago. Large piles of dirt and broken stone lay on either side of the street as workmen ready the east and west alleys for expansion.  A street lantern, a Secian etched moonsilver door, a pair of open silver forged swinging doors, and a sign above the doors are here.

Through the gate lies the city of Spur, the major center of trade and civilization on the plains. The dusty road leading through the gates is well traveled, and walls of the city are in good repair. A small shack sits to the west of the road, during most times of the day a dusty coach can be seen waiting in front, its horses stomping with impatience to be gone. To the right of the door is a small window, its opening covered with metal bars. An old man, missing most of his teeth, waits patiently for the travelers to pay their fare, and then directs them into the waiting area. On the east side of the road a billowing multicolored tent has been erected, the hustle and bustle of merchants and customers can be seen coming and going at all times of the day.
