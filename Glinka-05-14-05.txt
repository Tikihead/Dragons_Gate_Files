A large wooden sign reading, "Welcome to Memorial Creations!" stands on the side of the path. Several different memorial designs sit below the enormous sign. A beautiful statue of a tall human, an intricately carved memorial stone, and the carefully carved bust of a Hithual stand sentinel. A heavy wooden door leads to the entrance of this large establishment.  An open heavy wooden door is here.

A Ranger slides past you and disappears into a large wagon. The bag he carries wiggles as he moves. Through the trees, children can be seen hunting for berries and nuts. Their dearest wish is to find enough to be allowed special entrance into the wagon to feed the cute animals. A variety of noises, a cacophony of animals, resounds from the brightly colored wagon. Beside it, a makeshift stall houses a pair of black mares covered in light green blankets, contentedly munching oats from feedbags.  A glowing crystal street lantern and an open brightly painted mahogany wagon door are here.

The sounds of animals fill your ears as various species speak back and forth to each other in exotic tongues. Various large wooden crates and cages are set upon the floor, while smaller glass containers line shelving against the back wall of the wagon, each housing a single animal waiting for adoption. A bright green parrot perches atop a branch of a small potted tree, growling menacingly and barking at any who come near its territory. It then squawks, winks one eye and repeats, "Just kidding, just kidding."  A small gnarled potted tree and an open brightly painted mahogany wagon door are here.

The ground begins to slope slightly upward and the field of daisies slowly gives way to another field of golden grass. Children laugh and giggle as they roll down the hill, gaining speed and disappearing into a patch of high grass. A neatly paved cobblestone walkway meanders up the incline towards a small cottage which sits at the top of the rise. The windows of the cottage, despite all attempts to keep it clean, are smudged with the fingerprints of passers-by who have pressed themselves up to the glass to gain a better view before walking through the door.  A large wagon is here.

People excitedly pass by, glancing down at the festival map purchased at the souvenirs shop while discussing the next shop to visit. To the southeast, the top of a deep blue tent can be seen through the gaps of the trees which line the cobblestone pathway. Children gleefully skip around the meandering adults, plucking flowers from flower beds and tooting on shiny horns with ribbons before darting towards the candy shop.  A blooming flower bed and a silver ribboned satin tent are here.

Fragrant, ribbon tied, roses, daisies and tulips are carefully placed along a long pine fence, which separates a beautiful grassy park with a tall muddy hill. Several granite benches are placed sporadically in the carefully manicured grass. A small pond resides in the center of the park, and many partake in its fresh water to take a quick bath and remove the mud from the hill above. A tall arch, carved with the likenesses of forest creatures leads the way to the fun to be had on the muddy hill beyond.  A glowing crystal street lantern and a tall carved archway are here.

As the wind blows softly through the trees, a small bird flitters from branch to branch high above. The squawk of a bird in flight and the chattering of a small animal making his home among the local brush is all that disturbs this serene location. A golden glow radiates from tiny candles in the windows of a small stone cottage. A trail of blue iris leads into the abode, and stacks of firewood, waiting for the colder weather, rest to the right side of the entryway.

Looking closely you can make out names of the many long gone who enjoyed an ale or two in this tavern. Smoke billows to the top of the cottage, letting itself out through a small window.

An old gray haired woman sits on a giant rocking chair rocking back and forth slowly, knitting a colorful afghan while she sings a quiet song. The notes fall and rise as the fire quietly pops and crackles. The woman's pale blue eyes twinkle as she greets her customers with a wink and a smile. Her husband stands behind a beautiful glass case and passes his hand above the beautiful trinkets within. With a gentle smile, he inquires if you are interested in looking at any of his work.  An open ornate pale blue applewood door is here.

Old cobblestone pathways branch off in many directions, winding through this enchanting village. The thick boughs of trees cover the path in a comforting hug. A soft glow warms the earth as the heavens' celestial orb casts a halo of through the treetops. Bells chime quietly in remembrance of those long gone.

A gnarled willow tree stands like a towering sentinel over a small candy striped cottage. The tree's long, languid branches wave in the soft breeze. From up close you can make out the dulcet scent ofpeppermint, cinnamon, spices, and chocolate. A misty trail of white smoke billows steadily in rings from a stone chimney. As the sweet smell intoxicates the air, a small circle of children giggle and dance around a small fountain, splashing each other with its cool water.  An open pink gumdrop shaped door, a glowing crystal street lantern, and a multicolored pointed paper party hat are here.

Children line up anxiously in front of a large glass display counter featuring various sugary treats. A pudgy, jovial human woman stands behind the counter, passing out small multicolored gum drops to outstretched, grass-stained hands. A secian flitters from the backroom carrying a tray of freshly baked chocolate chip cookies. The scent is tantalizing, causing a young Thugian child to drool helplessly. A tiny go-blin-al child jumps unsuccessfully in front of a tall shelf laden with a rainbow colored assortment of candy in attempts to grab a large green go-blin-al shaped marshmallow. An immature drag-al greedily cups his hands over a massive pile of chocolate gold coins, telling anyone who will listen, "I'm RICH!"  A glass counter and an open pink gumdrop shaped door are here.

The cobblestone path winds its way between lush trees that bloom tiny white flowers. A gentle breeze blows through the area, causing the buds to shake and flutter softly onto the ground. Boisterous laughter can be heard echoing from within two large cottages which causes the pathway to fork to the southwest and southeast. Above one door, a sign reads "The Bounty Bar," and above the other there is a sign that reads "The Bounty Dining Hall." A few children lean lazily against one of the building structure, sipping on glasses of raspberry fizz and chocolate milk as they wait for their parents. An adolescent drag-al, grinning from ear to ear, darts out of the tavern holding a bottle of champagne, grabs his friend and drags him quickly to the southeast.  A pot of flowering red and white geraniums, a barrel shaped wooden door, and a paneled mahogany door are here.

Towering trees full of leaves sway as gust of wind moves through their branches. A scampering squirrel hops from branch to branch, hanging tightly on to a newly found treasure.

A sign outside the tent shows a beautiful creation being etched upon a Thugian's arm, the words above the pictorial read, "Tattoos."   A rich black velvet flag with tatoo designs, some glowing diamond lanterns, and an open deep black velvet tent are here.

Black and silver stripes cover the walls of this airy tent. Warm air radiates around you from slow burning vanilla scented candles resting on tall wrought iron posts. The golden light produced bounces off the silver stripes on the tent walls. Several large backless sofas reside around the tent, for customers to lounge upon while waiting for service.  A deep black velvet tent flap and an open glimmering beaded curtain are here.

Towering trees full of leaves sway as gust of wind moves through their branches. A scampering squirrel hops from branch to branch, hanging tightly on to a newly found treasure. A gentle wind sighs a slow, lingering song above. The path winds itself towards the entrance of a black velvet tent. A sign outside the tent shows a beautiful creation being etched upon a Thugian's arm, the words above the pictorial read, "Tattoos."   A rich black velvet flag with tatoo designs, some glowing diamond lanterns, and an open deep black velvet tent are here.

The cobblestone path winds its way between lush trees that bloom tiny white flowers. A gentle breeze blows through the area, causing the buds to shake and flutter softly onto the ground. Boisterous laughter can be heard echoing from within two large cottages which causes the pathway to fork to the southwest and southeast. Above one door, a sign reads "The Bounty Bar," and above the other there is a sign that reads "The Bounty Dining Hall." A few children lean lazily against one of the building structure, sipping on glasses of raspberry fizz and chocolate milk as they wait for their parents. An adolescent drag-al, grinning from ear to ear, darts out of the tavern holding a bottle of champagne, grabs his friend and drags him quickly to the southeast.  A pot of flowering red and white geraniums, a barrel shaped wooden door, a paneled mahogany door, and a silver ribboned paper horn are here.

Old cobblestone pathways branch off in many directions, winding through this enchanting village. The thick boughs of trees cover the path in a comforting hug. A soft glow warms the earth as the heavens' celestial orb casts a halo of through the treetops. Bells chime quietly in remembrance of those long gone.  A glowing crystal street lantern, a carved white marble block, some flowing multicolored silk streamers, a beautifully carved white marble bench, and a flower covered marble arch are here.

[Spur Gateway.]

Travelers from Rathan to the northwest, and the Trade Route to the south, converge at Spur's west gate. Guards posted on the ground give those seeking to enter the city a cursory once-over. Their lack of interest shows that anyone approaching has already been observed from above for some time. A grate in the ground loosens mud from wagon wheels and hooves before they pass through the gate, helping to keep the streets of Spur fairly clean.  An open giant black iron gate, a giant green oak tree, a small blue pool, a thick oak grate over the pool, a polished stone marker, a flaming glass covered memorial candle, a flower covered marble arch, and a flaming glass covered memorial candle are here.

The relative safety inside Spur is a comfort to those returning from the fields and mountains. To those leaving, a massive wall of defense around the city lies ahead. Archer towers beside the gate overlook the wall, offering a painful welcome to would-be invaders. Several guards on foot patrol pass and disappear behind a thick, bluesteel banded steelwood door. Wall road stretches to the south, a wide passage between the city wall and several large buildings.  An open iron gate, an open thick stone door, a street lantern, and a flaming glass covered memorial candle are here.

Row after row of bunks fill the enormous main room of the western guard barracks. A small chest sits at the foot of each of the bunks, holding clothing and other personal items. The simple but efficient furniture complements the neat bedding and clean walls and floors.  An open thick stone door is here.
