The chipped bark path widens to encompass a broad square between the peaked roofs of the village homes, the larger storefronts, and several communal buildings that all surround a magnificent fountain crafted from local sandstone. The multi-tiered fountain flows with pure, clean springwater and provides seating around its broad base.  The towering trees surround the village, enclosing the square in a living frame.  To the west is a sturdy building with its door perpetually ajar. A line of Leuian children trots off towards the north, bearing their lessons. The faint ding of nautical bells flows in on the breeze from the northwest.   A flowing gold-flecked sandstone fountain and a dirty oak-handled spade are here.

This area is illuminated.
In the area are Snowball the Leuian (seated), Crax the Noble Leuian, Stormy the Leuian (lying down), Runningdeer the Leuian, Dathis the Noble Leuian (seated), and Pantherro the Leuian (lying down).
Obvious paths: north* northeast* east* southeast* south* southwest* west*.

The chipped bark path widens to encompass a broad square between the peaked roofs of the village homes, the larger storefronts, and several communal buildings that all surround a magnificent fountain crafted from local sandstone. The multi-tiered fountain flows with pure, clean springwater and provides seating around its broad base.  The towering trees surround the village, enclosing the square in a living frame.  To the west is a sturdy building with its door perpetually ajar. A line of Leuian children trots off towards the north, bearing their lessons. The faint ding of nautical bells flows in on the breeze from the northwest.   A flowing gold-flecked sandstone fountain and a dirty oak-handled spade are here.

A soothing peace has settled over the forest here at the center of the park, where the mists coalesce and then dance back out again amongst the trees. Many small rivulets of water feed into an indent atop a large collection of boulders. As the water overflows the pool, it spills across the sides of the stone to trickle down the steps of the rock formation. Smaller pools are formed as it cascades over the rock until at last the rivulets are reunited into a single small stream which finds its way home to the larger river. Delicate flowering moss has grown over the stones of this centerpiece of the forest, and a small family of larks takes delight in bathing beneath the tiny waterfalls and mossy pools, even as the melodic chirping of other birds wafts through the tree branches all around.  A stack of rocks and a closed door are here.

A grove of young, green-needled pine trees surrounds a small meadow of vibrantly flowering rhododendrons. Hues of bright pink, red, and white create a stunning contrast against the darker grey bark of the pines. Brighter green hemlock trees spread to catch the sunlight, which, in turn, shelter smaller stands of delicious salmonberry bushes, airy leather ferns, and poignantly fragranced sorrels that thrive on the compost of the forest floor. Soft haircap moss covers the river stone-lined path, dew from the mist collecting on it like pollen on bees. The distant wash of rushing water quietly filters through the peaceful air that hangs heavily saturated with moisture.  A stack of rocks is here.

Far above the forest floor, the looming trees' canopy shades the park's paths. Every few feet a break in the leaves lights a fortunate fern or clover patch that languishes in the gift from the heavens. A giant among oaks, dwarfed by the mighty conifers enjoys such a boon.  Its twisted branches decry the battle to survive beneath the taller competitors. Nestled in the crotches of the oak branches, beautiful orchids thrive and bloom despite the weather, causing many of the villagers to believe that the goddess herself has adopted the oak as one of her protected monuments. The villagers have placed benches made of koy around the oak that complement the park without detracting from its natural beauty.  An ancient gnarled oak tree, some fragrant amber orchids, a beautiful hand-carved koy wood bench, a stack of rocks, and an ivy covered sandstone arch are here.

The village homes snuggle closer together as the path nears the town center, and eventually widens to include a few communal buildings and a burbling fountain to the west.  The village bustles with life at all hours. Towering trees spread their branches over the buildings, as if embracing them.    A stack of rocks and an overgrown back alley are here.

This area is illuminated.

[Village.]

The chipped bark path widens to encompass a broad square between the peaked roofs of the village homes, the larger storefronts, and several communal buildings that all surround a magnificent fountain crafted from local sandstone. The multi-tiered fountain flows with pure, clean springwater and provides seating around its broad base.  The towering trees surround the village, enclosing the square in a living frame.  To the west is a sturdy building with its door perpetually ajar. A line of Leuian children trots off towards the north, bearing their lessons. The faint ding of nautical bells flows in on the breeze from the northwest.   A flowing gold-flecked sandstone fountain and a dirty oak-handled spade are here.

This area is illuminated.
In the area are Talishia the Leuian, Lthe the Leuian (seated), Snowball the Leuian (seated), Crax the Noble Leuian, Rutferd the Leuian, Stormy the Leuian (seated), Runningdeer the Leuian, Tchori the Leuian (seated), Shaleu the Leuian (seated), Dathis the Noble Leuian, and Pantherro the Leuian (seated).

[Village.]

The chipped bark path widens to encompass a broad square between the peaked roofs of the village homes, the larger storefronts, and several communal buildings that all surround a magnificent fountain crafted from local sandstone. The multi-tiered fountain flows with pure, clean springwater and provides seating around its broad base.  The towering trees surround the village, enclosing the square in a living frame.  To the west is a sturdy building with its door perpetually ajar. A line of Leuian children trots off towards the north, bearing their lessons. The faint ding of nautical bells flows in on the breeze from the northwest.   A flowing gold-flecked sandstone fountain and a dirty oak-handled spade are here.

This area is not illuminated.
In the area are Talishia the Leuian, Lthe the Leuian (seated), Snowball the Leuian (seated), Crax the Noble Leuian (seated), Kierra the Leuian (seated), Hott the Noble Leuian (seated), Stormy the Leuian (seated), Runningdeer the Leuian (seated), Tchori the Leuian (seated), Shaleu the Leuian (seated), Dathis the Noble Leuian (seated), and Pantherro the Leuian (seated).

The chipped bark path widens to encompass a broad square between the peaked roofs of the village homes, the larger storefronts, and several communal buildings that all surround a magnificent fountain crafted from local sandstone. The multi-tiered fountain flows with pure, clean springwater and provides seating around its broad base.  The towering trees surround the village, enclosing the square in a living frame.  To the west is a sturdy building with its door perpetually ajar. A line of Leuian children trots off towards the north, bearing their lessons. The faint ding of nautical bells flows in on the breeze from the northwest.   A flowing gold-flecked sandstone fountain and a dirty oak-handled spade are here.

info vis
                        You have visualized the following locations
                        -------------------------------------------

                                    Visualization #1 is:
Through the gate lies the city of Spur, the major center of trade and civilization on the plains. The dusty road leading through the gates is well traveled, and walls of the city are in good repair. A small shack sits to the west of the road, during most times of the day a dusty coach can be seen waiting in front, its horses stomping with impatience to be gone. To the right of the door is a small window, its opening covered with metal bars. An old man, missing most of his teeth, waits patiently for the travelers to pay their fare, and then directs them into the waiting area. On the east side of the road a billowing multicolored tent has been erected, the hustle and bustle of merchants and customers can be seen coming and going at all times of the day.

                                    Visualization #2 is:
Each corner of this square gives entrance to one of the fort's four business establishments. The bank is small, but adequate. The pawnshop and store will see to your buying and selling needs, and the Tarath Wayside Inn is open at all hours to provide shelter for residents and foreigners alike.

                                    Visualization #3 is:
Carefully winding its way up the base of the tree, and wrapping itself around the stairs, a flowering jasmine vine grows tall and lush. Dark scars from a past fire are almost hidden under tufts of fresh growth and moss. A large gap, nearly sixteen feet in distance, rests between the base of a set of stairs and the forest floor. A long moonsilver cord hangs down the side of the tree. If one pulls it, the long Elven rope will descend from above, allowing them to enter the great city of Treehaven. Bright green leaves of clover have begun springing up through the ashy soil in conjunction with soft moss to lend a durable cushion to this well-traveled spot.

Your active visualization is #2

The chipped bark path widens to encompass a broad square between the peaked roofs of the village homes, the larger storefronts, and several communal buildings that all surround a magnificent fountain crafted from local sandstone. The multi-tiered fountain flows with pure, clean springwater and provides seating around its broad base.  The towering trees surround the village, enclosing the square in a living frame.  To the west is a sturdy building with its door perpetually ajar. A line of Leuian children trots off towards the north, bearing their lessons. The faint ding of nautical bells flows in on the breeze from the northwest.   A flowing gold-flecked sandstone fountain and a dirty oak-handled spade are here.

Pantherro leans on Stormy and grin.

Snowball says in Leuian, "But if such is not the case, I officially resign as CM, as soon as is convenient, for I cannot guarantee my presence for a while yet."
Draejlen nuzzles Stormy.

Hott says in Leuian, "she gone now"
Hott sighs.

Snowball says in Leuian, "I just don't feel I can live up to the responsibility of Clawmaster, given my current situation."

Crax says to Dathis in Leuian, "find some java"
Dathis mumbles something beneath his breath.

Hott says in Leuian, "tis your decision not ours"

Snowball says in Leuian, "Please do seek me out if you feel like it, I just can't be here all the time like I was."

Snowball says in Leuian, "Done."

[Village.]

The chipped bark path widens to encompass a broad square between the peaked roofs of the village homes, the larger storefronts, and several communal buildings that all surround a magnificent fountain crafted from local sandstone. The multi-tiered fountain flows with pure, clean springwater and provides seating around its broad base.  The towering trees surround the village, enclosing the square in a living frame.  To the west is a sturdy building with its door perpetually ajar. A line of Leuian children trots off towards the north, bearing their lessons. The faint ding of nautical bells flows in on the breeze from the northwest.   A flowing gold-flecked sandstone fountain and a dirty oak-handled spade are here.

Tchori nods to Lthe.
Tchori blushes.

Lthe says in Leuian, "All right then.  It seems we will be filling two CM positions, to replace Snowball as well as Dac."

An immense, smoothed river boulder deposited by the river, eons ago, is imbedded in the soft loam of the forest floor and blocks the view of the river to the north. A few giant trees have grown bent around its rounded shape and an innovative homeowner has taken advantage of the resulting shelter. Built carefully among the trees in the lee of the rock, stands a magnificent example of the same peaked wooden beam homes that dot the entire forest. One fledgling tree pokes its head through a well-planned hole in the roof.  A pair of closed magnificent carved steelwood doors, a slippery downhill path, and a stack of rocks are here.

Weary sailors amble up the road after returning from a long voyage with their duffels thrown over their backs. Further down the road, the lighthouse is barely visible along the shoreline. Although difficult to see from here, its light shines like a beacon of hope to all the river. A giggling band of khits rushes towards the pier in hopes of catching a glimpse of some of the noble ships docked there. A group of Leuians sit near a few large rocks by the docks, mending nets and singing songs with one another as they wave to the returning fleets.

The tidy rows of well-tended yards lead down a slope to the edge of the island where the chipped bark path widens to accomodate the entrance to a large redwood building. The school buildling is square with a large grassy yard, perfectly situated for dozens of small Leuians to run around and practice their various drills and lessons. A tall white-furred Leuian stands just outside the main door and greets each student by name and with a respectful nod.  A large airy redwood school house is here.

The thick, tarred pylons of a long wooden pier poke through the surface of the calm lagoon interrupting the flat, mirrored reflection of the wharf storefronts and dry-docked ships. Here, the wheel hits the rub where the fleets converge, merchant ships load and unload, and individuals fish or relax. There are dozens of tables for display of wares awaiting the return of the fishing fleet. Behind each table lies a workspace open to a gully below for the disposal of scraps, where gulls and terns scavenge for tasty tid-bits. Several long shoremen await the lowering of the gangplank of another vessel with empty carts and drays. The stiff breeze off the river invigorates the hustle of the wharf.

The chipped bark path widens to encompass a broad square between the peaked roofs of the village homes, the larger storefronts, and several communal buildings that all surround a magnificent fountain crafted from local sandstone. The multi-tiered fountain flows with pure, clean springwater and provides seating around its broad base.  The towering trees surround the village, enclosing the square in a living frame.  To the west is a sturdy building with its door perpetually ajar. A line of Leuian children trots off towards the north, bearing their lessons. The faint ding of nautical bells flows in on the breeze from the northwest.   A flowing gold-flecked sandstone fountain and a dirty oak-handled spade are here.

The village homes snuggle closer together as the path nears the town center, and eventually widens to include a few communal buildings and a burbling fountain to the west.  The village bustles with life at all hours. Towering trees spread their branches over the buildings, as if embracing them.    A stack of rocks and an overgrown back alley are here.

[Commodore Island Park.]

A soothing peace has settled over the forest here at the center of the park, where the mists coalesce and then dance back out again amongst the trees. Many small rivulets of water feed into an indent atop a large collection of boulders. As the water overflows the pool, it spills across the sides of the stone to trickle down the steps of the rock formation. Smaller pools are formed as it cascades over the rock until at last the rivulets are reunited into a single small stream which finds its way home to the larger river. Delicate flowering moss has grown over the stones of this centerpiece of the forest, and a small family of larks takes delight in bathing beneath the tiny waterfalls and mossy pools, even as the melodic chirping of other birds wafts through the tree branches all around.  A stack of rocks and a closed door are here.

Far above the forest floor, the looming trees' canopy shades the park's paths. Every few feet a break in the leaves lights a fortunate fern or clover patch that languishes in the gift from the heavens. A giant among oaks, dwarfed by the mighty conifers enjoys such a boon.  Its twisted branches decry the battle to survive beneath the taller competitors. Nestled in the crotches of the oak branches, beautiful orchids thrive and bloom despite the weather, causing many of the villagers to believe that the goddess herself has adopted the oak as one of her protected monuments. The villagers have placed benches made of koy around the oak that complement the park without detracting from its natural beauty.  An ancient gnarled oak tree, some fragrant amber orchids, a beautiful hand-carved koy wood bench, a stack of rocks, and an ivy covered sandstone arch are here.

Under the canopy of the huge trees, the cooling peace of the forest mists continues to caress the earth amongst the sweeping fern leaves. Two immense redwood trees, grandfathers to their smaller brethren, stand as silent guardians at the entrance to a natural park. The giants are marked by great rents from limbs lost in mighty winds and scars from both fire and mortal carelessness; yet the ancient trees bear these scars like honored badges, a testament to the vast history of this forest. The limbs of the grandfather conifers cross in a beautiful but simple arch over the path between the trees leading into the park.  A pair of tall ancient redwood trees, a closed wrought iron gate, and a stack of rocks are here.

The churning waters of the Darkith continue their journey to the ocean beyond the protection of the rocky breakwater to the east.  A small safe harbor sits unflaggingly in the resulting eddy, bolstered by the sand and silt erosion of the Great Divide far beyond the horizon, to the Northeast.  A tidy village hugs the river's edge taking full advantage of the lush island growth and natural haven.  A smooth stone tunnel and a stack of rocks are here.

[Commodore Island Park.]

A worn rock cliff-face juts out from the island's hillside, its worn edges descending steeply until it finally dives down into the depths of the river.  The river's current boils angrily against the staunch rocks, working to tear their very existence into pebbles and sand.  A smooth tunnel paved with flat stones and supported by solid wooden beams cuts through the cliff.  A smooth dark stone tunnel, a Hithual crafted oak barrel, and a huge pile of dirt are here.

A wide avenue paved with gravel cuts the gentle slope of the island's north side and bears the mark of heavy equipment being transported to the interior of the island.

Sand, debris, rocks, and finally soil deposited by the Darkith river over thousands of years have piled against a natural rock barrier to create an inter-river island.  The course of the mighty Darkith has altered slightly to accomodate the building bulk of the island and now flows on both sides.  Rapids sluice on the east and west side of this island, filling the air with a damp mist that sits heavily on the countryside.  A floating pontoon bridge, some cut green branches, and a large brush pile are here.

[Darkith River Bridge.]

Shuddering and shifting under the weight of all but the smallest travelers, this floating bridge plies the churning dark waters of the Darkith with ponderous grace. Thick hand sawed planks are tied together with huge twisted hemp ropes and cushioned with rubber bumpers to ease the constant ebb of the river's flow.  Each tar-coated plank moves independantly of the others, causing serpentine twists in the bridge's original shape.

A few guards do a roving patrol of the area and down to the bridge. They check the caravans before they enter and anyone that looks suspicious they throw into the river. They seem quite wary of anyone coming or going to and from the city. From their appearance it would seem best to stay on their good sides and hope that they are in good moods.  A closed large sturdy wooden gate, a stone bridge, and some leafy branches and trees are here.

[Meetpoint.]

Here a gate leads out of the fort and into the Southern regions. Several children run and play just inside the gate, under the watchful eyes of the guards. What was once a very well used trade route has slowed to some caravans bringing supplies for the townsmen and the occasional merchants traveling from the far southern reaches of the land. Many guards protect this section of the fort as it is home to some wild beasts that live outside these walls.

Within the heart of this proud fort one can see all around that the reconstruction of its buildings has begun. Large stones and logs have been stacked and piled, while some workers tirelessly attempt to repair the damage that occurred here during the Lords of Chaos wars. The buildings and homes of the people that resided here are slowly taking shape, though, far from completed. The smell of dyes, used to paint the town, permeate the area.  A breathtaking shimmering bouquet of moonflowers, an open light blue door, a glowing wrought iron street lantern, and a fluffy white layer of snow are here.

Two guards patrol above the gate, looking you over carefully before giving leave to pass through the heavy wood gate. Thick and long wooden ladders serve up to the guard's posts high in the sky so that they may have some relief from their duties overlooking the land and city. Through the slates of the wooden walkways, you can make out four archers playing a game of cards, weapons at the ready. A whip cracks loudly as a caravan heads out the gate towards Spur.  An open wooden gate and a fluffy white layer of snow are here.

The tradeways path leads directly to the imposing north-eastern gate of a stately fort. Even from this distance, the sounds of commerce and progress ring loudly as the harnesses of trader wagons jingle along the busy roadway and saws buzz noisily. The tradeway is constantly full of traffic going in both directions.  An open wooden gate is here.

Rising up out of the plains, a large walled fort receives the end of the stone road. The river flows from either side, running through the fort from this angle of view. The vegetation surrounding the tradeway at this point has recently, allowing a clear field of vision from the tops of the walls ahead. The stones show little wear from the heavy traffic.

The grass rises taller and taller in every direction further limiting view just off the roadside. A second glance reveals that this is the lowest point in a large, shallow depression. The tradeway sinks a little lower as it gets closer to the river off to the west. A ditch runs alongside the river's side of the road, small puddles of water filling the bottom. Trickles filter into the puddles from the grass beyond as mosquitoes dart across the muddy surfaces.

[Southern Tradeway.]

Only the well-built, stone tradeway gives any hint of civilization ever having had any presence here. The tall grasses limit visibility nearby, hiding any wildlife that may be waiting for prey to stumble too close. A few blades of grass sway slightly in the breeze, some of them broken by the passing of something heavy over them. One of the larger stones in the road, broken loose from its mortar, waits patiently to be repaired.

The stone paved tradeway stretches across the open plains, interrupting nature's task of consuming the land. An endless sea of grass surrounds you, lapping at the road much like the tides against a beach. The faintly damp wind occasionally blowing in from the west smells of earth. Some of the stones in the road interlock together to form the crude image of a lion. There is no discerning if it was done on purpose or sheer accident.

The tradeway runs across the open grasslands northeast towards the Spur, and southwest towards distant lands and eventually, the coast. The plains to the south and east seem totally indifferent to your existence. Just ahead, a small path moves up a village of huts spread out in a semi-circle. In the center of the village a giant fire pit sits where barbarians who wander through the village can sit around to stay warm.  A worn grassy path is here.

[Wilderness gate.]

Set within a wide tunnel leading through the hedge to the north is the Wilderness Gate. It separates the settled lands of Spur from the open plains to the south of the city. The plains stretch as far as the eyes can see, the horizon and the walls of the fort down the road the only blemishes of the grassy landscape in the distance. The stones of the road are smoothly set together, well built to withstand heavy travel. A broken wagon wheel, discarded some time ago, covers a spot of nearby grass, weeds trying to climb through the spokes.  An open bronze gate is here.

Through the gate lies the city of Spur, the major center of trade and civilization on the plains. The dusty road leading through the gates is well traveled, and walls of the city are in good repair. A small shack sits to the west of the road, during most times of the day a dusty coach can be seen waiting in front, its horses stomping with impatience to be gone. To the right of the door is a small window, its opening covered with metal bars. An old man, missing most of his teeth, waits patiently for the travelers to pay their fare, and then directs them into the waiting area. On the east side of the road a billowing multicolored tent has been erected, the hustle and bustle of merchants and customers can be seen coming and going at all times of the day.  A rainbow silk tent, a closed iron gate, and a fluffy white layer of snow are here.

A well-guarded gateway separates the city's residential district from the farmlands just beyond. Guards carefully eye all that enter or exit the city, beckoning gruffly to random travelers for a closer inspection. The structure of the guards' barracks is visible above the road to the west.

The occasional locked gate marks the entrance to some of the more hidden estates of Spurs nobility. From this broad avenue, little can be seen of their splendor. Behind the imposing gate recedes a proud drive, disappearing mysteriously into the trees. If not for the large imposing tower rising above the hedges it would be hard to discern anything was beyond the gate. It is apparent the residents do not wish to be disturbed.  A street lantern, a closed morbius door, and an open black iron gate are here.

The room you have entered is dark and damp, and quite possibly has not been stepped in for many years. It is square and has three arches which lead north, south and west. One thing you notice is that the room looks remarkably clean.

This room is not illuminated.
In the room are Rutferd the Leuian, Crax the Noble Leuian, and Draejlen the Leuian.
Obvious exits: north south west.

You follow Crax south...

[Hallway.]

This hallway looks as though it has remained untouched for a very long time, and yet you cannot help but notice that it is immaculate. You can hear scampering noises through the stone walls on either side of you.

[Prison check room.]

You have entered a large room which looks to be a crossroads of sorts. There is broken wood scattered on the floor, and three doorways, east, south and west. You wonder why there are no doors in any of the wooden door frames of the doorways.

This room is not illuminated.
In the room are Rutferd the Leuian, Crax the Noble Leuian, and Draejlen the Leuian.

The force of a recent explosion has knocked a path through the once-blocked south hallway, revealing a fourth prison section. You watch your footing carefully.

You are standing between what can best be described as two prison cells, to the east and west. However, you do not see any sign that there was ever a door of any type in front of either cell. You ponder this as you walk carefully in the area.

[Prison cell.]

You have entered a prison cell which does not have any door. There is garbage strewn about the floor and various things written on the wall. The remains of a bench and some pottery are all that is left to remind the observer that someone once was here.  A pair of blue stones and a pair of green stones are here.

The occasional locked gate marks the entrance to some of the more hidden estates of Spurs nobility. From this broad avenue, little can be seen of their splendor. Behind the imposing gate recedes a proud drive, disappearing mysteriously into the trees. If not for the large imposing tower rising above the hedges it would be hard to discern anything was beyond the gate. It is apparent the residents do not wish to be disturbed.

Majestic elms continue to line this broad roadway, sheltering the avenue on both sides and further enhancing the grandiose atmosphere.

A thick, sturdy sign stands just off to the side of a charming path, its large friendly letters intent on luring travelers into the city's premiere roadstay, the Gilded Lion Inn. The entrance is clearly marked and welcoming, extending off to the southeast.  A wooden sign and a street lantern are here.

[Noble Way.]

Numerous trees lining the avenue serve as the dividing border between the majestic estates of the nobility and the lightly traveled roadway. The estates themselves are noticeably closer to the avenue than those to the south. However, they are no easier to access, still protected by their own guarding walls, some covered with ivy or colorful blooming vines.  A street lantern is here.

The entire avenue is composed of fine cobblestone, each level with its neighbor, providing a smooth ride for passing carriages and horses. The stones were customized by craftsmen, cut to order, rather than simply placed wherever they might fit. A few stately oaks and elms line the sides of the road, shading travelers during the daylight hours.  A street lantern is here.

[Intersection.]

The avenue comes to a fork, with Noble Way curving from south to the northwest. A side-street heading off to the east leads to an extremely well kept neighborhood that easily surpasses everything around it in splendor and magnificence. Everything, even the carefully pruned trees and the manicured shrubbery displays a desire for elegant perfection.  A street lantern is here.

Leaving the exceptionally wealthy estates of the Spurian nobility, Noble Way heads toward the Town Square to the northwest. Along the roadside can be seen the in-city homes of successful merchants and other wealthy citizens of the Spur. The homes display a slightly different style, perhaps they are not quite so restrained; a touch more exuberance and freedom with materials is displayed.  A street lantern is here.

Gazing down each of the nearby private drives reveals a glimpse of a luxurious home, each a miniature estate in its own right. Short, stout walls and manicured hedges serve to keep out the riffraff and to protect the small, expensive gardens. Every detail has been attended to display the exotic plants, in all their pampered perfection.  A street lantern and a closed rosewood door are here.

Noble Way continues to wind its way among the rather modestly sized, but elegant, homes of the Spur's successful. Many a peasant farmer may live in homes larger than these, but none can match the quality found here. A peaceful, luxurious feeling pervades this part of town; perhaps it is the drifting floral scents wafting from the well-tended gardens.  A closed elegant black iron gate and a street lantern are here.

Many grand, even ostentatious, homes line this stretch of Noble Way. Most of the residents here were fortunate enough to be born into the right families. Few that live in this area have ever actually had to work for a living. Glancing at the nameplates reveals many of the recognizable names of the Spur. Some of these names could almost be considered famous.  A street lantern is here.

An unusually large home, even for this part of town, lies off to the west. It seems as if one ambitious owner is slowly buying up the lots next to his and adding them to his own. Groundskeepers are at work in the surrounding gardens, trimming and raking, so intent on their work they do not bother to acknowledge the passing traffic on the road.  A street lantern is here.

To the north, you can make out an ornately scrolled gateway set in the base of the imposing city wall. The refined roadway of Noble Way stretches out to the south. The cobblestones of the road are smooth and even. The attention to detail shown here is a dramatic change from some of the other parts of the city.  A street lantern is here.

An elegant, carved wooden sign hangs above the ornate gateway set into the massive wall that divides Spurs Noble District from the Town Square. You can make out city guardsmen peering down attentively at all that approach from their posts atop the imposing wall. They seem to take a greater interest in this part of town, though there does not seem to be anything threatening enough here to warrant such attention.  A street lantern, an open iron gate, and a gilded silver plaque are here.

Standing next to the large iron gate that separates the center of town from those of the elite class are several of the Spurian Guard. They are here to assist all who pass with the simple kindness of opening a gate, or the more important task of escorting those in need to the bank or market. A young looking cadet rubs wax into the stones of the city wall, his task is daunting, but one that will teach him discipline.  An open iron gate and a street lantern are here.

The boughs of a large apple tree hang over the well tended avenue. Below the beautiful tree stands a small fountain. Atop the fountain is an intricately carved Secian who appears to be dancing with the water as it splashes around her. Set in the marble base is a small plaque that reads, "For those who have gone before us." Many stand for a moment as they pass this way, giving thanks for the gift of life that is given by both the apple tree and the Secians of long ago. Large piles of dirt and broken stone lay on either side of the street as workmen ready the east and west alleys for expansion.  A street lantern, an open Secian etched moonsilver door, a pair of open silver forged swinging doors, and a sign above the doors are here.

Vast estates tower over the huge Spurian wall towards the south. The well-to-do who live in these homes idle away their days, enjoying the luxury of time. Standing next to a very empty lantern pole, a small Flerian child insists in a plaintive wail, that he had nothing to do with the missing lantern. The well-dressed guard that interrogates him keeps pointing at a small sack on the ground and its obvious contents.  An open small burlap sack, a street lantern, and a lantern are here.

The outward appearance of the people here seems a bit classier. Rich clothing and large coin purses are prevalent amongst the travelers. In fact, many of the folk heading into Town Square from the south are accompanied by large bodyguards to assure their safety. The well maintained road is lined with small brass lanterns, each swinging off an individual pole.  A street lantern and a fluffy white layer of snow are here.

[Town Square Center.]

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.  A flowing white marble fountain, a marble statue of a Human, a shimmering marble statue of a Dragon, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a rosewood sign, a crisp gold lettered vellum notice, a fluffy white layer of snow, a glistening white snow fort, a pile of sparkling snow balls, a broken bone studded bearskin hood, and a bent copper staff are here.

This area is illuminated.
You see the 1st red-tailed hawk (wearing a small gold collar) and the 1st city guard mage.

People carrying bundles stream in from the west and rapidly lose themselves in the large crowds moving about in the vast town square. Several citizens head west with bulging coinpurses babbling excitedly about what they're going to purchase. Giggling children dart around the slower moving folks rushing on their way to spend the silvers in their pockets.  A street lantern and a fluffy white layer of snow are here.

Several city guardsmen have just finished wrestling to the ground some young tough thieves, who thought to rob one of the returning merchants.

An inviting eatery stands beside the road, its door open to those weary after a long trip to Spur, as well as those preparing to venture to the great expanses beyond the west gate. A human couple exit the building, arm in arm. A small sign stands beside the intersection.  A sign, an open glossy lacquered oak door, and a street lantern are here.

An arch between two large buildings connects Market Circle and Market Street. The more reputable shopkeepers do business within the circle, but pay higher taxes for the privilege.
