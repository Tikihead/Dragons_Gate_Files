[Ari'kian Keep Grounds.]

Stepping stones cut across what was once a large lawn. Their destination is the rather imposing manse to the north. Weeds have choked out any grass that may have at one time existed. A cold breeze drifts across the area, even the most stoic can feel the goose bumps rising on their arms.  An open old black obsidian gate is here.

Grey stepping stones, worn with time, bisect the overgrowth of weeds. They give you access to the untended flower beds that front the mansion. Waist high weeds crowd out what visible path remains. Your best bet seems to be to aim for the front door or the gate to the south.

Worn boards of the porch creek against your weight. Two massive obsidian front doors stand before you. A tarnished brass knocker, in the shape of a demon head, glares down. The porch extends across the front of the Keep, and at one time must have been a nice place to watch both the sunrise and sunset.  Some open massive black obsidian double doors and some black marble stairs are here.

Entering the foyer the first thing you notice is its subtle opulence. The floor is highly polished black marble, the walls are covered with a gold stripped, cream colored paper. Light filters in through a large paned glass window which, at one time must have glistened, but is now coated with the accumulation of years of dirt. A finely crafted staircase, its balustrade polished from many years of use, rises to the second floor unsupported.  A polished oak circular staircase and some open massive black obsidian double doors are here.

This long dark hall stretches the length of the keep. Highly polished wooden floors are covered with a long black hallway runner. Gold papered walls are punctuated with creamy white flecks. Small crystal sconces dot the walls at various intervals, their candles melted down to useless stubs.  A polished oak staircase and a polished oak circular staircase are here.

The small landing of the third floor is elegantly decorated. Even time and dust have not ravished the understated opulence. A large crystal chandelier hangs from the ceiling, its teardrop crystals tinkling from the breeze entrance. A black velvet settee reclines against the wall below beautiful lead-paned windows framed with gold and black velvet drapes.  A polished oak staircase is here.

Heading off the main hallway is a smaller, less elaborate, branch. The marble flooring continues both directions, but it is plain to see that while no expense was spared in the main hallway, the small western hallway is stark in comparison. Two gold brocade chairs rest against the eastern wall, a small oak table sits between them. Bumping up against either chair will get you a mouthful of choking dust.

Two doors stand face to face on both the northern and southern walls. They are made of a simple pine, and not finished.  An open pine door and a broken pine door are here.

A rather large and ornate bed dominates this room. Its beautiful red velvet coverlet and plush feather ticking seem very out of place in this austere servant's quarters. The only other furniture in this room is a small pine table with a cracked bowl and dusty pitcher upon it. An old faded tapestry covered with nymphs frolicking in a flowered pasture hangs on the wall.  An open simple pine door is here.

A green veined marble chair occupies the center position in this portion of the tower. The armrests contain thick leather straps, obviously designed for holding the occupant of the chair in place securely, and sharp spikes where the wrists would rest. Similar restraints are found where the legs would be, and a larger leather binding hangs where a head would be positioned. Directly under the armrests hang rusted copper buckets.  A cold spiraling stone staircase is here.

A green veined marble chair occupies the center position in this portion of the tower. The armrests contain thick leather straps, obviously designed for holding the occupant of the chair in place securely, and sharp spikes where the wrists would rest. Similar restraints are found where the legs would be, and a larger leather binding hangs where a head would be positioned. Directly under the armrests hang rusted copper buckets.  A cold spiraling stone staircase is here.

A green veined marble chair occupies the center position in this portion of the tower. The armrests contain thick leather straps, obviously designed for holding the occupant of the chair in place securely, and sharp spikes where the wrists would rest. Similar restraints are found where the legs would be, and a larger leather binding hangs where a head would be positioned. Directly under the armrests hang rusted copper buckets.  A cold spiraling stone staircase, a short iron frying pan, some crooked glass spectacles, and a worn ragdoll are here.

In the area are Minnie the Secian, Cinnamon the Noble Secian (holding a glowing violet crystal heart), Castin the Anthian, and Slep'infir'a the Dragon.

A rusted mess of iron chains lay sprawled across the floor. The cold, black iron that once held helpless prisoners taut in place has given way to brittle, burnt orange links. A large rodent skitters across he warped floor, its yellow eyes never leaving yours.

Concentric circles of fire-blackened stone form an eerie pattern on the floor beneath a suspended platform. The platform, hanging haphazardly by pulleys from only two of its four corners, is crafted from loose sheets of ring mail. Each ring is large enough to allow your finger to pass through, as well as the searing heat of the fire. The ring mail still holds strands of hair and rotting scales.  A cold stone staircase is here.

Small knobs adorn the wall on either side of the circular staircase. Upon further inspection, these knobs are actually small ebony hands, palms up and fingers slightly curved into a grasping position.

The charred remains of a cherry wood cabinet stand in the dim light. Multicolored shards of glass line the doors and litter the base of the wooden display case. Undisturbed within are many different instruments of pain and torture: long pins, barbed needles, jagged slivers of bluesteel, studded flails, spiked collars, and coils of finely-linked moonsilver.

The thin yet distinct carving of a female Anthian standing sideways, her wings flared, forms the carved doors of a cabinet leaning against the cold stone wall. Opening the cherry construct requires for the bird-creature's wings to be pulled away from its body. This would explain the agony carved into her face.  A wooden broom, a sharp sewing needle, some stale bread, a rope noose, a shiny trinket, a small dull piece of pyrite, and a simple gold necklace are here.

Concentric circles of fire-blackened stone form an eerie pattern on the floor beneath a suspended platform. The platform, hanging haphazardly by pulleys from only two of its four corners, is crafted from loose sheets of ring mail. Each ring is large enough to allow your finger to pass through, as well as the searing heat of the fire. The ring mail still holds strands of hair and rotting scales.  A cold stone staircase is here.

Stepping inside one of the cramped cells offers a perspective few wish to retain. Black iron manacles, hanging from chains imbedded in the walls, clank against each other hauntingly. The heavy, metallic smell of blood permeates the cell. Any view that might had been offered by the window has been squelched by the boards nailed over it.   A button eyed sock puppet, an empty small silver shot glass, some broken iron manacles, some broken iron manacles, a wooden broom, a bloody bone tooth, a small silver shot glass, and an open enchanting buckskin pouch are here.

A rusted mess of iron chains lay sprawled across the floor. The cold, black iron that once held helpless prisoners taut in place has given way to brittle, burnt orange links. A large rodent skitters across he warped floor, its yellow eyes never leaving yours.  A bronze saber, a mysterious bone runestone, some blood-stained grey leather breeches, a small amulet, a wooden lockpick, a pair of scuffed sandals, a short steel butcher knife, a cotton tunic, a tacky cloth barmaid dress, a short iron frying pan, a two-handed steel scythe, a jagged quartz rock, a bottle of fragrant cognac, and a small onyx bead are here.

The thin yet distinct carving of a female Anthian standing sideways, her wings flared, forms the carved doors of a cabinet leaning against the cold stone wall.

Heading off the main hallway is a smaller, less elaborate, branch.

Two gold brocade chairs rest against the eastern wall, a small oak table sits between them. Bumping up against either chair will get you a mouthful of choking dust.

While the tunnel is still well made and structurally sound, the air deep within is dank and moist. On closer inspection, hair-line fractures have appeared in the smoothly cut tunnel walls, allowing a few moist rivuletes to seep through onto the granite's surface. The walls are streaked dark from the constant flow of the cold, clear water.

The dark granite walls of the tunnel are so well engineered that no cracks have appeared, even after years of pressure from the mountain. The lack of telltale dust or sand fouling the perfect floor does little to take one's mind off the looming presence of millions of tons of rock above.

Huge boulders have created a bowl shaped depression in this sheltered hillock. A stand of scruffy trees continues to eke out a tenuous existence above the rocky outpost; their long tortured roots clinging desperately to what little soil is caught between the boulders.

Many of the smaller carts follow the buyers and merchants to avoid the conflicts with the larger wagons that continue west. The shouting up ahead quickens the pulse of even the most experienced seller.  A street lantern is here.

The bottleneck of carts, merchants and buyers block any exit out of the Bazaar to the north. While it is easy to travel with traffic, trying to move against it is impossible. Those who drive the large wagons that navigate these small streets shout curses and vile threats at each other, hoping it creates a break in traffic and allows them to move forward to their destination.

Other than the odd customer passing en route to another shop, nobody pauses before this empty stall. Stalls such as these are rented out to the locals for their personal use. Bits of refuse from food sold to the south litter the ground.  This stall is becoming someone's personal trash dump.

[Food Way.]

At this intersection many stands display their exotic foodstuffs. Hanging from large hooks are various unidentifiable hunks of meat, and vegetables of all shapes and colors. The only thing more prevalent than the merchants and buyers are the bugs, who clamor to find the most pungent item to land on. To the northeast a small tent can barely be seen hiding behind the stalls.  A white silk tent and a street lantern are here.

Moving into the heart of the Bazaar, you encounter a more established shop. The building is sturdier, and built for long term occupancy. The general store has a steady stream of customers, and it serves those young adventurers who are in need of supplies.  A weathered wooden sign, an open faded chestnut door, and a street lantern are here.

Guards stand before each stall at this intersection, on what has come to be known as Jeweler's Row. Crowds of customers vie for the finest stones and most beautiful gems. All different manner of merchants hawk their wares as those you should buy. Those who are not careful are just as liable to walk away with a sparkly piece of glass as an expensive diamond.  A bright vellum sign, an open stall, and a street lantern are here.

Standing on the western side of the road is a small stall filled with beakers and assorted philters. Exotic potions of both the mundane and magical variety are being offered for sale. Standing on either side of the stall door are two rather large Thugian guards, the merchant takes no chances with his special concoctions.  A sign, an open stall, and a street lantern are here.

The well-defined Bazaar path heads off to the west. This corner is a mix of the old and the new. On one corner an old stall is barely standing. The roof has caved in, and it quickly becomes apparent that this location has become a local dump. Pieces of wood that look suspiciously like some of the leftovers from other construction sites are piled on top of rotting offal. On the opposite corner a new tent is being erected, its high roof and vivid coloring pleasing to the eye.  An open stall and a street lantern are here.

A long wooden stall is set here between the Bazaar path and the large barracks which house the Spurian guard. Hanging from the front of the rickety wooden roof are furs of every type. The merchant inside is rumored to give good prices for pelts, hides, and animal parts.  A tanned leather sign, an open sturdy fur-lined stall, and a street lantern are here.

A new stall has been hastily constructed on this site, in the shadow of the large Spurian Wall. Most chose to build well within the Bazaar as opposed to this outer path. Low-grade wood and bent nails make up this sorry excuse for a business establishment. A small sign on the front has a crude picture of a key on it, and the name, "Skugz."  A crooked wooden sign, a weathered dark wooden stall, and a broken street lantern are here.

Two large Oog-ra guards refuse to allow anyone to continue south. With loud gestures and over exaggerated pointing, they send wagons to the east or back north. With some slapping of backs, and happy grins, they congratulate themselves on following directions. A yell is heard from the south as Skugz screams, "Keep meee dooor clear...yes yeees...keep it clear." It is a wonder that he hasn't figured out they are turning away his customers.

A slinky dressed female San Elf preens and giggles garnering the attention of several humans leaning out the window of the guards' quarters. Catcalls and whistles abound as she shows more thigh then is warranted. A wagon driver, distracted by the view, almost drives into a cart coming the opposite direction. Shouts are exchanged and fists shaken, as the San female snickers at all those involved.  A street lantern is here.

Bazaar Path follows the line of the Spurian Wall. High above you can hear orders being barked and guards marching in rhythm. The closeness of the wall to the path has essentially blocked any breeze that might waft through the area. The stagnant air holds in the smells of food, incense and lots of bodies. It is not unusual to see the cart drivers with triangles of cloth pulled up over their nose and mouths.  A street lantern is here.

Several large carts head west, full of various items the owners are sure will sell for a decent profit. Empty carts, the sign of a prosperous day, head east. An old Thugian pulls and pushes a very stubborn donkey. Neither end seems to be cooperating with his demands. Two small children dance around the Thugian and the donkey, chanting and singing a nasty song. Quickly, he takes out a switch, which is enough encouragement for both the donkey to move and the children to run.  A street lantern is here.

Many people crowd the narrow Bazaar Path, either heading towards the infamous Bazaar, or forcing their way back towards Trade Way. For a small price, a farmer can rent a booth and directly market his goods. Both some of the best and some of the worst deals can be made within this collection of stalls. The tall wall of Spur looms high to the east, and many of the guards take an early peek into the carts and the goods coming to market.  A street lantern is here.

[Market Circle.]

An arch between two large buildings connects Market Circle and Market Street. The more reputable shopkeepers do business within the circle, but pay higher taxes for the privilege. The buildings have been built to last, as these merchants are no traveling tinkers. Interlocking stone walkways and colorful plantings span this central area. Despite the number of animals waiting outside the bank for their owners, the area is spotless. Loud chatter in many languages can be heard from the southwest.  A marble archway, an open elegant gold-trimmed walnut door, and a wooden sign are here.

The buildings of Market Circle stand to the south. It becomes obvious that the area through the arch is a much cleaner marketplace than the bazaar. An inviting eatery stands beside the road, its door open to those weary after a long trip to Spur, as well as those preparing to venture to the great expanses beyond the west gate. A human couple exit the building, arm in arm. A small sign stands beside the intersection.  A sign, an open glossy lacquered oak door, and a street lantern are here.

This well-worn road separates the Bazaar to the north and Market Circle to the south. Only a Thugian could appreciate the layered odors of simmering foodstuffs and shoppers from the Bazaar.

Many townsfolk pass along this busy thoroughfare. Rich and poor alike mix freely on this street, much to the dismay of a passing nobleman.

A large gate separates the Merchant District and Town Square-the hub of Spur's activity. The partially opened gate is currently able to accommodate the simultaneous passage of several locals and visitors, but can be expanded to accept carriages, or sealed to ward against invasion.

Merchant Walk comes to an abrupt end at a massive moonsilver gate.

Several city guardsmen have just finished wrestling to the ground some young tough thieves, who thought to rob one of the returning merchants.

Merchants, some in frilly finery, others dressed in homespun wools, travel back and forth along this street on their way to and from work. They seem to blend together here, if only briefly.

People carrying bundles stream in from the west and rapidly lose themselves in the large crowds moving about in the vast town square.

The outward appearance of the people here seems a bit classier. Rich clothing and large coin purses are prevalent amongst the travelers. In fact, many of the folk heading into Town Square from the south are accompanied by large bodyguards to assure their safety. The well maintained road is lined with small brass lanterns, each swinging off an individual pole. No expense has been spared to keep those who travel this road safe from the hoodlums that relish the darkness.  A street lantern is here.

Vast estates tower over the huge Spurian wall towards the south. The well-to-do who live in these homes idle away their days, enjoying the luxury of time. Standing next to a very empty lantern pole, a small Flerian child insists in a plaintive wail, that he had nothing to do with the missing lantern. The well-dressed guard that interrogates him keeps pointing at a small sack on the ground and its obvious contents.  An open small burlap sack and a street lantern are here.

The boughs of a large apple tree hang over the well tended avenue. Below the beautiful tree stands a small fountain. Atop the fountain is an intricately carved Secian who appears to be dancing with the water as it splashes around her. Set in the marble base is a small plaque that reads, "For those who have gone before us." Many stand for a moment as they pass this way, giving thanks for the gift of life that is given by both the apple tree and the Secians of long ago. Large piles of dirt and broken stone lay on either side of the street as workmen ready the east and west alleys for expansion.  A street lantern is here.

Standing next to the large iron gate that separates the center of town from those of the elite class are several of the Spurian Guard. They are here to assist all who pass with the simple kindness of opening a gate, or the more important task of escorting those in need to the bank or market. A young looking cadet rubs wax into the stones of the city wall, his task is daunting, but one that will teach him discipline.  An open iron gate and a street lantern are here.

An elegant, carved wooden sign hangs above the ornate gateway set into the massive wall that divides Spurs Noble District from the Town Square. You can make out city guardsmen peering down attentively at all that approach from their posts atop the imposing wall. They seem to take a greater interest in this part of town, though there does not seem to be anything threatening enough here to warrant such attention.

An unusually large home, even for this part of town, lies off to the west. It seems as if one ambitious owner is slowly buying up the lots next to his and adding them to his own. Groundskeepers are at work in the surrounding gardens, trimming and raking, so intent on their work they do not bother to acknowledge the passing traffic on the road.  A street lantern is here.

Many a peasant farmer may live in homes larger than these, but none can match the quality found here. A peaceful, luxurious feeling pervades this part of town; perhaps it is the drifting floral scents wafting from the well-tended gardens.  An elegant black iron gate and a street lantern are here.

Leaving the exceptionally wealthy estates of the Spurian nobility, Noble Way heads toward the Town Square to the northwest. Along the roadside can be seen the in-city homes of successful merchants and other wealthy citizens of the Spur. The homes display a slightly different style, perhaps they are not quite so restrained; a touch more exuberance and freedom with materials is displayed.  A street lantern is here.

[Noble Way.]

The entire avenue is composed of fine cobblestone, each level with its neighbor, providing a smooth ride for passing carriages and horses. The stones were customized by craftsmen, cut to order, rather than simply placed wherever they might fit. A few stately oaks and elms line the sides of the road, shading travelers during the daylight hours.  A street lantern is here.

[Noble Way.]

Numerous trees lining the avenue serve as the dividing border between the majestic estates of the nobility and the lightly traveled roadway. The estates themselves are noticeably closer to the avenue than those to the south. However, they are no easier to access, still protected by their own guarding walls, some covered with ivy or colorful blooming vines.  A street lantern is here.

Occasional gates and driveways lead back into the well-kept estates of the city's nobility, breaking and adding interest to the defining plane of the walls lining Noble Way. The rest of the street seems to mimic the splendor of the estates beyond the wall. Swept and trimmed, the roadway exudes a simple, yet beautiful elegance.  A street lantern is here.

[Noble Crossroads.]

A small roadway bordered by flowering hedges bisects the wide avenue of Noble Way at a right angle, heading east to west.  A thick, sturdy sign stands just off to the side of a charming path, its large friendly letters intent on luring travelers into the city's premiere roadstay, the Gilded Lion Inn. The entrance is clearly marked and welcoming, extending off to the southeast.  A wooden sign and a street lantern are here.

[Park Road.]

An exotic blend of shrubs and bushes glorify both sides of this short avenue. Starting at only a few feet tall, they slowly gain in height as they line the road to the west, reaching well over man-height at the distant archway that marks the entrance to Spur Park. To the side of the road is an open small gate. It has the look of a private residence.  An open small iron gate and a street lantern are here.

A small path begins under the broad archway leading into the park, and winds peacefully through a beautiful variety of trees, shrubs and flowers. A sweet fragrance fills the area, hinting at the existence of some rare flowering plant nearby. The arch itself is covered with ivy and moss and shows signs of gradual decay from long exposure to the weather.  A street lantern is here.

[Spur Park.]

You gaze out over a rolling expanse of lushly groomed grass. City gardeners work diligently in the distance, pruning and raking the various beds and plantings. The surroundings are peaceful as only a slight breeze stirs the branches above. The faint scratching sound of the rakes is barely audible. An archway leads back out of the park.

[Spur Park.]

A curved wooden bridge has been built over this inlet of the ornamental pond. The bridge provides access to the rest of the park as well as a good vantage to enjoy the view. A quick glance down into the water reveals the flash of a shimmering, rainbow-hued fish darting nervously out of sight.  A flowing Go-blin-al cherub statue is here.

Standing proudly in the center of this clearing is a statue of the current Governor. The existing statue is replaced by that of the new as each governor takes office. This one has not yet suffered the debilitating effects of wind and weather. Meticulously groomed grass surrounds the monument as well as a few recent plantings that have yet to take hold.

[Underground Spring]

The rough stone ceiling dips closer and the entire cave seems to narrow in all directions. Stark formations of rock jut from both ceiling and floor, making travel between them difficult at best. Between the obstacles runs a phosphorescent stream of water originating at a weeping fissure in the far wall. The dampness settles on your skin and in your lungs.  A crevice is here.

A strangely curved room, the ceiling slopes downward to meet the floor making it difficult to stand upright. Beautiful crystals cluster on every surface and hang from the low rock ceiling.

A shimmering dark crystal formation is here.

You have stumbled on a secret grotto. Several small, colorful birds splash in a dark, clear pool beneath a large rock overhang. The sound of running water can be heard from an unseen source.

Leaving the exceptionally wealthy estates of the Spurian nobility, Noble Way heads toward the Town Square to the northwest.

The homes display a slightly different style, perhaps they are not quite so restrained; a touch more exuberance and freedom with materials is displayed.  A street lantern is here.

Atop the fountain is an intricately carved Secian who appears to be dancing with the water as it splashes around her. Set in the marble base is a small plaque that reads, "For those who have gone before us." Many stand for a moment as they pass this way, giving thanks for the gift of life that is given by both the apple tree and the Secians of long ago. Large piles of dirt and broken stone lay on either side of the street as workmen ready the east and west alleys for expansion.  A street lantern is here.

Beneath the colossal structure rests a large flowing marble fountain. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a shimmering blue pool. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each one a celebrated hero of Spur's past.  A carved marble statue of a Human, a carved marble statue of a Dragon, a brightly painted wooden birdhouse, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, and a flowing white marble fountain are here.

In fact, many of the folk heading into Town Square from the south are accompanied by large bodyguards to assure their safety.

[Town Square East.]

Travel to the eastern portion of Town Square finds battle clad warriors shoulder to shoulder with chained criminals and those who live outside the Spurian Walls. The cobblestones that line the street are stained with blood.  It is unknown as to whether the blood is from guards carrying out quick executions, or gladiators who refused to wait their turn for arena space.  A street lantern is here.

[Town Square Center.]

A massive gate dominates the center of Town Square. Monolithic stone imperial dragons stand to each side of the gate like sentinels keeping watch over the city of Spur. Beneath the colossal structure rests a large flowing marble fountain. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a shimmering blue pool. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each one a celebrated hero of Spur's past.  A carved marble statue of a Human, a carved marble statue of a Dragon, a brightly painted wooden birdhouse, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, and a flowing white marble fountain are here.

Vast estates tower over the huge Spurian wall towards the south. The well-to-do who live in these homes idle away their days, enjoying the luxury of time. Standing next to a very empty lantern pole, a small Flerian child insists in a plaintive wail, that he had nothing to do with the missing lantern. The well-dressed guard that interrogates him keeps pointing at a small sack on the ground and its obvious contents.  An open small burlap sack and a street lantern are here.

Set in the marble base is a small plaque that reads, "For those who have gone before us." Many stand for a moment as they pass this way, giving thanks for the gift of life that is given by both the apple tree and the Secians of long ago. Large piles of dirt and broken stone lay on either side of the street as workmen ready the east and west alleys for expansion.  A street lantern is here.

An unusually large home, even for this part of town, lies off to the west. It seems as if one ambitious owner is slowly buying up the lots next to his and adding them to his own.

A small roadway bordered by flowering hedges bisects the wide avenue of Noble Way at a right angle, heading east to west.  A thick, sturdy sign stands just off to the side of a charming path, its large friendly letters intent on luring travelers into the city's premiere roadstay, the Gilded Lion Inn. The entrance is clearly marked and welcoming, extending off to the southeast.  A wooden sign and a street lantern are here.

Majestic elms continue to line this broad roadway, sheltering the avenue on both sides and further enhancing the grandiose atmosphere. Fronting the beautiful homes, cobbled paths edged with narrow flower beds meander through nearby private gardens. Though they appear wonderful places to spend an afternoon or take a picnic, the glances from those tending the estates makes it clear they are only for the invited.  A street lantern is here.

The occasional locked gate marks the entrance to some of the more hidden estates of Spurs nobility. From this broad avenue, little can be seen of their splendor. Behind the imposing gate recedes a proud drive, disappearing mysteriously into the trees. If not for the large imposing tower rising above the hedges it would be hard to discern anything was beyond the gate. It is apparent the residents do not wish to be disturbed.  A street lantern, a closed morbius door, and an open black iron gate are here.

A well-guarded gateway separates the city's residential district from the farmlands just beyond. Guards carefully eye all that enter or exit the city, beckoning gruffly to random travelers for a closer inspection. The structure of the guards' barracks is visible above the road to the west. A weathered wooden sign is posted by the gate.  An open stone gate, a wooden sign, a closed thick stone door, and a street lantern are here.

Through the gate lies the city of Spur, the major center of trade and civilization on the plains. The dusty road leading through the gates is well traveled, and walls of the city are in good repair. A small shack sits to the west of the road, during most times of the day a dusty coach can be seen waiting in front, its horses stomping with impatience to be gone. To the right of the door is a small window, its opening covered with metal bars. An old man, missing most of his teeth, waits patiently for the travelers to pay their fare, and then directs them into the waiting area. On the east side of the road a billowing multicolored tent has been erected, the hustle and bustle of merchants and customers can be seen coming and going at all times of the day.  A rainbow silk tent and an open iron gate are here.

A hedge of spiky brambles forms a natural division from the lands and the swampy terrain to the south. Tall, limbless trees dot the horizon there, their bases lost in the misty depths of the gases hovering over the waters. Now and then a strange, growling sound echos up to the north, or an odd, high-pitched call of some unseen crow, probably feasting on a fallen creature hidden in the mists. The path curves away from the sounds, as popular choice has preferred to travel around the edges, rather than through the marshy sludge.

The open plains are becoming scattered with scraggly trees, the wood of which proving inefficient to use for building as the elements of nature have grown the trunks so twisted and hard in order to withstand the onslaughts of time. Circling around the northern base of a small hill, there lies the lapping edge of the swamp to the south. Small slimy creatures lie on the smooth stones near the water, darting into it at the speed of light as you near them with tiny splashes and echoing wakes blending into the small, gentle waves coming into the shore. Swarms of mosquitoes move along the land in unison, lending them the appearance of large, unified bodies hovering around for the next feast.

A sudden shift in the wind brings forth the sullied aroma of death and decay from the swamp southern lands. Slurpish noises belie the path of some creature traveling through the muddy scape, their movements hidden behind the smoky mist that reduces visibility to a mere few feet past the swamp's edge.

Ravens dark as pitch spread their feathers to a wing-span of nearly four feet, so large they are, as they quarrel over an abandoned mule carcass on the roadside breaks out. How final death seems, so casually nature simply encompasses the bodies of the fallen, through carrion hunters or moldy decay. Yet through death there be life again, any number of these ravens being sustained through this death, so they may live. Perhaps only to become sustenance for one of the swamp creatures, who, in turn, spends its life continuing the cycle.

A small orb of light hovers in the center of the path before you, only to disappear as you near it, reappearing further away into the swamp.

It soon becomes apparent that the mysterious lights are attempting to slyly lead you into the swamp. To or for what purpose, is the question.

Winding through the trees, the path emerges from the dense foliage and continues northward. You begin to wonder if there is a way into the seemingly impenetrable western forest. A track, that looks to be one used by small animals, veers off to the side.

The footbridge that once connected this path to its match on the other side of the overflowing rushing river is now nothing more then a few charred pilings. Tiny insects buzz around their remains, finding a comfortable new home. Lashed to the remains of one of the more sturdy pilings is a tall steel pole. Wrapped around the pole, and tied securely is a taut rope. Bobbing ever so lightly due to the strain of the riverboat, the rope holds tight.  A flowing river, a freshly painted sign, and some carved oak benches are here.

Through the years this giant old oak has been home to many of the forest's creatures, each new inhabitant enlarging the living space bit by bit until it has become what it is today; a hollowed tree large enough to fit a drake, wings and all. Various remnants can be found among the bark chips scattered along the floor, a long bone emerging here, a scrap of thick blanket there.  A gnarled oak opening is here.

Across the water stands an imposing elm tree which shades the far portion of the water. Overhead, the overflow water of the river gushes over a rocky embankment, crashing into the pond and creating a fine mist throughout the area. A charming sitting shelf has been ornately carved into the eastern portion of the pond and stunning roses crawl up the towering stone embankments to the east and west. Blue, pink and red rose petals scatter in the breeze, coming to rest on the ponds surface and an occasional trout can be seen darting back and forth.  A charming waterfall, a deep blue pond, a grey stone sitting shelf, and a narrow gap are here.

The small shack is set back from the road, its walls built of a whitewashed birch. A sturdy corral, filled with well-fed horses, stands to the left of the shack. A matched pair of dapple grays stand in front of the shack waiting to take their human baggage to their destination. To the left of the door, behind a small paned window, a beautiful Fir Elf female takes coin and in return, with a charming smile, directs those who have paid their fare into the waiting room.  A small shack, a freshly painted sign, a notice of non-refund, and a small winding stone pathway are here.

Contrasting starkly with the ashes of the forest and brush is a freshly constructed set of stairs that wraps itself about the large tree. The intricate woodwork that decorates the steps is of the finest quality, as if in parody to the blackened destruction of the hedges and brambles around the base of the trunk. Bright green leaves of clover have begun springing up through the ashy soil in conjunction with soft moss to lend a durable cushion to this well-traveled spot.  Some steps circling the tree, a freshly painted wooden sign, a healthy green patch of clover, a flowing marble fountain, and some clover shaped stones are here.

Strangers arriving at the top of the steps find themselves under the watchful eye of patrons seated at tables positioned about the light, airy room. A set of oak steps lead up to the new Council chambers.  An ivory inlaid pine bar, a wooden stool, a long weathered wooden bench, a long musty wooden table, some steps circling the tree, some freshly crafted oak steps, an open door, a paper covered posting board, a gilt framed painting on the wall, an open large straw basket, and a closed forest green Elindalian book of prayers are here.

Zaheela says, "but, It doesn't matter. My story is simplily titled 'The contest'"

Shleegulz asks Zaheela, "jhoo tell dha bhat storee lass time?"

Zaheela says, "Once upon a time, on a web not too far way, lived two spiders. One was named Ink, the other was a named Stride. While Ink was a cunning, seductive spider, Stride was more the complaining type."

Zaheela says, "Never the less, Elindale only knows why, the two of them were very close, if not the best of friends."

Zaheela says, "One day the two friends were thinking of a way to catch some poor bug for dinner. Inks quick mind was working as fast as a spiders can, and Stride... well, he was complaining his little lungs out from his tunnel."

The vulture spreads its wings.

Shleegulz gasps while cover his mouth not meaning to interrupt, and glances around apologetically.

Zaheela exclaims, ""I am so hungry! Why cant we just make a trap?" He ranted before his thoughts began to trail,  "Man I hate being a spider! Avoiding being smashed, eaten, crushed, drowned, and suffocated to death? I hate it, I hate it, I HATE IT!" he wailed, stomping 3"

The raven eyes you warily.

Zaheela says, "...he wailed, stomping 3 of his feet."

Zaheela coughs.
You see Zaheela take a drink from her ice cold limeade.

The raven spreads its wings.

Zaheela says, "Watching Strides show, Ink spotted a large crowd of flies hovering around a pile of rotten fruit. It was well known that flies werent the smartest bug off the leaf, and they were delectable."

The vulture spreads its wings.

Zaheela asks, "Since there were so many, why not make a game of it?"

Shaleu grins.

Zaheela says, ""Hey Stride." Ink called out to her (still complaining) friend. Turning, he blinked 5 of his 8 eyes, and clicked his manibles. Ink merely smiled and said, "I have a little challenge for you.""

Julien's stomach growls.

Zaheela asks, ""huh?" Stride stared at Ink, who merely smiled and repeated, "A game as well as our way to get dinner. I bet you that I can catch more flies then you could." Ink said, pointing at the nearby fly swarm nearby."

Zaheela exclaims, " "Your on!" replied Stride, drooling at the sight of so many flies."

Zaheela says, "A minute later, Stride set off towards the rear of the swarm of flies. Finding a convenient place to hide, he sat and waited till a group of young flies had approached."

The raven glares.

The raven cleans itself with its beak.

Zaheela exclaims, ""Psst!" he whispered. The flies swiveled their heads, one little fly cleaning his antennae, only to be thawped by his elders. "Over here!" The flies, wary yet stupid, inched over to the hiding Stride."

Zaheela says, "After getting a rather large bunch, he whiped away his drool and began to rant about life and how it basically it stunk to be a insect.."

The raven spreads its wings.

Zaheela asks, ""Do you enjoy being the lowest being on this earth? Do you like the fact that you eat trash,the waste of those humans? Being hated, swatted at. So do you like it? Do you?""

Zaheela says, "He kept on ranting for a hour or so, driving off many of his listeners with pure boredom."

Zaheela says, "Only 3 rather stupid flies remained to follow him to his tunnel where Ink shut the door. After feasting, it was Inks turn. Taking a new hiding place, she laid in wait till another group of flies flew by."

The raven screeches loudly.

Zaheela says, ""Hey, you..." She began, catching the attention of the first fly. He buzzed in confusion and then landed, the others following his example."

Zaheela says, " Grinning wildly, she began to say in a soothing voice "I can take you away from this boring old place. A place where there are mountains of sugar, no giants, and a peaceful life.""

Zaheela says, "She began to tempt the flies with sweet things and all the things that the primitive fly mind would want. Soon after, 7 minutes to be exact, she walked away, a line of 30 or more flies buzzing after her."

Zaheela says, "Stride, who was  by now complaining about Ink making him make such a big hole, turned. His fangs dropped as the flies were forced in, followed by a smirking Ink. Quickly shutting off the entrance, Stride turned to Ink, who was savoring a fat juicy fly."

Zaheela asks, "How in all of the 7 flyswatter hells did you get so many?" He demanded. "Tell me your secret! Tell me! TELL ME TELL ME TELL ME!""

Shleegulz blinks.

Zaheela says, ""Its easy my dear arachnid friend." Ink said, licking her fangs. " as a human man once said, "Tart words get no friends; A spoon full of honey attracts more flies then a gallon of vinegar.""

Four sturdy walls and a roof of woven branches enclose this small tavern. From the forest floor, winding their way around the trunk of the Mother Tree, a set of intricately railed steps serve as the entrance and exit of the town of Treehaven. Strangers arriving at the top of the steps find themselves under the watchful eye of patrons seated at tables positioned about the light, airy room. A set of oak steps lead up to the new Council chambers.  An ivory inlaid pine bar, a wooden stool, a long weathered wooden bench, a long musty wooden table, some steps circling the tree, some freshly crafted oak steps, an open door, a paper covered posting board, a gilt framed painting on the wall, an open large straw basket, a closed forest green Elindalian book of prayers, a quiver of birch arrows, a bowl of billy goat gruff gruel, a bowl of billy goat gruff gruel, a bowl of billy goat gruff gruel, a brown potato, and an empty warm mug of Muldavian coffee are here.

This room is illuminated.
You see the 1st vulture (wearing a small gold collar), the 1st raven (wearing a small gold collar), the 1st husky (wearing a small gold collar), and the 1st black kitten (wearing a small gold collar).
In the room are Lilyth the Noble Secian (seated), Marinda the Secian (seated), Tigerlily the Anthian (seated), Pollii the Secian (seated), Zaheela the Leuian (seated, a raven upon her left shoulder), Wilomena the Noble Human (seated), Shaleu the Noble Leuian (seated), Julien the Leuian, Castin the Anthian (seated), Anyah the Human (seated), and Shleegulz the Go-blin-al (seated, a vulture upon his left shoulder).

Wilomena exclaims, "When asked o her child, she twisted her brow an cried, O, how my poor lass did bleed!"

Wilomena says, "An so th slavers swept her up an galloped back to th slavin town,"

Wilomena says, "Locked her away with no drink an no sup in a cell thirty feet underground."

Wilomena says, "Miles away, neath a great alder tree, a small Flerian lad did discover"

Wilomena says, "A tiny babe cryin out a hungry plea within her torn woolen cover."

Wilomena says, "Th lad held th child gainst his chest an ran off through th' afternoon sun"

Four sturdy walls and a roof of woven branches enclose this small tavern. From the forest floor, winding their way around the trunk of the Mother Tree, a set of intricately railed steps serve as the entrance and exit of the town of Treehaven. Strangers arriving at the top of the steps find themselves under the watchful eye of patrons seated at tables positioned about the light, airy room. A set of oak steps lead up to the new Council chambers.  An ivory inlaid pine bar, a wooden stool, a long weathered wooden bench, a long musty wooden table, some steps circling the tree, some freshly crafted oak steps, an open door, a paper covered posting board, a gilt framed painting on the wall, an open large straw basket, a closed forest green Elindalian book of prayers, a quiver of birch arrows, a bowl of billy goat gruff gruel, a bowl of billy goat gruff gruel, a bowl of billy goat gruff gruel, a brown potato, and an empty warm mug of Muldavian coffee are here.
