[Town Square Center.]

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.  A flowing white marble fountain, a marble statue of a Human, a shimmering marble statue of a Dragon, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a rosewood sign, a crisp gold lettered vellum notice, and a thick misty grey patch of swirling fog are here.

>[Market Circle.]

An arch between two large buildings connects Market Circle and Market Street. The more reputable shopkeepers do business within the circle, but pay higher taxes for the privilege. The buildings have been built to last, as these merchants are no traveling tinkers. Interlocking stone walkways and colorful plantings span this central area. Despite the number of animals waiting outside the bank for their owners, the area is spotless. Loud chatter in many languages can be heard from the southwest.  A marble archway, an open elegant gold-trimmed walnut door, and a wooden sign are here.

Market Street ends here at a large archway. People bustle in and out of the arch, some without so much as a nod. The city wall rises up to the south and west of the buildings of Market Circle. A small sign is posted on the wall beside the archway.  A street lantern is here.

Situated between the well-traveled Trade Way to the north and the fine shops of Market Circle to the south, this small stretch of road is busy at all times of day. Adventurers with sacks of plundered goods leave Market Street and head west where a shrewd businessman has set up shop in this busy area of the Market District. A small shop stands slightly to the east of the arch leading into Merchant Circle, light shining through its red glass door and illuminating the store front in a cheerful, ruby glow.  A street lantern, an opaque ruby red glass door, and a gold lettered wooden sign are here.

The buildings of Market Circle stand to the south. It becomes obvious that the area through the arch is a much cleaner marketplace than the bazaar. An inviting eatery stands beside the road, its door open to those weary after a long trip to Spur, as well as those preparing to venture to the great expanses beyond the west gate. A human couple exit the building, arm in arm. A small sign stands beside the intersection.  A sign, an open glossy lacquered oak door, and a street lantern are here.

Many townsfolk pass along this busy thoroughfare. Rich and poor alike mix freely on this street, much to the dismay of a passing nobleman. A young human struggles with an armful of packages and two young children in tow. Those in need of goods or supplies head west towards the market, those looking for the news of the day head east towards Town Square.  A street lantern is here.

A large gate separates the Merchant District and Town Square-the hub of Spur's activity. The partially opened gate is currently able to accommodate the simultaneous passage of several locals and visitors, but can be expanded to accept carriages, or sealed to ward against invasion.  Guards stand sentry from atop the wall as well as the ground.  A street lantern is here.

Merchant Walk comes to an abrupt end at a massive moonsilver gate.

Several city guardsmen have just finished wrestling to the ground some young tough thieves, who thought to rob one of the returning merchants. To one side a relieved-looking Fir Elf gentleman holds on tightly to his gold-tipped walking stick, as the human boy yells his innocence to any who might listen. His pleas fall on deaf ears as the guards drag him away.  A street lantern is here.

Merchants, some in frilly finery, others dressed in homespun wools, travel back and forth along this street on their way to and from work. They seem to blend together here, if only briefly.

A neatly kept park fronts this portion of Merchant Walk. Topiary and low shrubberies partition off small sections of the park.

People carrying bundles stream in from the west and rapidly lose themselves in the large crowds moving about in the vast town square.

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.  A flowing white marble fountain, a marble statue of a Human, a shimmering marble statue of a Dragon, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a rosewood sign, a crisp gold lettered vellum notice, and a thick misty grey patch of swirling fog are here.

The elegant Hotel Royale towers above the street, its emerald door sparkling in the light. The patrons that stroll in and out are catered to, doors opened and closed for them, and baggage and packages carried by harried servants. The large Bank of Spur sits on the east side of the square. Its location close to the Royale is not a coincidence. A gold-trimmed door is proof of the success of this branch of the Spurian bank and those who run it.  An elegant gold-trimmed walnut door, an open emerald steel door, a street lantern, and a new rosewood sign pointing southeast are here.

To the delight of those living in Spur, items usually available only in Saldea are now within easy walking distance. The displaced artisans and shopkeepers, although grateful, must surely chafe in such modest digs. Still, business is business. For the time being, they have a way to sell the wares they were able to spirit out of the city.  Some heavy moonsilver mail on a sturdy stand and an open door are here.

A well dressed Frontacian woman hurries along the path as two immaculately dressed Guards lead a criminal towards the jail. She sniffs in a haughty manner, and tips her hat down so she does not have to view the filth of the city.  A street lantern is here.

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.  A flowing white marble fountain, a marble statue of a Human, a shimmering marble statue of a Dragon, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a rosewood sign, a crisp gold lettered vellum notice, and a thick misty grey patch of swirling fog are here.

Travelers from Rathan to the northwest, and the Trade Route to the south, converge at Spur's west gate. Guards posted on the ground give those seeking to enter the city a cursory once-over. Their lack of interest shows that anyone approaching has already been observed from above for some time. A grate in the ground loosens mud from wagon wheels and hooves before they pass through the gate, helping to keep the streets of Spur fairly clean.

Travelers from Rathan to the northwest, and the Trade Route to the south, converge at Spur's west gate. Guards posted on the ground give those seeking to enter the city a cursory once-over. Their lack of interest shows that anyone approaching has already been observed from above for some time. A grate in the ground loosens mud from wagon wheels and hooves before they pass through the gate, helping to keep the streets of Spur fairly clean.  A closed giant black iron gate, a giant green oak tree, a small blue pool, a thick oak grate over the pool, and a polished stone marker are here.

In the dusty distance, Spur's great wall demarks the southern end of this well-traveled merchant's road. Soaring majestically to the north stands the spiky pinnacles and snow topped peaks of an epic mountain range so immense that it separates lands, races, and cultures. Connecting the two is a merchant road built long ago.

Lush grass grows up to the borders of a thick, dense forest that cloaks the hills to the west. The grasslands thin near the grove as the huge trees completely shade the ground, and are replaced by taller bushes and juniper trees.

A rickety criss-crossed rough beam fence pens the grazing of black and white cows whose ponderous forms are barely visible through the tall grass on either side of the road. To the north, the soft, undulating grassland floor of the wide valley succumbs to the rolling foothills, which in turn delineates the imposing outline of a vista-spanning mountain range. Many a traveler has witnessed this idyllic vantage point and has been drawn on to follow the road that travels into the heart of the mountains.

The road diverts around a small pool of murky water that lies to the north. A confusion of hoof prints muddies the shoreline where the placid bovines have come to water themselves. The pool is damned by a small hillock which allows no drainage so the pool remains stagnant. The mountains to the north reflect in perfectly upside-down symmetry on the still pond's surface, only wavering slightly in concentric circles to the deft touch of small insects.

Aged and splintered into the vague circular shape, a decaying wagon wheel is left to rot in the grass by the roadside. Their roots protectively sheltered from the weather, idiosyntric sprouts of taller grasses thrive haphazardly inside the wheel.

As the road bends around a curve, ruts left by merchant's wagons cut so deeply into the mud that all wheeled vehicles are forced to follow the set path. Four loaded wagons of a merchants caravan stand idle as one larger than standard wagon skitters along the path. The buckboard's frame groans and strains to keep it inline while the driver attempts to negotiate the turn. Four dark maned, matched mules balk at the noise behind them, and stomp nervously over the deep ruts. The liveried caravan guards attempt to haul the mules forward, further adding to the mules stubborn refusal to move.

The road charges across a flat valley through waving stalks of grain with coppery tinted seeds. Around the northern edge grows a row of huge cypress trees with trunks that measure eight feet across. Debris from the trees' self-trimming mats the taller grasses into an impenetrable wall. The cypresses produce the necessary windbreak for the field to bear the heavy headed grain.

Just to the north, the roadway curves gently around a bend in a large river that flows towards the southeast. An enormous smooth round rock splits off a small eddy from the main current resulting a deep, clear pool by the eastern side of the road. The cool calm water catches the reflection of the white snowcapped mountain range further up the valley while the river rushes past towards Spur. Five fishermen recline on folding chairs or against rocks, tethered by the silvery lines of their poles to the fishing hole. Each fisherman is spread evenly around the pool as if held apart by some invisible barrier as they eye the large shadowy fish shapes finning effortlessly against the mild current in the eddy.

The decaying remains of the bridge workers camp sprawls across this flat valley. To house their draft beasts, the workers constructed small stalls and shelters from rickety boards nailed quixotically to the standing trees. Three brass ring topped posts lie sunk into the grasslands turf, to the south, which was most likely used for tethering grazing animals. Between the posts is a rough stone trough that is filled automatically with water by a rickety mechanical wind mill, whirling lazily in the breeze.

Running parallel to the road is a smooth rock lined trench that channels the road's run-off during rainstorms. This flat part of the road that follows the valley floor would be prone to turn into a muddy bog and therefore a hazard to most caravans and their pack animals. Anticipating this event, the road's engineers built drains into the lower side of the road that carry the runoff into the culvert, which carries it harmlessly down to the low end of the valley.

Low growing leather ferns cover the soft forest floor amidst the thick layer of pine needle mulch.  To the northeast, low mounds of dull orange mud and rocks circle a clearing in the trees.

Just west of the merchant road, a semi-circle of low domed mud hovels follow a large bend in the stream.  The sluggish stream fills the large, quiet pool that has accumulated behind a gentle cataract of rocks. Nothing disturbs the silken waters surface but a few fish seeking their insect meals.

Resembling mud hovels, haphazardly stacked balls of ochre mud surround the quiet, deep pool. The mud 'homes' are evenly spaced with great care and strange secretions surround the far sides.  Several large, flat stones half-submerged in the water cross the shallow end of the pool, each marked with the recent drippings and wet footprints of a large beast with long toes and sharp claws.

A sharp splash in the calm pool sends ripples down the stream and echoes off the narrow valley's walls.  The soft shush of slithering scales brushing against bushes and trees warns of an impending confrontation with the villages inhabitants. Three large male lizardmen duck out of one of the mud hovels doorway and sprint into hiding.

The merchant road follows the wandering path of the small stream. Towering pine trees grow thickly in this hidden forest.  Delicate, ground hugging ferns, thorny brambles with glossy leaves, and mountain laurels grow densely along the vale in the light shade of the pines. Bright green mosses cover the stream bank as the sluggish water ebbs to the southeast.

Slender needled pine trees tower over the merchant road as it passes through this small hidden canyon. The forest is a wonder of life in the barren reaches of the steppe: a small microcosm of life densely packed into a narrow crack in the harsh rocky terrain.

The north end of a hidden pine tree forest abutts a stone outcropping. This small box ended canyon shelters the verdant green trees and a small sluggish stream as if protecting them from the broken backbones of bedrock and undulating dirt and rocks strewn to the north.

The merchant road follows the path of least resistance through the broken, rocky, higher foothills.  What is a well engineered road in the tamer steppe-lands becomes a minor miracle through the rougher hills and valleys. The road bed remains flat and easy to travel despite the rocky terrain. Each incline and decline in the road is fixed to an agreeable grade for most wagons and sleds.   An open spotted wool pouch and an open muddy tigerskin sack are here.

Following a ravine in the cliffs of the higher foothills, the merchant road by-passes a jagged rock formation that repeats in a row from north to south for miles.  Like the decaying backbone of a huge creature buried in soil, the shattered rocks points their broken ribs to the northeast.

Following a small ridge of a hill, the merchant road cuts through the west side, protecting it from the gusty winds that barrels down the mountain sides. The tall pine trees that have begun to populate the higher foothills lean away from the mountains due to the wind's continuous blowing.

The merchant road cuts straight through a hill where men and beasts must have toiled to remove tons of blasted rock and dirt. The choice to remove hundreds of feet of hillside was more prudent to the road engineers then a long series of switch-backs that would have to climb the steep hillside for hundreds of feet. Tube shaped holes drilled into the bedrock still remain from when the roadbed was blasted eons ago.

A solid brass smelted road marker was made to fit perfectly into a cylinder carved in a large boulder. The boulder is pure white crystal quartz, fractured and broken into beautiful prisms around the edges, but remains whole and pure in the center. The road marker clearly points out the cardinal directions using four arrows.   A solid brass road marker is here.

Protected by an outcropping of the rocks that tops another high hill, an oasis of vibrant green mosses reveal a small spring that barely dampens the rocky soil. An industrious and thirsty traveler has coaxed the tricklet of water through a small trench that slowly fills a shallow stone basin. The granite basin holds only enough water to fill a few waterbags.

The jagged mountains and snow capped peaks cannot be viewed along this portion of the merchant road, due to the proximity of the range.  Deep valleys and steep hillsides further hinder any vantage points other then straight ahead and behind.  For all intents and purposes, the mountains do not exist in this passage through the rippled land.

The merchant road dips down into a small valley with steep walls, cutting across the incline like a switch-back to reduce the grade.  This long but narrow canyon is tree-less and full of gravel and broken rocks. As if to emphasize the strangeness of the sheered rocks, a line of split stone expands across the very center of the valley.

The sandy soil of the steppe has been ripped away to reveal its intimate underpinnings.  The matted roots of the prairie grasses desperately hold into what little dirt they can while below in wide layers, the rocks and dirt tell the story of the plateau and the surrounding foothills. Each striation varies in texture, composition and color. They are an open book for those with the specific knowledge to read it.

The merchant road threads through bottom of the small, narrow valley. Sheer granite walls block the view from the well traveled road to either side and above, only a narrow ray of sky testifies to the time of day. The engineers set a route as far as possible from the broken stones in the center of the valley and, by luck or design, this foresight has saved the road-bed from constant reconstruction. Small cracks run parallel to the road, but none have broken through the thick layers of sand and stone.

Tumbled boulders and landslides fan down from the crumbling walls of the valley. In the more narrow spots, the alluvial fans of debris clog the roadway and the practical merchants and their caravans have had to devise small detours around the bigger obstacles.

One layer of rock in the steep walls has eroded faster then the harder granite or bedrock above and below it. Soft sandstone has been stripped away to form an arch in the valley wall ... a concave indention that goes for hundreds of feet in both directions.  Within the hardened sediment left ages ago upon the land are treasures beyond value: fossilized shells by the thousands, in all sizes, shapes and colors.

The momentous forces that have wrought this valley still press upon the land and have done so for eons.  The walls of the valley are sheer and steep, and untouched by the raging waters of river or stream.  As if in testimony to the power of the forces that move the land, a huge dark boulder sits off to the side of the road. It is hewn in half like a sliced melon.  One part sits 20 feet north along the break in the rocks from the other part.

A short vibration shudders the roadbed, causing dust and gravel to shimmy down the canyon walls. A few larger rocks ping and ricochet off boulders, until all is deadly silent.  The merchant road is dusted with bits of broken rock, covering any recent tracks.

The rocky valley walls widen to the accommodate the splitting of the Tarath fault line. The Great Divide towers to the north beyond the fractured, broken badlands. Sheer, monolithic cliffs dropping for thousands of feet front the western edge of the mountains; their sharp, snow-capped peaks vaulting nearly vertically from the floor of the fault line valley. The merchant road bed is cracked and broken as it negotiates the larger twists and turns.

A short tremor suddenly rocks the cracked merchant road! A dusty pall sifts into the air from cracks in the ground and the shifting of gravel around the valley.  The tremor rolls through the canyon walls like a ripple, as if it were a linen sheet that was lifted and settled again. Pack animals and travelers alike stop momentarily and then hasten their pace as if to leave the quake behind them.

As the merchant road approaches the western end of the valley, the valley wall abruptly falls away to a sheer drop. Crumbling rock and dirt spill constantly into the deep abyss. Sections of the mountain have slid away into the valley and the merchant road has been rebuilt higher along the steeper sides of the mountain. The fault line of broken rocks continues its path of destruction to the west, skirted by the land-slide prone softer dirt.   A freshly uncovered crevice is here.

A treacherous dusty trail leads west along the shaky fault line from a fork in the main road. The original roadbed has fallen into the chasm years ago, leaving the merchants to their own wiles to ply the slippery slopes past the fault zone. Many attempts have failed at conquering the shifting dirt and rocks. Currently a bumpy trail skirts the bigger rocks and loose gravel.

You stand before a gate about 3 feet high, yellowing and rusty from years of use. It doesn't look like anyone takes care of it regularly. A sign is sticking out of the ground off the side of the path, slightly crooked. The writing on the board is crudely scrawled into the wood, reading "Wolf Trap". You can only assume that is the name given to the quiet town seen past the gate.  An open rusting gate is here.
