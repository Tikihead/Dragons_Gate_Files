Sangaril looks like a 5'0" standard young delicate boned, stocky bodied San Elf.
She is seated.
She has collar length, curly, coarse reddish black hair, with pitch black eyes, and looks casual.
She appears to be annoyed right now.
She bears the mark of Unknown.
She can be attacked by other players.

On her left shoulder is a white swirled rising teardrop of Grace.

She appears to be in perfect health.

Seemingly busy with her work, managing rental properities. This Sanene female seems to be lost in the thoughts of her business and personal thoughts

On the south side of the road a handsome two-story building a sign hanging on the front is carved with the single word, "Office."

The white road is made up of identically sized white stones that are so perfectly fitted together it is hard to tell that the road is not one long single piece. A single wooden bench sits under one of the larger trees, a nice place to rest and reflect.  A closed large pine gate is here.

The broad expanse of lawn is dotted with pine cones and various animals. The wind blowing through the tall pine trees whistles as the mighty branches sway and dance far above. The white stone road splits as it heads towards the east, leading towards several sets of low slung bungalows. On the north side of the road a small cottage sits nestled among the trees. On the south side of the road a handsome two-story building a sign hanging on the front is carved with the single word, "Office."  A closed intricate steelwood door and a closed solid bluesteel door are here.

Forming an "L" shape, four cute white bungalows sit along the east and south edge of a large courtyard. Each home has a garden filled with lush flowers, small bushes and miniature trees, surrounded by a white picket fence. The doors of the little bungalows are all different colors, as if to match the personality of the owner. The lush lawn that spreads out to the north and another matching set of homes is dotted with smaller pine trees, pine cones littering the ground and occasionally squirrels popping their head out of their homes to take in the scenery.  A closed grey pine door, a closed pale yellow pine door, a closed brown pine door, and a closed deep crimson pine door are here.

Along the front of this beautifully decorated bungalow are six tall windows. Each of them framed with pale yellow curtains. A light oak floor is accented with a deep yellow rug that catches the daylight and holds the warmth all through the evening hours. Tucked under the back eves is a beautiful oak and rope bed. Its feather filled mattress is covered with a dark blue coverlet embroidered with a yellow sunburst. Pillows of pale blue, pale yellow and white cover the bed. A blue and yellow striped sofa resides pleasantly in front of the tall windows, a small table sits to the side where it can easily be pulled in front of the sofa in order to enjoy a meal or write a scroll.  A closed rope trimmed oak chest and an open pale yellow pine door are here.

Tall bookcases cover the back wall of this bungalow. A small window in the front is easily opened to let in enough light for studying, but also can remain closed in order to maintain the quiet peacefulness of this home. Two red leather wing-back chairs sit on either side of a small walnut table. Hanging above each chair is a lamp capable of illuminating any reading material. Against the east wall is a comfortable four-poster bed. A thick crimson coverlet is tucked in neatly on all four sides. Carefully placed on the opposite wall of the bed is a small dinner table and two chairs, next to them is a polished walnut chest with a small doily set neatly on top.   Some tall walnut bookcases, a closed polished walnut chest, and an open deep crimson pine door are here.

Pale grey walls accent this neatly furnished bungalow. All items are carefully in place, taking up as little space as possible. A huge picture window looks over the grassy courtyard and both allows the daylight to flow into the room and a wonderful view of the evening stars. Facing the window is a large overstuffed deep blue sofa. A large moonsilver chest doubles as a table and a foot rest in front of the sofa. Against the northern wall is a polished oak table, resplendent with four high backed chairs. Folded up against the southern wall is a large bed, which opens when needed, staying well out of the way during the day.  A closed large moonsilver chest, an open large comfortable folding bed, and an open grey pine door are here.

Dark colors seem to dominate this small bungalow. While comfortable, it is readily apparent this room was decorated with a male in mind. Dark woods cover the floor and the walls, as the same colored beams stretch across the high ceiling. The heads of several different creatures dot the wall above a warm brick fireplace. A small bed resides in the corner, a simple deep green coverlet thrown haphazardly over it. Centered in the room is a dark blue sofa which looks hardly used. Against the front wall is a large oak table surrounded by six large chairs. Maps, small lead creatures and men, and various accouterments of war planning sit meticulously upon the table as if waiting to be utilized.  A closed dark oak chest and an open brown pine door are here.

On the south side of the road a handsome two-story building a sign hanging on the front is carved with the single word, "Office."

[Raine Estates.]

Several majestic willow trees, with their long drooping branches, stand at the top of a gently sloping hill. A slight wind blows among the trees and grass in this flowery meadow while a trickling stream flows among the boulders at the bottom of a small hill. Home to many small animals, patches of tall grass and several bushes grow around the stream.  A large willow tree is here.

[Cobblestone Lane.]

Adjacent to the street lanterns, two wooden benches lay next to the cobblestone path. A fluttering yellow and orange butterfly flits back and forth amongst large lilac trees displaying their purple hues. A gentle breeze picks up the sweet scent of the purple flowers and carries it across the lane.  A colorful cobblestone path, a glowing tall wrought iron street lantern, a rosewood bench, and a flowering lilac tree are here.

[Cobblestone Lane.]

Several well placed street lanterns line the well kept cobblestone path. A towering oak tree sits off to the side of the path. Its leaves blow and twist displaying its various mint green colors. Nestled in its branches several blue birds call back and forth to one another in song. Floating grey clouds pass by overhead.  An open large wrought iron gate, a colorful cobblestone path, and a glowing tall wrought iron street lantern are here.

[Shoteron Way.]

A low hedge grows between the Spurian Wall and the street. Flowers bloom on the hedge, and cheer up what might be a dreary view. Two guards lean over the tall wall and call down greetings to those who pass. At any time of the day, one may pass a Fir Elf on the way to market, or a Hithual stumbling home to sleep.  A street lantern and an open large wrought iron gate are here.

[Shoteron Way.]

A shadowy black twisted free form metal sculpture stands on a small patch of grass at the beginning of Shoteron Way. Its unique design catches the light of both the sun and the moon. Below the memorial are several small items that have been left in passing. The well-manicured cobblestone path shows signs that it is well traveled, with enough room for even the largest cart or Leuian family.  A street lantern is here.

[Law Road & Shoteron Way.]

Law Road from the south and Shoteron Way from the east join before turning toward Town Square to the northwest. If one stays at this location long enough, they see the irony of these two roads joining. Most who are escorted south along Law Road are the criminals and ne'er-do-wells of the Spur, while those travel along Shoteron Way are the upper class residents whom live further east. Two office building, the City Planners Office and the Archmage's office stand on opposite sides of the road, each one neatly kept and freshly painted.  A street lantern and a closed morbius door are here.

[Gateway.]

You are just inside the gateway between the Justice District and the Town Square. Most of those heading into the Justice District have a grim look about them. Then again, it could just be the chains. A small sign stands off to the side.  An open iron gate, a street lantern, and a wooden sign are here.

[Right Street.]

Right Street ends at a gateway leading to the Housing and Administration District. Those living in this portion of town travel comfortably either by conveyance or by foot. Beautiful flowers grow on both sides of the well tended, freshly painted gate. In front, standing crisply at attention, a Guard tips his hat in greeting to all those who pass.  An open iron gate and a street lantern are here.

[Right Street.]

A large wagon sits on the side of the street, its load having shifted and then toppled over. A Usil driver yells at his two Oog-ra helpers, explaining to them that the armoire should be sitting upright and not on its side. They scratch themselves in confusion, and you can hear them muttering something about leaving it on its side, so it does not fall again. There will be a resident who is unhappy with their purchase this evening.  A street lantern is here.

[Right Street.]

A neatly trimmed hedge with a small strip of grass fronts the road that travels between the Spurian Housing District and the center of town. A well dressed Frontacian woman hurries along the path as two immaculately dressed Guards lead a criminal towards the jail. She sniffs in a haughty manner, and tips her hat down so she does not have to view the filth of the city.  A street lantern is here.

A polished wooden bench sits in front of a neatly trimmed hedge. It is the perfect spot for those who wish to rest and allow their pets or children to play along the grass fronting the roadway. A small stone well complete with a dipper stands ready to slake the thirst of those who travel this way or who need a breather.  A small stone well and a street lantern are here.

[Right Street.]

The road between the center of town and the housing district is well kept and maintained. Ruts are immediately repaired and small bushes and flowers line the way. The class of people that travel this way are better dressed and obviously of a higher class. Occasionally guards can be seen taking criminals towards the jail in an efficient and orderly manner.  A street lantern and a pair of open wide mahogany doors are here.

[Town Square.]

The elegant Hotel Royale towers above the street, its emerald door sparkling in the light. The patrons that stroll in and out are catered to, doors opened and closed for them, and baggage and packages carried by harried servants. The large Bank of Spur sits on the east side of the square. Its location close to the Royale is not a coincidence. A gold-trimmed door is proof of the success of this branch of the Spurian bank and those who run it.  An elegant gold-trimmed walnut door, open emerald steel door, and a street lantern are here.

[Town Square Center.]

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.   A flowing white marble fountain, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a cracked marble statue of a Human, a carved marble statue of a Dragon, a rosewood sign, some flaming ruby ashes, a deep fluffy snow drift, a broken wooden cart wheel, and a large waterskin are here.
