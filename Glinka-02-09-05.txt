The bottleneck widens gradually to reveal a dank underground grotto awash in an otherworldly glow. Drooping tendrilled fungi splotch the striated sandstone cavern ceiling. The thick stalks of the fungi are topped with a head of hundreds of filaments that end with a glowing lavender nodule, giving the entire chamber an eldritch luminescence. A thick carpet of lush burgundy moss blankets the ground and runs up the walls in several instances, thinning into sparse clumps the higher it goes. Where the moss stops its climb, bone-white shelf fungi replaces it; each successive layer jutting further out into the tunnel until reaching the ceiling. Growing in no discernable manner on top of the moss are billowy balloon mushrooms, each easily four feet in radius. Their diaphanous membranes show millions of spores waiting to be exhaled out a small mouth if disturbed. Rounding out the fungal flora are several groups of seven foot tall toadstools, each displaying a dazzling array of shifting fluorescence on their caps.   A large oval sandstone hole in the wall is here.

>[Cylindrical Tunnel.]

The walls of this sloping tunnel are unlike any other found in the network of caverns. Certain sections of the normally porous sandstone are glossy, almost glass-like. Other parts of the passage appear to have melted and bubbled, leaving behind small craters and fist sized lumps in the rock face. The floor is smooth like red-streaked obsidian, seared by the intense heat that can only be generated by dragon flame.   A round carved sandstone tunnel mouth and a narrow black opening are here.

>[Circular Pit, Dragon Cavern.]

A winding tunnel opens above a large depression in the cavern floor. A wide ledge spirals its way down the contour of the circular pit, narrowing as it approaches the flat bed of the bottom. The upper concentric circles of the ledge accommodate several rocks. The large rocks are not made of the abundant sandstone of the caves; rather, they are chiseled obsidian. Most have narrow slits for claw perches, while some are crudely hewn into bowl shapes for seating. Sound reverberates magnificently within the bowl, causing any sound above a whisper to carry to any point in the chamber.   A ledge winding downward, a giant glossy black obsidian rock, a giant glossy black obsidian rock, a slick mottled obsidian bowl-shaped rock, a slick mottled obsidian bowl-shaped rock, and a round carved sandstone tunnel mouth are here.

>[Basin Rim, Dragon Cavern.]

A steep ramp of tightly packed clay, rocks, and detritus descends into a deep basin formed in the sandstone floor of the cavern. The smooth floor of the basin implies natural formation, but deep claw gouges along the sides, although smoothed by the passage of time, bespeak draconic assistance. From the rim of the basin a phantasmal form is visible. Standing perfectly still at the center of the basin it appears statuesque. A sudden flurry of graceful yet precise movement reveals the apparition to be progressing through a series of increasingly complex fighting stances and maneuvers. Each sharp jab, stab, slash, and cut is demonstrated wielding a gleaming scimitar in one hand and a short curved dagger in the other.   A ramp leading down is here.

[Cavern Entrance.]

By swift passage of flood waters, or slow percolating of artesian wells, the towering walls of this sandstone cavern were eroded into eery eliptical shapes, creating an underground network of winding passages. Dozens of misshapen tunnels, chambers, and alcoves start or end in this cavern, their inky black mouths dotting the walls in every direction and height. Apertures in the uneven ground plunge thousands of feet through dripping mists and down into the dark bowels of the earth. Lining the cavern mouth exiting to the forested path are two precisely carved semicircles, one within the other. Their borders are cut several inches deep into the walls and the sandstone has been reinforced with a metallic substance within the double arch. Filling the gaps between the dual arches are deeply gouged draconic runes, glyphs, and wards, each crackling with pent-up azure energy.  A massive stone cavern opening is here.

[Forest path.]

The towering trees of the forest begin their ascension of the large mountain seen from the open plains of New South Lake. The root holds are precarious, as the mountain's face is especially steep on the northern side. The muddy path concludes in front of a sheer stone wall covered with verdant patches of green moss. A numbing breeze blows outward from the depths a massive cavern mouth, as if the mountain itself was exhaling ice-chilled breath. Deep-cut symbols grace the sides of the cavern entrance. They appear to be recently completed, as time, water, and weather have not yet dulled the sharp lines of the cuts.  A massive stone cavern is here.

A wide, shallow sheet of water forms as two shallow streams join in the gully that accompanies the forest path. A kingfisher watches the shallows with hungered interest; several dragonflies skim the water, while water striders skate along the its surface. The soaring oak, ash, and pine trees do a fair, but not complete, job of blocking the jutting mountain to the south.

The shall stream that serves as the trail's guide is lazy, taking its time. The water murmurs softly to itself as it stumbles over mossy stones and slides beneath large sentinel oaks and pines.

The forest path requires constant twisting and turning to navigate undeterred through the obstacle course of fallen trunks, thick spider webs, and lush fern and ivy growth. Though not obvious at first glance, a game trail does indeed snake its way through the rotting leaves and pine needles that make up the padded forest floor.

An ever-present breeze rustles the leaves of the old, ominous oak trees that the forest path meanders through.

The path continues into the forest to the south, its serpentine nature lending to the ancient forest a means to disguise the final destination.

What was once a very well used trade route has slowed to some caravans bringing supplies for the townsmen and the occasional merchants traveling from the far southern reaches of the land. Many guards protect this section of the fort as it is home to some wild beasts that live outside these walls. In the distance, you can make out two more guards hunting the frogmen that often try to attack the city and caravans.  An open large sturdy wooden gate and a glowing wrought iron lantern are here.

[Forest path.]

An ever-present breeze rustles the leaves of the old, ominous oak trees that the forest path meanders through. A few tall pine trees are sprinkled throughout the expanse of oaks, contributing their needles and cones to the ocassional forest shower of wind dislodged debris. The path continues into the forest to the south, its serpentine nature lending to the ancient forest a means to disguise the final destination.  A path and some glowing enchanted twinkling diamond candles are here.

[Forest path.]

The forest path requires constant twisting and turning to navigate undeterred through the obstacle course of fallen trunks, thick spider webs, and lush fern and ivy growth. Though not obvious at first glance, a game trail does indeed snake its way through the rotting leaves and pine needles that make up the padded forest floor. A bright red cardinal, frightened by your sudden presence, takes wing and quickly vanishes, consumed by thick greenery all around.  Some glowing enchanted twinkling diamond candles are here.

The forest path follows a muddy gully eroded by a shallow stream. Tall pine and oak trees tower above both sides of the muddy banks. Large mossy stones force the stream to twist and turn as it flows slowly south. The ground seems to be sloping downward slightly as the stream cuts back to the southeast.

The shall stream that serves as the trail's guide is lazy, taking its time. The water murmurs softly to itself as it stumbles over mossy stones and slides beneath large sentinel oaks and pines. The season's leaves decorate the stream's ripples, their greens and browns dappled with shadow and the bit of light allowed to pass through the canopy.

A wide, shallow sheet of water forms as two shallow streams join in the gully that accompanies the forest path. A kingfisher watches the shallows with hungered interest; several dragonflies skim the water, while water striders skate along the its surface. The soaring oak, ash, and pine trees do a fair, but not complete, job of blocking the jutting mountain to the south.

[Forest path.]

The towering trees of the forest begin their ascension of the large mountain seen from the open plains of New South Lake. The root holds are precarious, as the mountain's face is especially steep on the northern side. The muddy path concludes in front of a sheer stone wall covered with verdant patches of green moss. A numbing breeze blows outward from the depths a massive cavern mouth, as if the mountain itself was exhaling ice-chilled breath. Deep-cut symbols grace the sides of the cavern entrance. They appear to be recently completed, as time, water, and weather have not yet dulled the sharp lines of the cuts.  A massive stone cavern is here.

>[Cavern Entrance.]

By swift passage of flood waters, or slow percolating of artesian wells, the towering walls of this sandstone cavern were eroded into eery eliptical shapes, creating an underground network of winding passages. Dozens of misshapen tunnels, chambers, and alcoves start or end in this cavern, their inky black mouths dotting the walls in every direction and height. Apertures in the uneven ground plunge thousands of feet through dripping mists and down into the dark bowels of the earth. Lining the cavern mouth exiting to the forested path are two precisely carved semicircles, one within the other. Their borders are cut several inches deep into the walls and the sandstone has been reinforced with a metallic substance within the double arch. Filling the gaps between the dual arches are deeply gouged draconic runes, glyphs, and wards, each crackling with pent-up azure energy.  A massive stone cavern opening is here.

>[Basin Rim, Dragon Cavern.]

A steep ramp of tightly packed clay, rocks, and detritus descends into a deep basin formed in the sandstone floor of the cavern. The smooth floor of the basin implies natural formation, but deep claw gouges along the sides, although smoothed by the passage of time, bespeak draconic assistance. From the rim of the basin a phantasmal form is visible. Standing perfectly still at the center of the basin it appears statuesque. A sudden flurry of graceful yet precise movement reveals the apparition to be progressing through a series of increasingly complex fighting stances and maneuvers. Each sharp jab, stab, slash, and cut is demonstrated wielding a gleaming scimitar in one hand and a short curved dagger in the other.   A ramp leading down is here.

[Circular Pit, Dragon Cavern.]

A winding tunnel opens above a large depression in the cavern floor. A wide ledge spirals its way down the contour of the circular pit, narrowing as it approaches the flat bed of the bottom. The upper concentric circles of the ledge accommodate several rocks. The large rocks are not made of the abundant sandstone of the caves; rather, they are chiseled obsidian. Most have narrow slits for claw perches, while some are crudely hewn into bowl shapes for seating. Sound reverberates magnificently within the bowl, causing any sound above a whisper to carry to any point in the chamber.   A ledge winding downward, a giant glossy black obsidian rock, a giant glossy black obsidian rock, a slick mottled obsidian bowl-shaped rock, a slick mottled obsidian bowl-shaped rock, and a round carved sandstone tunnel mouth are here.

The walls of this sloping tunnel are unlike any other found in the network of caverns. Certain sections of the normally porous sandstone are glossy, almost glass-like. Other parts of the passage appear to have melted and bubbled, leaving behind small craters and fist sized lumps in the rock face. The floor is smooth like red-streaked obsidian, seared by the intense heat that can only be generated by dragon flame.   A round carved sandstone tunnel mouth and a narrow black opening are here.

The bottleneck widens gradually to reveal a dank underground grotto awash in an otherworldly glow. Drooping tendrilled fungi splotch the striated sandstone cavern ceiling. The thick stalks of the fungi are topped with a head of hundreds of filaments that end with a glowing lavender nodule, giving the entire chamber an eldritch luminescence. A thick carpet of lush burgundy moss blankets the ground and runs up the walls in several instances, thinning into sparse clumps the higher it goes. Where the moss stops its climb, bone-white shelf fungi replaces it; each successive layer jutting further out into the tunnel until reaching the ceiling. Growing in no discernable manner on top of the moss are billowy balloon mushrooms, each easily four feet in radius. Their diaphanous membranes show millions of spores waiting to be exhaled out a small mouth if disturbed. Rounding out the fungal flora are several groups of seven foot tall toadstools, each displaying a dazzling array of shifting fluorescence on their caps.   A large oval sandstone hole in the wall is here.

The bottleneck widens gradually to reveal a dank underground grotto awash in an otherworldly glow. Drooping tendrilled fungi splotch the striated sandstone cavern ceiling. The thick stalks of the fungi are topped with a head of hundreds of filaments that end with a glowing lavender nodule, giving the entire chamber an eldritch luminescence. A thick carpet of lush burgundy moss blankets the ground and runs up the walls in several instances, thinning into sparse clumps the higher it goes. Where the moss stops its climb, bone-white shelf fungi replaces it; each successive layer jutting further out into the tunnel until reaching the ceiling. Growing in no discernable manner on top of the moss are billowy balloon mushrooms, each easily four feet in radius. Their diaphanous membranes show millions of spores waiting to be exhaled out a small mouth if disturbed. Rounding out the fungal flora are several groups of seven foot tall toadstools, each displaying a dazzling array of shifting fluorescence on their caps.   A large oval sandstone hole in the wall is here.

Verbaniah asks, "Why would I not have?"

Clara is now apprehensive.

Weldoian says, "While in battle, we can each do our individual healing techniques."

Bodhi asks Verbaniah in Secian, "because you were so excited to come see such a large gathering of drakes you forgot?"

Weldoian shrugs slightly.

Twilight asks, "What if we agree to not use the group heal and vigors at all, unless an emergency?"

Julia nods up and down to Weldoian.

A winding tunnel opens above a large depression in the cavern floor. A wide ledge spirals its way down the contour of the circular pit, narrowing as it approaches the flat bed of the bottom. The upper concentric circles of the ledge accommodate several rocks. The large rocks are not made of the abundant sandstone of the caves; rather, they are chiseled obsidian. Most have narrow slits for claw perches, while some are crudely hewn into bowl shapes for seating. Sound reverberates magnificently within the bowl, causing any sound above a whisper to carry to any point in the chamber.   A ledge winding downward, a giant glossy black obsidian rock, a giant glossy black obsidian rock, a slick mottled obsidian bowl-shaped rock, a slick mottled obsidian bowl-shaped rock, and a round carved sandstone tunnel mouth are here.

[Basin Rim, Dragon Cavern.]

A steep ramp of tightly packed clay, rocks, and detritus descends into a deep basin formed in the sandstone floor of the cavern. The smooth floor of the basin implies natural formation, but deep claw gouges along the sides, although smoothed by the passage of time, bespeak draconic assistance. From the rim of the basin a phantasmal form is visible. Standing perfectly still at the center of the basin it appears statuesque. A sudden flurry of graceful yet precise movement reveals the apparition to be progressing through a series of increasingly complex fighting stances and maneuvers. Each sharp jab, stab, slash, and cut is demonstrated wielding a gleaming scimitar in one hand and a short curved dagger in the other.   A ramp leading down is here.

[Cavern Entrance.]

By swift passage of flood waters, or slow percolating of artesian wells, the towering walls of this sandstone cavern were eroded into eery eliptical shapes, creating an underground network of winding passages. Dozens of misshapen tunnels, chambers, and alcoves start or end in this cavern, their inky black mouths dotting the walls in every direction and height. Apertures in the uneven ground plunge thousands of feet through dripping mists and down into the dark bowels of the earth. Lining the cavern mouth exiting to the forested path are two precisely carved semicircles, one within the other. Their borders are cut several inches deep into the walls and the sandstone has been reinforced with a metallic substance within the double arch. Filling the gaps between the dual arches are deeply gouged draconic runes, glyphs, and wards, each crackling with pent-up azure energy.  A massive stone cavern opening is here.

[Forest path.]

The towering trees of the forest begin their ascension of the large mountain seen from the open plains of New South Lake. The root holds are precarious, as the mountain's face is especially steep on the northern side. The muddy path concludes in front of a sheer stone wall covered with verdant patches of green moss. A numbing breeze blows outward from the depths a massive cavern mouth, as if the mountain itself was exhaling ice-chilled breath. Deep-cut symbols grace the sides of the cavern entrance. They appear to be recently completed, as time, water, and weather have not yet dulled the sharp lines of the cuts.  A massive stone cavern is here.

A wide, shallow sheet of water forms as two shallow streams join in the gully that accompanies the forest path.

The forest path requires constant twisting and turning to navigate undeterred through the obstacle course of fallen trunks, thick spider webs, and lush fern and ivy growth.

An ever-present breeze rustles the leaves of the old, ominous oak trees that the forest path meanders through.

With Meetpoint at your heels this rugged old cobblestone bridge leads to the Southern Plains and the main trade routes from spur and Meetpoint to the Southernmost reaches of the lands. Signs that this road was once well traveled by the hustle and bustle of laden carts are plain to view. Though, with the hardened clay-like mud and the fact that it has not rained here in some time it is obvious that these tracks are very old.

A few guards do a roving patrol of the area and down to the bridge. They check the caravans before they enter and anyone that looks suspicious they throw into the river.

Here a gate leads out of the fort and into the Southern regions. Several children run and play just inside the gate, under the watchful eyes of the guards. What was once a very well used trade route has slowed to some caravans bringing supplies for the townsmen and the occasional merchants traveling from the far southern reaches of the land. Many guards protect this section of the fort as it is home to some wild beasts that live outside these walls. In the distance, you can make out two more guards hunting the frogmen that often try to attack the city and caravans.  An open large sturdy wooden gate and a glowing wrought iron lantern are here.

Within the heart of this proud fort one can see all around that the reconstruction of its buildings has begun. Large stones and logs have been stacked and piled, while some workers tirelessly attempt to repair the damage that occurred here during the Lords of Chaos wars. The buildings and homes of the people that resided here are slowly taking shape, though, far from completed. The smell of dyes, used to paint the town, permeate the area.  A breathtaking shimmering bouquet of moonflowers, an open light blue door, and a glowing wrought iron street lantern are here.

Through the slates of the wooden walkways, you can make out four archers playing a game of cards, weapons at the ready. A whip cracks loudly as a caravan heads out the gate towards Spur.  An open wooden gate is here.

Rising up out of the plains, a large walled fort receives the end of the stone road. The river flows from either side, running through the fort from this angle of view. The vegetation surrounding the tradeway at this point hasrecently, allowing a clear field of vision from the tops of the walls ahead. The stones show little wear from the heavy traffic.

The grass rises taller and taller in every direction further limiting view just off the roadside. A second glance reveals that this is the lowest point in a large, shallow depression. The tradeway sinks a little lower as it gets closer to the river off to the west. A ditch runs alongside the river's side of the road, small puddles of water filling the bottom. Trickles filter into the puddles from the grass beyond as mosquitoes dart across the muddy surfaces.

Only the well-built, stone tradeway gives any hint of civilization ever having had any presence here. The tall grasses limit visibility nearby, hiding any wildlife that may be waiting for prey to stumble too close. A few blades of grass sway slightly in the breeze, some of them broken by the passing of something heavy over them. One of the larger stones in the road, broken loose from its mortar, waits patiently to be repaired.

The stone paved tradeway stretches across the open plains, interrupting nature's task of consuming the land. An endless sea of grass surrounds you, lapping at the road much like the tides against a beach. The faintly damp wind occasionally blowing in from the west smells of earth. Some of the stones in the road interlock together to form the crude image of a lion. There is no discerning if it was done on purpose or sheer accident.

The tradeway runs across the open grasslands northeast towards the Spur, and southwest towards distant lands and eventually, the coast. The plains to the south and east seem totally indifferent to your existence. Just ahead, a small path moves up a village of huts spread out in a semi-circle. In the center of the village a giant fire pit sits where barbarians who wander through the village can sit around to stay warm.  A worn grassy path is here.

Set within a wide tunnel leading through the hedge to the north is the Wilderness Gate. It separates the settled lands of Spur from the open plains to the south of the city. The plains stretch as far as the eyes can see, the horizon and the walls of the fort down the road the only blemishes of the grassy landscape in the distance. The stones of the road are smoothly set together, well built to withstand heavy travel. A broken wagon wheel, discarded some time ago, covers a spot of nearby grass, weeds trying to climb through the spokes.  An open bronze gate is here.

Through the gate lies the city of Spur, the major center of trade and civilization on the plains. The dusty road leading through the gates is well traveled, and walls of the city are in good repair. A small shack sits to the west of the road, during most times of the day a dusty coach can be seen waiting in front, its horses stomping with impatience to be gone. To the right of the door is a small window, its opening covered with metal bars. An old man, missing most of his teeth, waits patiently for the travelers to pay their fare, and then directs them into the waiting area. On the east side of the road a billowing multicolored tent has been erected, the hustle and bustle of merchants and customers can be seen coming and going at all times of the day.  An open iron gate and a rainbow silk tent are here.

The area brightens.
[Melted Alcove.]

The walls of this hidden chamber are full of jagged protrusions and deep holes. Numerous scorch marks mar the stone in an undecipherable pattern. Whatever formed this alcove, it was unnatural. Rock spires jut down from the ceiling, as if the roof of the space was liquified and slowly cooled. The cave is frigid, save for an arch outlined by fist-sized fire opals on the west most wall. Fiery spouts periodically spew forth from the center of the opals.  A fire opal lined arch and a large landing are here.

This room is illuminated.
You see the 1st white hot magma sentinel, the 2nd white hot magma sentinel, the 1st pair of flame hounds, the 2nd pair of flame hounds, the 3rd pair of flame hounds, and the 4th pair of flame hounds.
In the room are Beauty the Secian (holding a flaming magickal crackling spark), Faliarin the Draco, Draffut the Drake, Raen the Draco, Everest the Noble Secian, Kalessin the Noble Drake, Mieglyn the Secian, Kiki the Secian, Binx the Noble Secian, Ricochet the Secian, Julia the Noble Secian, Rydareon the Drake, Weldoian the Noble Secian (holding a glowing lantern), Gwen the Secian, Mirrdae the Drake, Clara the Secian, Viator the Draco, Nokin the Drake, Verbaniah the Secian, Starlyn the Noble Secian, Mikasi the Drake, Kavita the Noble Secian, Grysmor the Noble Secian, Silran the Secian (holding a glowing hand-painted glass shadow box), Kirrah the Noble Secian, Twilight the Noble Secian, Ying the Drake, Bodhi the Drake, Raptorian the Noble Secian, Feletia the Draco, Linus the Draco, and Helios the Draco.

The walls of this hidden chamber are full of jagged protrusions and deep holes. Numerous scorch marks mar the stone in an undecipherable pattern. Whatever formed this alcove, it was unnatural. Rock spires jut down from the ceiling, as if the roof of the space was liquified and slowly cooled. The cave is frigid, save for an arch outlined by fist-sized fire opals on the west most wall. Fiery spouts periodically spew forth from the center of the opals.  A fire opal lined arch and a large landing are here.

[Private Quarters.]

The dark grey granite walls and ceiling of this room are covered with soot where torches have been allowed to gutter out. Only one torch remains lit next to a stairway leading up. One large, thick-paned window overlooks a walled enclosure below, though the soot on the window prevents any clear view of what is down there. Across from the window, a bookcase filled with scrolls, tomes and jars reaches all the way to the ceiling.  A long worktable holds more scrolls and jars containing assorted specimens.   A tattered flame-embroidered runesilk tapestry, a large black obsidian table, a steaming red glass jar, a sealed clear glass jar, and some dark grey granite stairs are here.

This room is illuminated.
You see the 1st white hot magma sentinel, the 2nd white hot magma sentinel, the 1st pair of flame hounds, the 2nd pair of flame hounds, the 3rd pair of flame hounds, and the 3rd white hot magma sentinel.

[Private Quarters.]

The dark grey granite walls and ceiling of this room are covered with soot where torches have been allowed to gutter out. Only one torch remains lit next to a stairway leading up. One large, thick-paned window overlooks a walled enclosure below, though the soot on the window prevents any clear view of what is down there. Across from the window, a bookcase filled with scrolls, tomes and jars reaches all the way to the ceiling.  A long worktable holds more scrolls and jars containing assorted specimens.   A tattered flame-embroidered runesilk tapestry, a large black obsidian table, a steaming red glass jar, a sealed clear glass jar, and some dark grey granite stairs are here.

This room is illuminated.
In the room are Beauty the Secian (holding a flaming magickal crackling spark), Faliarin the Draco, Draffut the Drake, Raen the Draco, Everest the Noble Secian, Kalessin the Noble Drake, Mieglyn the Secian, Kiki the Secian, Binx the Noble Secian, Ricochet the Secian, Julia the Noble Secian, Rydareon the Drake, Weldoian the Noble Secian (holding a glowing lantern), Gwen the Secian (flying beside you), Mirrdae the Drake, Clara the Secian, Viator the Draco, Nokin the Drake, Verbaniah the Secian, Starlyn the Noble Secian, Mikasi the Drake, Kavita the Noble Secian, Grysmor the Noble Secian, Silran the Secian (holding a glowing hand-painted glass shadow box), Kirrah the Noble Secian, Twilight the Noble Secian, Ying the Drake, Bodhi the Drake, Raptorian the Noble Secian, Feletia the Draco, Linus the Draco, and Helios the Draco.

The dark grey granite walls and ceiling of this room are covered with soot where torches have been allowed to gutter out. Only one torch remains lit next to a stairway leading up. One large, thick-paned window overlooks a walled enclosure below, though the soot on the window prevents any clear view of what is down there. Across from the window, a bookcase filled with scrolls, tomes and jars reaches all the way to the ceiling.  A long worktable holds more scrolls and jars containing assorted specimens.   A tattered flame-embroidered runesilk tapestry, a large black obsidian table, a steaming red glass jar, a sealed clear glass jar, and some dark grey granite stairs are here.

This room is illuminated.
In the room are Beauty the Secian (holding a flaming magickal crackling spark), Faliarin the Draco, Draffut the Drake, Raen the Draco, Everest the Noble Secian, Kalessin the Noble Drake, Mieglyn the Secian, Kiki the Secian, Binx the Noble Secian, Ricochet the Secian, Julia the Noble Secian, Rydareon the Drake, Weldoian the Noble Secian (holding a glowing lantern), Gwen the Secian (flying beside you), Mirrdae the Drake, Clara the Secian, Viator the Draco, Nokin the Drake, Verbaniah the Secian, Starlyn the Noble Secian, Mikasi the Drake, Kavita the Noble Secian, Grysmor the Noble Secian, Silran the Secian (holding a glowing hand-painted glass shadow box), Kirrah the Noble Secian, Twilight the Noble Secian, Ying the Drake, Bodhi the Drake, Raptorian the Noble Secian, Feletia the Draco, Linus the Draco, and Helios the Draco.

A narrow bed shoved against one wall is the only indication that this room might be anything other than a library dedicated to the study of magick and the races of dragon and wyvern. A tall set of shelves along one wall holds specimens and scrolls, and the large desk beneath the single window is covered with parchments and maps. Amidst the papers on the desk lie a few dark ovoid shapes, one that glistens wetly and could be the source of a low background humming noise. The back wall is lined with a row of hooks, from which hangs a the body of a young wyvern, possibly dead.  The head is marked with still glowing runes that have been burnt or carved into the scales.   Some dark grey granite stairs and a rune-inscribed gleaming obsidian archway are here.

[Small Laboratory.]

A single long stone table fills the center of the room, covered in vials, beakers and an assortment of unusual equipment. The smell in the room is a mix of sulfur, blood and a burning acidic reek. Small orbs of magefire hang in midair above the table, pulsing with an eldritch light. A locked crystalla fronted cupboard stands against one wall, filled with carefully labeled jars. Atop the cupboard is a small cage filled with glowing red-eyed rodents.   A tiny petrified wyvernbone skeleton, a small dark wooden rack of vials, a putrid yellow glass vial, a steaming chartreuse glass vial, a blood filled glass vial, an open short long shadowglass chest, an open hand carved duskwood trunk, a rune-inscribed gleaming obsidian archway, and a closed large blackened duskwood trapdoor are here.

[Underground Courtyard.]

An uneasy silence fills this crescent shaped courtyard. Surrounding you are walls of smooth, dull grey stone carved out of the very foundation rock of the Keep somewhere far above you. Although empty and seemingly uninhabited, the courtyard shows signs of maintenance; the hewn stone floors and walls meticulously dust, dirt and cobweb free. Dozens of smokeless oil lamps suspended from wrought iron poles embedded deep into the stone of the floor cast overlapping spheres of light that illuminate the entire courtyard brightly. Any sound made echoes faintly off the impossibly tall walls that create the inner curve of the crescent. The top of the inner wall is not visible, the grey of their stone fading into the grey of the indistinguishable ceiling. To the west, a tower-top is visible in the dim light of the upper regions of this peculiar fortress. At the western corner of the crescent is a doorway sealed with a thick, bloodsteel hinged steelwood door.   A giant sigil etched bloodsteel portcullis and a closed bloodsteel hinged steelwood door are here.

This room is illuminated.

[Underground Courtyard.]

An uneasy silence fills this crescent shaped courtyard. Surrounding you are walls of smooth, dull grey stone carved out of the very foundation rock of the Keep somewhere far above you. Although empty and seemingly uninhabited, the courtyard shows signs of maintenance; the hewn stone floors and walls meticulously dust, dirt and cobweb free. Dozens of smokeless oil lamps suspended from wrought iron poles embedded deep into the stone of the floor cast overlapping spheres of light that illuminate the entire courtyard brightly. Any sound made echoes faintly off the impossibly tall walls that create the inner curve of the crescent. The top of the inner wall is not visible, the grey of their stone fading into the grey of the indistinguishable ceiling. To the west, a tower-top is visible in the dim light of the upper regions of this peculiar fortress. At the western corner of the crescent is a doorway sealed with a thick, bloodsteel hinged steelwood door.   A giant sigil etched bloodsteel portcullis and an open bloodsteel hinged steelwood door are here.

This room is illuminated.
In the room are Beauty the Secian (holding a flaming magickal crackling spark), Faliarin the Draco, Draffut the Drake, Raen the Draco, Everest the Noble Secian, Kalessin the Noble Drake, Mieglyn the Secian, Kiki the Secian, Binx the Noble Secian, Ricochet the Secian, Julia the Noble Secian (flying 10 feet above ground), Rydareon the Drake, Weldoian the Noble Secian (holding a glowing lantern), Gwen the Secian, Mirrdae the Drake, Clara the Secian, Viator the Draco, Nokin the Drake, Verbaniah the Secian, Starlyn the Noble Secian, Mikasi the Drake, Kavita the Noble Secian, Grysmor the Noble Secian, Silran the Secian (holding a glowing hand-painted glass shadow box), Kirrah the Noble Secian, Twilight the Noble Secian, Ying the Drake, Bodhi the Drake, Raptorian the Noble Secian, Feletia the Draco, Linus the Draco, and Helios the Draco.

A shining Saldean silver spear rack, a shining Saldean silver spear rack, an open bluesteel reinforced duskwood door, and a giant sigil etched bloodsteel portcullis are here.

Empty except for a few sparse furnishings, the tower room's focus is a wide window that looks down into three wedge-shaped cells that form the inner circle of the fortress. Although possible to see all three cells, the contents of one cell in particular is fully viewable whereas the other two cells are only partially visible. From so high above, the walls do not look as impossibly tall as they appeared from the ground. More oil lamps illuminate the ceilingless room, explaining the ability to see its upper crenellations from the courtyard. Two chairs and a writing podium stand near the center of the window.  One on each side of the room, two staircases lead to different parts of the lower level, one spiraling back down to the entrance courtyard and the other into the main portion of the fortress.  A steep staircase, a steep staircase, and an open heavy reinforced duskwood door are here.

A large black marble table dominates most of the floor space of this busy room. The air is bone numbing in its chilliness. Wrought iron shelves, bolted to the walls with orichalcum pins, line the perimeter of the room. The walls themselves are hidden from you due to the shelves being so overstocked. The western wall houses sealed jars, beakers, stoppered vials, bottles, and topped flasks. The eastern walls shelves are lined with specimens of birds, lizards, snakes, and creatures somewhere in between. Most of the creatures are preserved in fluid or dried, though a good many of the smaller ones are alive and housed in cages or giant mesh-lidded glass jars. Shrieks issue from one particular cage drawing your attention to a enraged, winged creature with both reptilian and avian characteristics.  An open heavy reinforced duskwood door is here.

The southern wall boasts perfectly shrunken skeletons of many different species. Many of the skeletons are from easily recognizable animals. Most of the articulated figures reflect a collector with draconic interests. There are skeletons each of the four stages of dragons, a drag-al skeleton, a wyvern skeleton, and some type of winged serpent creature. Each has been seemingly scaled down to three to four foot size. The wall to the north is lined with similar, shrunken specimens in various stages of dissection. The torso of a drag-al lays spread open, ribs broken and pulled back so the internal organs can be viewed. A long arm with structure resembling an older dragon lays here with the skin flayed off the lower arm, revealing the musculature above the radius and ulna. The fingers have been stripped entirely of their skin, muscle, and flesh, detailing the bone structure of the fingers and claws.

Empty except for a few sparse furnishings, the tower room's focus is a wide window that looks down into three wedge-shaped cells that form the inner circle of the fortress. Although possible to see all three cells, the contents of one cell in particular is fully viewable whereas the other two cells are only partially visible. From so high above, the walls do not look as impossibly tall as they appeared from the ground. More oil lamps illuminate the ceilingless room, explaining the ability to see its upper crenellations from the courtyard. Two chairs and a writing podium stand near the center of the window.  One on each side of the room, two staircases lead to different parts of the lower level, one spiraling back down to the entrance courtyard and the other into the main portion of the fortress.  A steep staircase, a steep staircase, and an open heavy reinforced duskwood door are here.

Empty except for a few sparse furnishings, the tower room's focus is a wide window that looks down into three wedge-shaped cells that form the inner circle of the fortress. Although possible to see all three cells, the contents of one cell in particular is fully viewable whereas the other two cells are only partially visible. From so high above, the walls do not look as impossibly tall as they appeared from the ground. More oil lamps illuminate the ceilingless room, explaining the ability to see its upper crenellations from the courtyard. Two chairs and a writing podium stand near the center of the window.  One on each side of the room, two staircases lead to different parts of the lower level, one spiraling back down to the entrance courtyard and the other into the main portion of the fortress.  A steep staircase, a steep staircase, and an open heavy reinforced duskwood door are here.

[Cell.]

While the other areas of this underground area have been neatly kept, this pen is a mess. Dirty straw stands three feet deep throughout the wedge-shaped confinement. The red-brown stain of dried blood pairs with its metallic tangy scent to demonstrate the pen has been used for ill will. The grey stone walls are scorched black along much of the perimeter. Two long starsteel rods run the span of the pen about fifeteen feet off the ground. Cracked and yellowing bones are mixed within the straw bedding.  A huge bloodsteel gated archway is here.

This room is illuminated.

While the other areas of this underground area have been neatly kept, this pen is a mess. Dirty straw stands three feet deep throughout the wedge-shaped confinement. The red-brown stain of dried blood pairs with its metallic tangy scent to demonstrate the pen has been used for ill will. The grey stone walls are scorched black along much of the perimeter. Two long starsteel rods run the span of the pen about fifeteen feet off the ground. Cracked and yellowing bones are mixed within the straw bedding.

[Crescent-Shaped Hall.]

A long hallway curves around gradually to the east. The outer walls are cool to the touch and are part of the living rock that has been carved away to make this underground keep. The inner walls, although carved of the same rock, are freestanding in spite of the fact that their vertical culmination is lost in the gloom of the upper atmosphere of this giant, man-made cavern. Set several paces apart into the inner wall are three huge bloodsteel gated archways. Iron sconces embedded in the outer walls dangle small, smokeless oil lamps that illuminate the hall brightly.  A steep staircase, a huge bloodsteel gated archway, a huge bloodsteel gated archway, and a huge bloodsteel gated archway are here.

Empty except for a few sparse furnishings, the tower room's focus is a wide window that looks down into three wedge-shaped cells that form the inner circle of the fortress. Although possible to see all three cells, the contents of one cell in particular is fully viewable whereas the other two cells are only partially visible. From so high above, the walls do not look as impossibly tall as they appeared from the ground. More oil lamps illuminate the ceilingless room, explaining the ability to see its upper crenellations from the courtyard. Two chairs and a writing podium stand near the center of the window.  One on each side of the room, two staircases lead to different parts of the lower level, one spiraling back down to the entrance courtyard and the other into the main portion of the fortress.

A large black marble table dominates most of the floor space of this busy room. The air is bone numbing in its chilliness. Wrought iron shelves, bolted to the walls with orichalcum pins, line the perimeter of the room. The walls themselves are hidden from you due to the shelves being so overstocked. The western wall houses sealed jars, beakers, stoppered vials, bottles, and topped flasks. The eastern walls shelves are lined with specimens of birds, lizards, snakes, and creatures somewhere in between. Most of the creatures are preserved in fluid or dried, though a good many of the smaller ones are alive and housed in cages or giant mesh-lidded glass jars. Shrieks issue from one particular cage drawing your attention to a enraged, winged creature with both reptilian and avian characteristics.  An open heavy reinforced duskwood door is here.

An uneasy silence fills this crescent shaped courtyard. Surrounding you are walls of smooth, dull grey stone carved out of the very foundation rock of the Keep somewhere far above you. Although empty and seemingly uninhabited, the courtyard shows signs of maintenance; the hewn stone floors and walls meticulously dust, dirt and cobweb free. Dozens of smokeless oil lamps suspended from wrought iron poles embedded deep into the stone of the floor cast overlapping spheres of light that illuminate the entire courtyard brightly. Any sound made echoes faintly off the impossibly tall walls that create the inner curve of the crescent. The top of the inner wall is not visible, the grey of their stone fading into the grey of the indistinguishable ceiling. To the west, a tower-top is visible in the dim light of the upper regions of this peculiar fortress. At the western corner of the crescent is a doorway sealed with a thick, bloodsteel hinged steelwood door.   A giant sigil etched bloodsteel portcullis and an open bloodsteel hinged steelwood door are here.

A feat of masonry genius, a staircase of giant, grey stone blocks spirals around and around the walls of the tower from the small entryway at the bottom of the tower all the way to  a narrow platform at the top of the tower where an archway leads into a room. Looking up or down from any point through the center of the staircase gives you a clear view of the dizzying drop awaiting someone careless enough to get too close to the unguarded outer edge of the stairs.  A steep stairway leading up and an open bloodsteel hinged steelwood door are here.

Empty except for a few sparse furnishings, the tower room's focus is a wide window that looks down into three wedge-shaped cells that form the inner circle of the fortress. Although possible to see all three cells, the contents of one cell in particular is fully viewable whereas the other two cells are only partially visible. From so high above, the walls do not look as impossibly tall as they appeared from the ground. More oil lamps illuminate the ceilingless room, explaining the ability to see its upper crenellations from the courtyard. Two chairs and a writing podium stand near the center of the window.  One on each side of the room, two staircases lead to different parts of the lower level, one spiraling back down to the entrance courtyard and the other into the main portion of the fortress.  A steep staircase, a steep staircase, and an open heavy reinforced duskwood door are here.

A device cracks with green energy upon the far wall. Seemingly a rectangular metal box, the upper surface has nine square holes cut into it. Exactly nine cubic pieces are arranged in a straight line along the upper edge of the box. Each cube as a number on it, ranging from one to nine. A diagram is sketched on a piece of parchment next to the device.   A detailed parchment diagram is here.

Empty except for a few sparse furnishings, the tower room's focus is a wide window that looks down into three wedge-shaped cells that form the inner circle of the fortress. Although possible to see all three cells, the contents of one cell in particular is fully viewable whereas the other two cells are only partially visible. From so high above, the walls do not look as impossibly tall as they appeared from the ground. More oil lamps illuminate the ceilingless room, explaining the ability to see its upper crenellations from the courtyard. Two chairs and a writing podium stand near the center of the window.  One on each side of the room, two staircases lead to different parts of the lower level, one spiraling back down to the entrance courtyard and the other into the main portion of the fortress.  A steep staircase, a steep staircase, and an open heavy reinforced duskwood door are here.

A stale scent hangs in the air within this cell. Stains, blood and some indistinguishable, on the floor and the musty pile of straw littered with small animal bones in the back corner leave the source of the scent to your imagination. Heavy bloodsteel leg and arm restraints are embedded into one of the walls. Dusty but still in good repair, the manacles dangle from their chains awaiting use. Shallow claw marks score the walls around the arm restrains and on the floor directly below.  A huge bloodsteel gated archway is here.

A steep staircase, a huge bloodsteel gated archway, a huge bloodsteel gated archway, and a huge bloodsteel gated archway are here.

While the other areas of this underground area have been neatly kept, this pen is a mess. Dirty straw stands three feet deep throughout the wedge-shaped confinement. The red-brown stain of dried blood pairs with its metallic tangy scent to demonstrate the pen has been used for ill will. The grey stone walls are scorched black along much of the perimeter. Two long starsteel rods run the span of the pen about fifeteen feet off the ground. Cracked and yellowing bones are mixed within the straw bedding.

While the other areas of this underground area have been neatly kept, this pen is a mess. Dirty straw stands three feet deep throughout the wedge-shaped confinement. The red-brown stain of dried blood pairs with its metallic tangy scent to demonstrate the pen has been used for ill will. The grey stone walls are scorched black along much of the perimeter. Two long starsteel rods run the span of the pen about fifeteen feet off the ground. Cracked and yellowing bones are mixed within the straw bedding.  A huge bloodsteel gated archway, a pale green glass bottle, and an open intricately woven reed bread basket are here.

While the other areas of this underground area have been neatly kept, this pen is a mess. Dirty straw stands three feet deep throughout the wedge-shaped confinement. The red-brown stain of dried blood pairs with its metallic tangy scent to demonstrate the pen has been used for ill will. The grey stone walls are scorched black along much of the perimeter. Two long starsteel rods run the span of the pen about fifeteen feet off the ground. Cracked and yellowing bones are mixed within the straw bedding.  A huge bloodsteel gated archway, a pale green glass bottle, and an open intricately woven reed bread basket are here.

From so high above, the walls do not look as impossibly tall as they appeared from the ground. More oil lamps illuminate the ceilingless room, explaining the ability to see its upper crenellations from the courtyard. Two chairs and a writing podium stand near the center of the window.  One on each side of the room, two staircases lead to different parts of the lower level, one spiraling back down to the entrance courtyard and the other into the main portion of the fortress.

A long hallway curves around gradually to the east. The outer walls are cool to the touch and are part of the living rock that has been carved away to make this underground keep. The inner walls, although carved of the same rock, are freestanding in spite of the fact that their vertical culmination is lost in the gloom of the upper atmosphere of this giant, man-made cavern. Set several paces apart into the inner wall are three huge bloodsteel gated archways. Iron sconces embedded in the outer walls dangle small, smokeless oil lamps that illuminate the hall brightly.  A steep staircase, a huge bloodsteel gated archway, a huge bloodsteel gated archway, and a huge bloodsteel gated archway are here.

[Underground Courtyard.]

An uneasy silence fills this crescent shaped courtyard. Surrounding you are walls of smooth, dull grey stone carved out of the very foundation rock of the Keep somewhere far above you. Although empty and seemingly uninhabited, the courtyard shows signs of maintenance; the hewn stone floors and walls meticulously dust, dirt and cobweb free. Dozens of smokeless oil lamps suspended from wrought iron poles embedded deep into the stone of the floor cast overlapping spheres of light that illuminate the entire courtyard brightly. Any sound made echoes faintly off the impossibly tall walls that create the inner curve of the crescent. The top of the inner wall is not visible, the grey of their stone fading into the grey of the indistinguishable ceiling. To the west, a tower-top is visible in the dim light of the upper regions of this peculiar fortress. At the western corner of the crescent is a doorway sealed with a thick, bloodsteel hinged steelwood door.   A giant sigil etched bloodsteel portcullis and an open bloodsteel hinged steelwood door are here.

[Underground Courtyard.]

An uneasy silence fills this crescent shaped courtyard. Surrounding you are walls of smooth, dull grey stone carved out of the very foundation rock of the Keep somewhere far above you. Although empty and seemingly uninhabited, the courtyard shows signs of maintenance; the hewn stone floors and walls meticulously dust, dirt and cobweb free. Dozens of smokeless oil lamps suspended from wrought iron poles embedded deep into the stone of the floor cast overlapping spheres of light that illuminate the entire courtyard brightly. Any sound made echoes faintly off the impossibly tall walls that create the inner curve of the crescent. The top of the inner wall is not visible, the grey of their stone fading into the grey of the indistinguishable ceiling. To the west, a tower-top is visible in the dim light of the upper regions of this peculiar fortress. At the western corner of the crescent is a doorway sealed with a thick, bloodsteel hinged steelwood door.   A giant sigil etched bloodsteel portcullis and an open bloodsteel hinged steelwood door are here.

This room is illuminated.
You see the 1st spaglen tier.

An uneasy silence fills this crescent shaped courtyard. Surrounding you are walls of smooth, dull grey stone carved out of the very foundation rock of the Keep somewhere far above you. Although empty and seemingly uninhabited, the courtyard shows signs of maintenance; the hewn stone floors and walls meticulously dust, dirt and cobweb free. Dozens of smokeless oil lamps suspended from wrought iron poles embedded deep into the stone of the floor cast overlapping spheres of light that illuminate the entire courtyard brightly. Any sound made echoes faintly off the impossibly tall walls that create the inner curve of the crescent. The top of the inner wall is not visible, the grey of their stone fading into the grey of the indistinguishable ceiling. To the west, a tower-top is visible in the dim light of the upper regions of this peculiar fortress. At the western corner of the crescent is a doorway sealed with a thick, bloodsteel hinged steelwood door.   A giant sigil etched bloodsteel portcullis and an open bloodsteel hinged steelwood door are here.

A grate covers the spanse of floor leading from a heavily reinforced door to a steep, winding spiral staircase. Due to the damp conditions and dripping water, the bluesteel grate underfoot has long since lost its luster. A harsh wind blows upward through the grate, swirls around in the landing, and streams up the staircase. An eerie cacophony of moans and howls accompany the wind.  Some winding steps leading upward and an open bluesteel reinforced duskwood door are here.

A single long stone table fills the center of the room, covered in vials, beakers and an assortment of unusual equipment. The smell in the room is a mix of sulfur, blood and a burning acidic reek. Small orbs of magefire hang in midair above the table, pulsing with an eldritch light. A locked crystalla fronted cupboard stands against one wall, filled with carefully labeled jars. Atop the cupboard is a small cage filled with glowing red-eyed rodents.   A tiny petrified wyvernbone skeleton, a small dark wooden rack of vials, a putrid yellow glass vial, a steaming chartreuse glass vial, a blood filled glass vial, an open short long shadowglass chest, an open hand carved duskwood trunk, a rune-inscribed gleaming obsidian archway, and an open large blackened duskwood trapdoor are here.

A single long stone table fills the center of the room, covered in vials, beakers and an assortment of unusual equipment. The smell in the room is a mix of sulfur, blood and a burning acidic reek. Small orbs of magefire hang in midair above the table, pulsing with an eldritch light. A locked crystalla fronted cupboard stands against one wall, filled with carefully labeled jars. Atop the cupboard is a small cage filled with glowing red-eyed rodents.   A tiny petrified wyvernbone skeleton, a small dark wooden rack of vials, a putrid yellow glass vial, a steaming chartreuse glass vial, a blood filled glass vial, an open short long shadowglass chest, an open hand carved duskwood trunk, a rune-inscribed gleaming obsidian archway, and an open large blackened duskwood trapdoor are here.

[Private Quarters.]

A narrow bed shoved against one wall is the only indication that this room might be anything other than a library dedicated to the study of magick and the races of dragon and wyvern. A tall set of shelves along one wall holds specimens and scrolls, and the large desk beneath the single window is covered with parchments and maps. Amidst the papers on the desk lie a few dark ovoid shapes, one that glistens wetly and could be the source of a low background humming noise. The back wall is lined with a row of hooks, from which hangs a the body of a young wyvern, possibly dead.  The head is marked with still glowing runes that have been burnt or carved into the scales.   Some dark grey granite stairs and a rune-inscribed gleaming obsidian archway are here.

A narrow bed shoved against one wall is the only indication that this room might be anything other than a library dedicated to the study of magick and the races of dragon and wyvern. A tall set of shelves along one wall holds specimens and scrolls, and the large desk beneath the single window is covered with parchments and maps. Amidst the papers on the desk lie a few dark ovoid shapes, one that glistens wetly and could be the source of a low background humming noise. The back wall is lined with a row of hooks, from which hangs a the body of a young wyvern, possibly dead.  The head is marked with still glowing runes that have been burnt or carved into the scales.   Some dark grey granite stairs and a rune-inscribed gleaming obsidian archway are here.

This room is illuminated.
In the room are Mieglyn the Secian (holding a glowing hand-painted glass shadow box), Beauty the Secian (holding a flaming magickal crackling spark), Faliarin the Draco, Raen the Draco, Everest the Noble Secian (flying 5 feet above you and holding a glowing horn lantern), Starlyn the Noble Secian, Kiki the Secian, Binx the Noble Secian (holding a glowing mysterious wand of light), Ricochet the Secian, Julia the Noble Secian (holding a glowing swirling multicolored globe), Draffut the Drake, Weldoian the Noble Secian (holding a glowing lantern), Gwen the Secian, Mirrdae the Drake, Clara the Secian, Nokin the Drake (flying beside you), Verbaniah the Secian (holding a glowing delicate red crystal rose), Mikasi the Drake, Kavita the Noble Secian, Silran the Secian (holding a glowing hand-painted glass shadow box), Kirrah the Noble Secian, Twilight the Noble Secian (holding a flaming massive dark blue wax candle), Bodhi the Drake's lifeless body, Raptorian the Noble Secian, Feletia the Draco, Linus the Draco, and Helios the Draco.

The dark grey granite walls and ceiling of this room are covered with soot where torches have been allowed to gutter out. Only one torch remains lit next to a stairway leading up. One large, thick-paned window overlooks a walled enclosure below, though the soot on the window prevents any clear view of what is down there. Across from the window, a bookcase filled with scrolls, tomes and jars reaches all the way to the ceiling.  A long worktable holds more scrolls and jars containing assorted specimens.   A tattered flame-embroidered runesilk tapestry, a large black obsidian table, a steaming red glass jar, a sealed clear glass jar, and some dark grey granite stairs are here.

This room is illuminated.
In the room are Mieglyn the Secian (holding a glowing hand-painted glass shadow box), Beauty the Secian (holding a flaming magickal crackling spark), Faliarin the Draco, Raen the Draco, Everest the Noble Secian (flying 5 feet above you and holding a glowing horn lantern), Starlyn the Noble Secian, Kalessin the Noble Drake's lifeless body, Kiki the Secian, Binx the Noble Secian (holding a glowing mysterious wand of light), Ying the Drake's lifeless body, Ricochet the Secian, Julia the Noble Secian (holding a glowing swirling multicolored globe), Rydareon the Drake, Draffut the Drake, Weldoian the Noble Secian (holding a glowing lantern), Gwen the Secian (flying beside you), Mirrdae the Drake, Clara the Secian, Nokin the Drake (flying beside you), Verbaniah the Secian (holding a glowing delicate red crystal rose), Mikasi the Drake, Kavita the Noble Secian, Silran the Secian (holding a glowing hand-painted glass shadow box), Kirrah the Noble Secian, Twilight the Noble Secian (holding a flaming massive dark blue wax candle), Bodhi the Drake's lifeless body, Raptorian the Noble Secian, Feletia the Draco, Linus the Draco, and Helios the Draco.

The dark grey granite walls and ceiling of this room are covered with soot where torches have been allowed to gutter out. Only one torch remains lit next to a stairway leading up. One large, thick-paned window overlooks a walled enclosure below, though the soot on the window prevents any clear view of what is down there. Across from the window, a bookcase filled with scrolls, tomes and jars reaches all the way to the ceiling.  A long worktable holds more scrolls and jars containing assorted specimens.   A tattered flame-embroidered runesilk tapestry, a large black obsidian table, a steaming red glass jar, a sealed clear glass jar, and some dark grey granite stairs are here.

This room is illuminated.
In the room are Mieglyn the Secian (holding a glowing hand-painted glass shadow box), Beauty the Secian (holding a flaming magickal crackling spark), Faliarin the Draco, Raen the Draco, Everest the Noble Secian (flying 5 feet above you and holding a glowing horn lantern), Grysmor the Noble Secian (holding a glowing finely woven silver mesh cage of fireflies), Starlyn the Noble Secian, Kalessin the Noble Drake's lifeless body, Kiki the Secian, Binx the Noble Secian (holding a glowing mysterious wand of light), Ricochet the Secian, Julia the Noble Secian (holding a glowing swirling multicolored globe), Rydareon the Drake, Weldoian the Noble Secian (holding a glowing lantern), Gwen the Secian (flying beside you), Mirrdae the Drake, Clara the Secian, Nokin the Drake, Verbaniah the Secian (holding a glowing delicate red crystal rose), Mikasi the Drake, Kavita the Noble Secian, Silran the Secian (holding a glowing hand-painted glass shadow box), Kirrah the Noble Secian, Twilight the Noble Secian (holding a flaming massive dark blue wax candle), Raptorian the Noble Secian, Feletia the Draco, Linus the Draco, and Helios the Draco.

                        You have visualized the following locations
                        -------------------------------------------

                                    Visualization #1 is:
The towering trees of the forest begin their ascension of the large mountain seen from the open plains of New South Lake. The root holds are precarious, as the mountain's face is especially steep on the northern side. The muddy path concludes in front of a sheer stone wall covered with verdant patches of green moss. A numbing breeze blows outward from the depths a massive cavern mouth, as if the mountain itself was exhaling ice-chilled breath. Deep-cut symbols grace the sides of the cavern entrance. They appear to be recently completed, as time, water, and weather have not yet dulled the sharp lines of the cuts.

                                    Visualization #2 is:
At the top of the steep hill, the magnificent landscape of the Silver Mountain stretches all around Crystal Snowflake Village, cradling the holiday town at its base. The path makes a sharp turn upwards along a stream, filled with icy chunks and flickering silver and gold fish. A few courageous Hithuals stand along the riverbank as they prepare to go ice diving.

                                    Visualization #3 is:
An abundant gallery of paintings depicting sacrifices and hold offerings to their god suspend from crooked iron nails. Resting beside each painting, cold black iron braziers appear to hold burned blood and bone. A few charred, blackened pieces can be found in them. Several iron chains hang along the walls of the sacrificial chamber. Along the floor, intricately placed colored slate tiles are coated in dust covered dried blood. Centering the room is a raised platform accessible through a flight of stairs. Upon this raised formation rests an altar inlaid with rows and rows of teeth.

[Forest path.]

A wide, shallow sheet of water forms as two shallow streams join in the gully that accompanies the forest path. A kingfisher watches the shallows with hungered interest; several dragonflies skim the water, while water striders skate along the its surface. The soaring oak, ash, and pine trees do a fair, but not complete, job of blocking the jutting mountain to the south.

The shall stream that serves as the trail's guide is lazy, taking its time. The water murmurs softly to itself as it stumbles over mossy stones and slides beneath large sentinel oaks and pines. The season's leaves decorate the stream's ripples, their greens and browns dappled with shadow and the bit of light allowed to pass through the canopy.

[Forest path.]

The forest path follows a muddy gully eroded by a shallow stream. Tall pine and oak trees tower above both sides of the muddy banks. Large mossy stones force the stream to twist and turn as it flows slowly south. The ground seems to be sloping downward slightly as the stream cuts back to the southeast.

A fallen tree blocks the path, but it is easily circumvented. On the south side lies a small gully and stream flowing east to southwest. It is hard to tell if the path follows the stream or heads back into the trees.  Some glowing enchanted twinkling diamond candles are here.

[Forest path.]

The forest path requires constant twisting and turning to navigate undeterred through the obstacle course of fallen trunks, thick spider webs, and lush fern and ivy growth. Though not obvious at first glance, a game trail does indeed snake its way through the rotting leaves and pine needles that make up the padded forest floor. A bright red cardinal, frightened by your sudden presence, takes wing and quickly vanishes, consumed by thick greenery all around.  Some glowing enchanted twinkling diamond candles are here.

[Forest path.]

An ever-present breeze rustles the leaves of the old, ominous oak trees that the forest path meanders through. A few tall pine trees are sprinkled throughout the expanse of oaks, contributing their needles and cones to the ocassional forest shower of wind dislodged debris. The path continues into the forest to the south, its serpentine nature lending to the ancient forest a means to disguise the final destination.  A path and some glowing enchanted twinkling diamond candles are here.

The open plains stretch out endlessly to the north of you.  Gentle breezes cause the sea of grass to ripple and roll like the ocean deep.  A tall, solid mass of trees blocks any attempt to travel south.  A river has cut off travel to the east.  A lake, a path, and a muddy trail are here.

With Meetpoint at your heels this rugged old cobblestone bridge leads to the Southern Plains and the main trade routes from spur and Meetpoint to the Southernmost reaches of the lands. Signs that this road was once well traveled by the hustle and bustle of laden carts are plain to view.

A few guards do a roving patrol of the area and down to the bridge. They check the caravans before they enter and anyone that looks suspicious they throw into the river. They seem quite wary of anyone coming or going to and from the city. From their appearance it would seem best to stay on their good sides and hope that they are in good moods.  An open large sturdy wooden gate, a stone bridge, and a floating pontoon bridge are here.

Here a gate leads out of the fort and into the Southern regions. Several children run and play just inside the gate, under the watchful eyes of the guards. What was once a very well used trade route has slowed to some caravans bringing supplies for the townsmen and the occasional merchants traveling from the far southern reaches of the land. Many guards protect this section of the fort as it is home to some wild beasts that live outside these walls. In the distance, you can make out two more guards hunting the frogmen that often try to attack the city and caravans.  An open large sturdy wooden gate and a glowing wrought iron lantern are here.

Through the slates of the wooden walkways, you can make out four archers playing a game of cards, weapons at the ready. A whip cracks loudly as a caravan heads out the gate towards Spur.

The grass rises taller and taller in every direction further limiting view just off the roadside. A second glance reveals that this is the lowest point in a large, shallow depression. The tradeway sinks a little lower as it gets closer to the river off to the west. A ditch runs alongside the river's side of the road, small puddles of water filling the bottom. Trickles filter into the puddles from the grass beyond as mosquitoes dart across the muddy surfaces.

Set in the marble base is a small plaque that reads, "For those who have gone before us." Many stand for a moment as they pass this way, giving thanks for the gift of life that is given by both the apple tree and the Secians of long ago. Large piles of dirt and broken stone lay on either side of the street as workmen ready the east and west alleys for expansion.  A street lantern, an open Secian etched moonsilver door, a pair of closed silver forged swinging doors, and a sign above the doors are here.

[Southern Avenue.]

Vast estates tower over the huge Spurian wall towards the south. The well-to-do who live in these homes idle away their days, enjoying the luxury of time. Standing next to a very empty lantern pole, a small Flerian child insists in a plaintive wail, that he had nothing to do with the missing lantern. The well-dressed guard that interrogates him keeps pointing at a small sack on the ground and its obvious contents.  An open small burlap sack, a street lantern, and a lantern are here.

Southern Avenue leads between the center of Spur and the homes of the prosperous and wealthy. Several of the Ladies of the city stroll along the avenue chatting about the current events and latest gossip of the Spur. Behind them, harried servants carry their reticules and all those belongings that they cannot be without.  A street lantern is here.

Smooth stones make up the street that leads from the center of Spur to the south. Each stone has been carefully fitted for the most comfortable travel by both cart and traveler alike. A well dressed Guard patrols the area in his dress uniform. Captains don't allow for slovenly appearances on this patrol.  A street lantern and a closed ruby-studded dragon-etched steel door are here.

[Town Square South.]

The outward appearance of the people here seems a bit classier. Rich clothing and large coin purses are prevalent amongst the travelers. In fact, many of the folk heading into Town Square from the south are accompanied by large bodyguards to assure their safety. The well maintained road is lined with small brass lanterns, each swinging off an individual pole. No expense has been spared to keep those who travel this road safe from the hoodlums that relish the darkness.  A street lantern is here.

[Town Square Center.]

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.   A flowing white marble fountain, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a marble statue of a Human, a rosewood sign, a white snow drift, and a highly polished marble statue of a Dragon are here.

Commercial buildings flank Town Square to the west and south of this corner. Imposing buildings stand stiffly to your west, while those to the south have a slightly seedy look about them.

Before you stands a magnificent white marble temple dedicated to Odarous, the god of chivalry. Ten giant steps made of the same gleaming marble lead up to the temple entrance. Two large statues stand at the base of the stairs, also carved of breath-taking marble. One is a warrior bearing a massive sword and a large shield. The other is a cleric with an amulet bearing the mark of Odarous in one hand and a large mace in the other.  Some gleaming white marble stairs, a polished white marble statue, a polished white marble statue, and a street lantern are here.

Knowledge Path heads out of the bustling Town Square and moves southwest towards the District of Magick and Rehas Way. Mixed with the robed mages that move southwest are merchants, customers and thieves alike. Moving quickly, especially with a full purse, is your best bet along this path.  A street lantern is here.

Several members of the various mage orders of Spur and well-dressed shoppers seeking rarities travel along Knowledge's Path to and from the District of Magick. The district is the place to find the most talented artisans and craftiest merchants in Spur. It is also home to the mages of the non-elemental order.  A street lantern is here.

A heated discussion breaks out briefly between members of opposing orders of magick. The presence of the city guard rapidly brings an end to the exchange before the verbal debate over power and skill turns into a demonstration.  A street lantern is here.

Knowledge Path terminates here at the gateway to the Magick District. In respect to the demands of the various religious and guild leaders, magick is kept as far from them as possible. A city plagued by rioting mage haters is the last thing Spur needs.  A street lantern is here.

A massive circular stone platform stands to the side of Magick Lane, strangely entrancing runes carved on every inch of its sides. The symbol of the god Sa, a golden Dragon, fills the space along the top. Raw power and magick seem to flow from the platform, making the air around it crackle with energy. A small sign stands next to the platform with a single word written upon it.  A rune covered platform, a floating blue ruby staircase leading down, and a street lantern are here.

A low slung building resides on the west side of the street. Chanting can be heard from within.  Occasionally a few sparks rise into the sky, or some unwarranted raindrops begin, but they quickly are quelled. A large pair of wooden doors, their surface carved with rune symbols grace the entrance.  A street lantern and some open rune-etched wooden doors are here.

A squat ugly little shack stands somber on the eastern side of this well swept lane. The occasional high pitched cackle sounds out from the shack, garnering strange looks from all who pass by. A mysterious gothic structure rises up on the opposite side of the street, the occasional explosion thundering out from within its doors, followed by muffled curses and breaking glass.  An open thick iron door, an open ugly rotting door, a rotting oak sign, and a street lantern are here.

A small sign hangs from above the door of the well-kept store before you, telling you that it is a rune shop. The occasional bright flash of light from inside the store suggests all kinds of strange and rare magicks are being cast inside! Those who walk past you glance at the rune shop warily and hurry to get past it as quickly as possible. A small sign hangs from the doorknob of the store that reads "Flerians not allowed!"  An intricately carved oak door and a street lantern are here.

Incredible images cover every free corner of this small store, pictures of every possible rune available for purchase hang from the ceiling, on the walls and some even sit on the floor. Drawn onto scrolls, carved into the wood finish of the building or crafted from any number of other materials, each of the different runes has its own strange feeling of excitement to it. The shop owner looks to know what every one of the runes does.  A large glowing sign, a wooden sign, an intricately carved oak door, and some flaming ruby ashes are here.
