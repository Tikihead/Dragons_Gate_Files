The well worn walk-way opens up to the burial chamber. Tree roots have penetrated the cave's ceiling and hang down like spider webs to ensnare anything that passes too close.

A low point for the entire burial chamber, this part of the cave serves as a sort of garbage pit. The tear-bringing stench is amplified in the musty, closed confines of this chamber. Bits and pieces of unidentifiable bodies cover the floor of the pit, mired in a thick mud that reeks worse than any city's affluent. Slight rustling sounds come from the walls as scores of insects wriggle and worm their way into the pit.

The smaller chamber reeks of death. Piles of mud attest to the fact that this excavation is fairly new. A trail of dark, putrefied liquid leads to a half-rotted, half-eaten corpse crumpled against the wall. Bones lay scattered about, some crushed and some split. There is no sign of what was consuming the corpse. Grooves in the mud lead to the east.  A burnt offering is here.

The path abruptly ends at the trap door of an underground burial chamber. The doors are shattered and lay broken, hanging off the hinges. The path is well worn and obviously frequently used. Muffled sounds and the faint odor of decay and mold emanate from the chamber.

A meandering path weaves its way through family plots. Upturned headstones have displaced a fair amount of soil at the gravesites where they fell, leaving gaping holes in the graves. Some of the dirt appears freshly turned. Despite their curiosity, most resist the morbid urge to peer into the holes.

The pathway leads to a small reflecting pool ending in an ornate monument, carved with animals, birds, and flowers in beautiful detail. Upon closer examination, the carvings have weathered so thoroughly they appear twisted and distorted. The beady eyes of the carvings are unnerving. Old wisteria vines choke the facade and sprawl up and over its enormous curve. The intertwining branches create shadows and odd patterns that resemble horrible faces. The scent of many blooms make it difficult to breathe. A portion of the wall beyond the monument has crumbled to dust, exposing a path over a small hill.

A path through the cemetery wall rises over a small hill. The shallow valley created by the hill is invisible from the cemetery and roadway. A thick, eerie fog blankets the area, a final resting place for the paupers and debtors unable to pay for fancy headstones. Nothing but huge holes in the ground remain of the former grave sites. It appears that some major wholesale grave robbing has occurred, but what could a pauper's grave hold of any value? Pieces of gray-green looking shreds are scattered on the ground.

A trail of detached skin and body parts leads to the edge of the valley. Decaying flesh beneath your feet squishes with each step. The small hill that surrounds the valley hides this pauper's cemetery from the Arena to the west. The hills were raised to hide the poorly kept graves from the general public. Shuffling, grunting and gurgling sounds echo between the hills. The eerie fog hangs heavily in the still air, as no wind penetrates the valley.

The trail in the mud continues past more gaping holes that were once grave sites. In this potter's field, there is no grass, no weeds, no flowers, no moss growing on the thick black mud. The ground is littered with shreds of partially decayed fibrous tissues. You instinctively cover your nose to ward off the powerful stench. The once distant sounds of shuffling and groaning grow nearer in the soupy fog. Surely, nothing living ends up here.

Weaving one's way around the large holes in the ground and scattered body parts is a chore. A chore made all the more difficult when also trying to locate the source of the ominous moaning from the foggy surroundings. The body parts become more recognizable the longer one stares at them. An eye looks up from the muck, eerily following your progress down the trail. A mischievous prankster has scribbled the words "Dead End" on a nearby rock.

The sunniest corner of the small cemetery is a flurry of color. Lilies, daisies, and nightshade bloom continuously between the stone wall and a solitary headstone. Small white snowdrops encircle the lone grave. Curiously, a pair of work boots lies upside down next to a man-sized hole directly in front of the headstone.  A small dagger, some curled orange peels, an empty earthen tankard, and a lunch sack are here.

The weathered remains of a mourner's pavilion cover this large square of paving stones. Tattered pieces of a long disintegrated fabric awning flutter in the breeze where they still remain attached to the carved stone supports. Several old splintered wooden benches lay on their sides, missing legs, backs, and seats. At one time they could have been turned in any direction, away from weather, or to face a particular burial plot.

The graves in this western section of the small plot are undisturbed. Tall statues display names, dates and epitaphs. The largest statue is a recreation of a beautiful woman, her shadowed eyes looking down towards the headstones. The marble figure wears a shawl and veil of weather stains and lichen. The dates and ages on the headstones speak of a plague that claimed many young lives.

As the silent pavilion watched, someone looted and plundered row upon row of graves, up-ending each headstone in an appalling lack of respect for the dead. Grave-robbers, angry at finding no worthwhile goods buried with these unfortunates, have torn up this side of the small cemetery. Alive with vermin, pile and stacks of bleached bones move on their own accord.

The Caretaker's hut leans precariously against the stone wall with its doors hanging askew. Rakes and hoes lay where they were discarded, caked in corrosion and mud. Old shovels, some missing handles, fill a disintegrating barrel held together only by its staves. Weeds and brambles riot about the small lean-to as if celebrating the caretaker's demise. Large spots and drips from some dark liquid cover the inside of the hut's walls. A softly whispering breeze tickles through the leaves and makes the dust dance in swirls.

In the most south-eastern corner of the burial grounds, a sprawling, ancient juniper tree straddles the block wall. The wrought iron fence perfectly bisects the tree and continues on. The tree's roots and and limbs cling to the wall in a marvel of adaptation and survival. Loose bark twists around the trunk as if a giant hand grabbed the tree and turned it slowly. The tortured tree shades the corrupted graves and skewed headstones.

A low stone wall, topped with an ornate iron work fence, surrounds and area of burial plots. The fence peaks in sharply pointed finials to discourage trespassers. The well masoned wall gracefully concludes in two pillared columns that support a creaking wrought iron fence.  An open black obsidian gate is here.

[Eastern Spur Road.]

A small gate stands between Eastern Spur Road and the small, weed infested path that heads north. Through the rusted and worn gate you can make out a few old headstones and crypts, but the vines and overgrown brush obstruct your view. The rumors of evil death-howls and unusual occurrences have the locals hurrying past this location as quickly as possible.  An open black obsidian gate is here.

Uneven cobblestones line the roadway. Worn down by time and heavy traffic, the large potholes have filled with water, debris and unidentifiable muck, and are more prevalent than the stone. Those who travel this way have grown accustomed to the trouble spots, and appear to be dancing to a strange, unheard tune as they bob and weave their way toward their destination.

Tall black spires rise from the building that towers above the hedge skirting the southern portion of Eastern Spur Road. Quickly whispered words and furtive gestures at the edifice seem enough to straighten out even the most unruly child. A distinctive howl pierces the air. Not many stop long enough to discern if it is just the wind or something far more sinister.

A large, well-kept gate is cut into the immense wall that surrounds Spur. Although everything else has fallen into disrepair, it is evident that security is still of foremost importance to the Governor. Uniformed guards patrol high above, conscientiously glancing down to assure peace is being kept along this well-traveled road. A crotchety old man leans against the wall, just out of view of the guards, counting the coin he has thus far appropriated this fine day.  An open iron gate and an open thick stone door are here.

Growing within the shadow of the large Spurian Wall, even the sparse trees look run down. A few sickly looking leaves cling to their gnarled limbs. A broken swing hangs from one of the stronger looking branches, and you feel sorry for the children who must live here.  An open iron gate is here.

Set within a wide tunnel leading through the hedge to the north is the Wilderness Gate. It separates the settled lands of Spur from the open plains to the south of the city. The plains stretch as far as the eyes can see, the horizon and the walls of the fort down the road the only blemishes of the grassy landscape in the distance. The stones of the road are smoothly set together, well built to withstand heavy travel. A broken wagon wheel, discarded some time ago, covers a spot of nearby grass, weeds trying to climb through the spokes.

The tradeway runs across the open grasslands northeast towards the Spur, and southwest towards distant lands and eventually, the coast. The plains to the south and east seem totally indifferent to your existence. Just ahead, a small path moves up a village of huts spread out in a semi-circle. In the center of the village a giant fire pit sits where barbarians who wander through the village can sit around to stay warm.  A worn grassy path is here.

The dark mist continues to surround you. Long agonizing moans echo around your ears, making it difficult for you to even think clearly. To the east, you can just barely make out the dim outline of the ship's broken mast.  Some gold coins, some silver coins, a small iron cooking pot, a smooth white sharpening stone, an open bright silver box, a closed flowery canvas bag, and an open mended canvas pouch are here.

This area is illuminated.
In the area are Fionna the Noble Secian and Orlando the Noble Human.
Obvious paths: north northeast east southeast south.
