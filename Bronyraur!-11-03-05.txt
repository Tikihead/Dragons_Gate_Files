[Circular Pit, Dragon Cavern.]

A winding tunnel opens above a large depression in the cavern floor. A wide ledge spirals its way down the contour of the circular pit, narrowing as it approaches the flat bed of the bottom. The upper concentric circles of the ledge accommodate several rocks. The large rocks are not made of the abundant sandstone of the caves; rather, they are chiseled obsidian. Most have narrow slits for claw perches, while some are crudely hewn into bowl shapes for seating. Sound reverberates magnificently within the bowl, causing any sound above a whisper to carry to any point in the chamber.   A ledge winding downward, a giant glossy black obsidian rock, a giant glossy black obsidian rock, a slick mottled obsidian bowl-shaped rock, a slick mottled obsidian bowl-shaped rock, a round carved sandstone tunnel mouth, and a light chain linked steel haubergeon are here.

[Circular Pit, Dragon Cavern.]

A winding tunnel opens above a large depression in the cavern floor. A wide ledge spirals its way down the contour of the circular pit, narrowing as it approaches the flat bed of the bottom. The upper concentric circles of the ledge accommodate several rocks. The large rocks are not made of the abundant sandstone of the caves; rather, they are chiseled obsidian. Most have narrow slits for claw perches, while some are crudely hewn into bowl shapes for seating. Sound reverberates magnificently within the bowl, causing any sound above a whisper to carry to any point in the chamber.   A ledge winding downward, a giant glossy black obsidian rock, a giant glossy black obsidian rock, a slick mottled obsidian bowl-shaped rock, a slick mottled obsidian bowl-shaped rock, a round carved sandstone tunnel mouth, a raw landshark filet, a raw landshark filet, and a raw landshark filet are here.

This room is illuminated.
In the room are Clara the Secian (holding a glowing pulsating glyph etched moonstone), Dracaen the Draco, Jyrayel the Noble Draco, Nyoko'a the Dragon (lying down), Viator the Drake, Smaugbane the Noble Draco (seated), Mikasi the Drake, Gaze the Noble Drake, Lilhyr the Draco, Depravato'a the Noble Dragon, Msanychta the Drake, and Bant the Drake (seated).

[Basin Rim, Dragon Cavern.]

A steep ramp of tightly packed clay, rocks, and detritus descends into a deep basin formed in the sandstone floor of the cavern. The smooth floor of the basin implies natural formation, but deep claw gouges along the sides, although smoothed by the passage of time, bespeak draconic assistance. From the rim of the basin a phantasmal form is visible. Standing perfectly still at the center of the basin it appears statuesque. A sudden flurry of graceful yet precise movement reveals the apparition to be progressing through a series of increasingly complex fighting stances and maneuvers. Each sharp jab, stab, slash, and cut is demonstrated wielding a gleaming scimitar in one hand and a short curved dagger in the other.   A ramp leading down is here.

>[Cavern Entrance.]

By swift passage of flood waters, or slow percolating of artesian wells, the towering walls of this sandstone cavern were eroded into eery eliptical shapes, creating an underground network of winding passages. Dozens of misshapen tunnels, chambers, and alcoves start or end in this cavern, their inky black mouths dotting the walls in every direction and height. Apertures in the uneven ground plunge thousands of feet through dripping mists and down into the dark bowels of the earth. Lining the cavern mouth exiting to the forested path are two precisely carved semicircles, one within the other. Their borders are cut several inches deep into the walls and the sandstone has been reinforced with a metallic substance within the double arch. Filling the gaps between the dual arches are deeply gouged draconic runes, glyphs, and wards, each crackling with pent-up azure energy.  A massive stone cavern opening is here.
