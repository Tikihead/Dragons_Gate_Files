[New South Lake.]

Brown murky water stretches out seemingly in every direction from here.  Small ripples in the water are the only evidences of animal life in the lake.  Otherwise, the lake seems almost dead.  You can barely see a hole in the murky depths of the lake.

This rather small passage has been cleared through the old cave-in.  A few loose stones fall free of the surrounding rubble and clatter to the floor around you.  In amongst the rocks and earth are old wooden beams like those used to support a mineshaft.  At some time in the past someone tried to mine this area.  It doesn't appear that it was such a good idea.

This room is not illuminated.

The tunnel through the rubble widens and forks here. It's obvious that this part of the old mining shaft is buried deep within the earth.

These carvings are different from those on the altar. The ones on the altar show the shamans, but the carvings on the wall depict the victims in agony only, how strange.

                        You have visualized the following locations
                        -------------------------------------------

                                    Visualization #1 is:
Through the gate lies the city of Spur, the major center of trade and civilization on the plains. The dusty road leading through the gates is well traveled, and walls of the city are in good repair. A small shack sits to the west of the road, during most times of the day a dusty coach can be seen waiting in front, its horses stomping with impatience to be gone. To the right of the door is a small window, its opening covered with metal bars. An old man, missing most of his teeth, waits patiently for the travelers to pay their fare, and then directs them into the waiting area. On the east side of the road a billowing multicolored tent has been erected, the hustle and bustle of merchants and customers can be seen coming and going at all times of the day.

                                    Visualization #2 is:
Each corner of this square gives entrance to one of the fort's four business establishments. The bank is small, but adequate. The pawnshop and store will see to your buying and selling needs, and the Tarath Wayside Inn is open at all hours to provide shelter for residents and foreigners alike.

                                    Visualization #3 is:
Carefully winding its way up the base of the tree, and wrapping itself around the stairs, a flowering jasmine vine grows tall and lush. Dark scars from a past fire are almost hidden under tufts of fresh growth and moss. A large gap, nearly sixteen feet in distance, rests between the base of a set of stairs and the forest floor. A long moonsilver cord hangs down the side of the tree. If one pulls it, the long Elven rope will descend from above, allowing them to enter the great city of Treehaven. Bright green leaves of clover have begun springing up through the ashy soil in conjunction with soft moss to lend a durable cushion to this well-traveled spot.

[Caves.]

The moaning you heard before in the tunnel leading to this altar room has grown to a deafening howl. The carvings on the walls move and shift. You could swear they are reaching out to you in torment to be freed from their eternal pain.  A giant gleaming blood-stained obsidian altar is here.

This room is not illuminated.
In the room are Tazzie the Noble Leuian, Hott the Noble Leuian, Kierra the Leuian, and Kenetic the Leuian.

The blood on the walls of this part of the cavern seems to still be wet, but you have no desire to test it.  Black shapeless shadows begin to separate from the walls, taking form before your eyes as they move away from the prison that has held them for so long.   A giant gleaming blood-stained obsidian altar is here.

This area is not illuminated.
In the area are Tazzie the Noble Leuian, Hott the Noble Leuian, Kierra the Leuian, and Kenetic the Leuian.

You follow Tazzie southeast...

[Caves.]

The walls of the cavern are not as smooth as those in the tunnel that led you here. Ancient carvings cover the wall, stained red by the blood of countless souls. Like those near the entrance to these caves they depict scenes of death and torture. It may be just a trick of the lighting in this room, but the carvings appear to be moving.   A giant gleaming blood-stained obsidian altar is here.

On this section of the altar the symbols get more graphic. They show the dark shamans sacrificing victims of many different races on the altar, offering up the blood to some unseen power. The shadows in the room flicker and sway, as the thick dust on the floor begins to swirl around you. Perhaps it would be best to keep moving.   A giant gleaming blood-stained obsidian altar is here.

A closer look at the altar reveals that the symbols depict scenes of some sort of religious ceremony. Dark shamans are depicted standing around a giant altar, their arms poised in various gestures of what appears to be religious importance. More symbols cover the other sides of the altar, and you will need to move around it to get a look.   A giant gleaming blood-stained obsidian altar and a closed darkened tigerskin sack are here.

The symbols on this portion of the altar reveal more of the horrific acts once performed in this room. The dark shamans are shown throwing the blood collected from their victims on the walls. It is hard to make out, but it appears that the soul of the victim passes from his or her body to the wall with the blood, forming a carving of that person, forever frozen in the moment of death.

The symbols on this portion of the altar reveal more of the horrific acts once performed in this room. The dark shamans are shown throwing the blood collected from their victims on the walls. It is hard to make out, but it appears that the soul of the victim passes from his or her body to the wall with the blood, forming a carving of that person, forever frozen in the moment of death.

You follow Kenetic east...

[Caves.]

A carefully cut hole in the eastern wall serves as the exit to this small chamber. The passage leading to the west is masterfully constructed and adorned with carvings and reliefs. They unsettle you to look at them, but what really bothers you more is trying to figure out by what magick the lake is kept from flooding the cave.  A light slick hard snakeskin vest and a bronze mace are here.

This room is not illuminated.
In the room are Tazzie the Noble Leuian, Hott the Noble Leuian, Kierra the Leuian, and Kenetic the Leuian.
Obvious exits: west.

Well braced and reinforced, the patterned walls and ceiling would turn the stomach of even the most hardened soul. It seems to get worse to the south. The dust on the floor shows little has passed this way of late.

[Caves.]

Out of the corner of your eye, the reliefs along the wall seem to dance and sway. When you turn to face them, they appear frozen. You aren't quite sure you want to touch them with anything to be sure though.  A shadowy black velvet coif and a golden brass lockpick are here.

There is something emanating from the southwest passage. Palpable waves of it crash into you, though since the dust is unmoving, it must be other than physical. The carvings keep moving now whether you stare at them or not.

There is something about this room that is just wrong. It tears at your very essence and seems to assault your soul. There is fresh air coming in off the lake beyond through a hole in the west wall, but it provides little relief from this.

The wildflowers release a delicate mist which envelops you, covering your skin with sparkling dew drops!

The dew upon you is quickly absorbed into your skin.
You have a tiny slash across your right arm, and look tired.

The passage seems to be blocked by rubble, but shows signs of recent digging. The ceiling appears to have collapsed quite some time ago. Barely visible beneath the rubble, you can see a pair of boots. Someone was unfortunate enough to have been caught in the fall.

You follow Kenetic through a tunnel...

[Caves.]

Cut off for many years, the air in this section of the caves is very thin and hard to breathe.  Thick dust hangs in the air from recent excavation and, unfortunately, the person buried by the old cave-in still lays covered by most of the rubble.  It appears that any attempt to remove him would cause the entire cave to collapse.  A small passage through the rubble leads off to the southwest.  A tunnel is here.

Cut off for many years, the air in this section of the caves is very thin and hard to breathe.  Thick dust hangs in the air from recent excavation and, unfortunately, the person buried by the old cave-in still lays covered by most of the rubble.  It appears that any attempt to remove him would cause the entire cave to collapse.  A small passage through the rubble leads off to the southwest.  A tunnel is here.

This rather small passage has been cleared through the old cave-in.  A few loose stones fall free of the surrounding rubble and clatter to the floor around you.  In amongst the rocks and earth are old wooden beams like those used to support a mineshaft.  At some time in the past someone tried to mine this area.  It doesn't appear that it was such a good idea.

The tunnel through the rubble widens and forks here. It's obvious that this part of the old mining shaft is buried deep within the earth. The unsettling sound of creaking timbers and falling stones continues to echo through the area. To the south a light greenish glow of some sort flickers just out of view.

Shadows dance on the strangely smooth walls, and a frightening moan joins in with the sounds of the settling earth around you. A sensation of pure horror and terror seeps up from the tunnels that lead deeper into the ground to the west, surrounding you and whispering in your mind, "Go back the way you came."

The passageway opens up into an immense cavern. A monstrous altar of gleaming obsidian blocks your view of the rest of the room. Intricate carvings, like those of the other section of the cave, cover the horrific altar and the strangely colored walls in this high-ceilinged cavern room.  A giant gleaming blood-stained obsidian altar is here.

The horrors of the symbols on the altar seem all the more real under the stain of the blood. Shadows in the room flicker on the walls and remind you to get a closer look at them.  These carvings are different from those on the altar. The ones on the altar show the shamans, but the carvings on the wall depict the victims in agony only, how strange.  A giant gleaming blood-stained obsidian altar is here.

The symbols on this portion of the altar reveal more of the horrific acts once performed in this room. The dark shamans are shown throwing the blood collected from their victims on the walls. It is hard to make out, but it appears that the soul of the victim passes from his or her body to the wall with the blood, forming a carving of that person, forever frozen in the moment of death.   A giant gleaming blood-stained obsidian altar is here.

The symbols on this portion of the altar reveal more of the horrific acts once performed in this room. The dark shamans are shown throwing the blood collected from their victims on the walls. It is hard to make out, but it appears that the soul of the victim passes from his or her body to the wall with the blood, forming a carving of that person, forever frozen in the moment of death.   A giant gleaming blood-stained obsidian altar is here.

Dark shamans are depicted standing around a giant altar, their arms poised in various gestures of what appears to be religious importance. More symbols cover the other sides of the altar, and you will need to move around it to get a look.   A giant gleaming blood-stained obsidian altar is here.

The shadows in the room flicker and sway, as the thick dust on the floor begins to swirl around you. Perhaps it would be best to keep moving.   A giant gleaming blood-stained obsidian altar, a stained-glass vial of elvish water, a tomato stained chef's apron, and an open mended sack are here.

On this section of the altar the symbols get more graphic. They show the dark shamans sacrificing victims of many different races on the altar, offering up the blood to some unseen power. The shadows in the room flicker and sway, as the thick dust on the floor begins to swirl around you. Perhaps it would be best to keep moving.   A giant gleaming blood-stained obsidian altar, a stained-glass vial of elvish water, a tomato stained chef's apron, an open downy leopardskin bag, and an open mended sack are here.

A closer look at the altar reveals that the symbols depict scenes of some sort of religious ceremony. Dark shamans are depicted standing around a giant altar, their arms poised in various gestures of what appears to be religious importance. More symbols cover the other sides of the altar, and you will need to move around it to get a look.   A giant gleaming blood-stained obsidian altar is here.

The passageway opens up into an immense cavern. A monstrous altar of gleaming obsidian blocks your view of the rest of the room. Intricate carvings, like those of the other section of the cave, cover the horrific altar and the strangely colored walls in this high-ceilinged cavern room.  A giant gleaming blood-stained obsidian altar is here.

This room is not illuminated.

Shadows dance on the strangely smooth walls, and a frightening moan joins in with the sounds of the settling earth around you.

The tunnel through the rubble widens and forks here. It's obvious that this part of the old mining shaft is buried deep within the earth.

This rather small passage has been cleared through the old cave-in.  A few loose stones fall free of the surrounding rubble and clatter to the floor around you.  In amongst the rocks and earth are old wooden beams like those used to support a mineshaft.  At some time in the past someone tried to mine this area.  It doesn't appear that it was such a good idea.

Cut off for many years, the air in this section of the caves is very thin and hard to breathe.  Thick dust hangs in the air from recent excavation and, unfortunately, the person buried by the old cave-in still lays covered by most of the rubble.  It appears that any attempt to remove him would cause the entire cave to collapse.  A small passage through the rubble leads off to the southwest.  A tunnel is here.

The stones of the road are smoothly set together, well built to withstand heavy travel.

A bored Flerian, leaning against the city wall, glances at you with hooded eyes as you pass by. He turns and slinks through a small hole at the base of the wall. Beautiful golden grasslands grow in a large clearing to the west.

The city wall stands ominously to the east of the road, an impenetrable mass of stone. Its presence dominates your vision and the road stands in deep, dark shadow until mid-day. Archer towers to the north rise above the top of the wall, indicating the West Gate is near.  A green bush is here.

Four draft horses stomp at the ground in annoyance as two miners struggle with the broken wheel of a horse-cart, filled to the top with glittering dark ore. One heavily muscled Hithual curses fluently in Battle as he attempts to leverage the cart with a plank from its own sideboard. The attempt to thread the axle with a new wheel fails, setting off shouts of pain and frustration.

[Spur Gateway.]

Travelers from Rathan to the northwest, and the Trade Route to the south, converge at Spur's west gate. Guards posted on the ground give those seeking to enter the city a cursory once-over. Their lack of interest shows that anyone approaching has already been observed from above for some time. A grate in the ground loosens mud from wagon wheels and hooves before they pass through the gate, helping to keep the streets of Spur fairly clean.  An open giant black iron gate, a giant green oak tree, a small blue pool, a thick oak grate over the pool, and a polished stone marker are here.

[Gateway.]

The relative safety inside Spur is a comfort to those returning from the fields and mountains. To those leaving, a massive wall of defense around the city lies ahead. Archer towers beside the gate overlook the wall, offering a painful welcome to would-be invaders. Several guards on foot patrol pass and disappear behind a thick, bluesteel banded steelwood door. Wall road stretches to the south, a wide passage between the city wall and several large buildings.  An open iron gate, an open thick stone door, and a street lantern are here.

From the city gate to the west, Trade Way continues eastward towards the busy Merchant district, past Joyeusse's Shop. The air is thick with the scent of fresh flowers. Wagons filled with goods bound for sale trundle past, their drivers hopeful of the anticipated profits. Eager young warriors venture towards the west gate and the dangers beyond.  A closed carved rosewood door, a street lantern, and a freshly painted sign are here.

The wafting smell of flowers and trees float out from a well kept grey fence.  Old piles of rubble have been cleaned up and the glimpse of a sprawling park can be seen, having been planted in their stead. Beautiful and statuesque monuments dot the landscape through the gate, that remains locked, but has been festively decorated with a bright ribbon.  A street lantern and an open festive ribbon tied grey iron gate are here.

The buildings of Market Circle stand to the south. It becomes obvious that the area through the arch is a much cleaner marketplace than the bazaar. An inviting eatery stands beside the road, its door open to those weary after a long trip to Spur, as well as those preparing to venture to the great expanses beyond the west gate. A human couple exit the building, arm in arm. A small sign stands beside the intersection.  A sign, an open glossy lacquered oak door, and a street lantern are here.

Adventurers with sacks of plundered goods leave Market Street and head west where a shrewd businessman has set up shop in this busy area of the Market District. A small shop stands slightly to the east of the arch leading into Merchant Circle, light shining through its red glass door and illuminating the store front in a cheerful, ruby glow.  A street lantern, an opaque ruby red glass door, and a gold lettered wooden sign are here.

>[Market Circle.]

An arch between two large buildings connects Market Circle and Market Street. The more reputable shopkeepers do business within the circle, but pay higher taxes for the privilege. The buildings have been built to last, as these merchants are no traveling tinkers. Interlocking stone walkways and colorful plantings span this central area. Despite the number of animals waiting outside the bank for their owners, the area is spotless. Loud chatter in many languages can be heard from the southwest.  A marble archway, an open elegant gold-trimmed walnut door, and a wooden sign are here.

Market Street ends here at a large archway. People bustle in and out of the arch, some without so much as a nod. The city wall rises up to the south and west of the buildings of Market Circle. A small sign is posted on the wall beside the archway.  A street lantern is here.

Situated between the well-traveled Trade Way to the north and the fine shops of Market Circle to the south, this small stretch of road is busy at all times of day. Adventurers with sacks of plundered goods leave Market Street and head west where a shrewd businessman has set up shop in this busy area of the Market District. A small shop stands slightly to the east of the arch leading into Merchant Circle, light shining through its red glass door and illuminating the store front in a cheerful, ruby glow.  A street lantern, an opaque ruby red glass door, and a gold lettered wooden sign are here.

>[Trade & Market.]

The buildings of Market Circle stand to the south. It becomes obvious that the area through the arch is a much cleaner marketplace than the bazaar. An inviting eatery stands beside the road, its door open to those weary after a long trip to Spur, as well as those preparing to venture to the great expanses beyond the west gate. A human couple exit the building, arm in arm. A small sign stands beside the intersection.  A sign, an open glossy lacquered oak door, and a street lantern are here.

[Trade Way.]

This well-worn road separates the Bazaar to the north and Market Circle to the south. Only a Thugian could appreciate the layered odors of simmering foodstuffs and shoppers from the Bazaar. Crowds of people push past, some brushing against you. It might be a good idea to keep an eye on your coinpurse.  A street lantern is here.

A path to the north winds its way among various stalls and tents. Some specialty outlets can be found, provided one does not get lost in this maze known as the Bazaar. More permanent structures to the south suggest finer goods as well as increased security.  A street lantern is here.

Many townsfolk pass along this busy thoroughfare. Rich and poor alike mix freely on this street, much to the dismay of a passing nobleman. A young human struggles with an armful of packages and two young children in tow. Those in need of goods or supplies head west towards the market, those looking for the news of the day head east towards Town Square.  A street lantern is here.

A large gate separates the Merchant District and Town Square-the hub of Spur's activity. The partially opened gate is currently able to accommodate the simultaneous passage of several locals and visitors, but can be expanded to accept carriages, or sealed to ward against invasion.  Guards stand sentry from atop the wall as well as the ground.  A street lantern is here.

>[Merchant Walk.]

Merchant Walk comes to an abrupt end at a massive moonsilver gate. The towering walls of Spur on either side of the gates force all to pass by the guards who are constantly on the watch for thieves and bandits. Just beyond the gates one can glimpse the bustling Merchant District of Spur.  A gilded oak sign and a street lantern are here.

Several city guardsmen have just finished wrestling to the ground some young tough thieves, who thought to rob one of the returning merchants. To one side a relieved-looking Fir Elf gentleman holds on tightly to his gold-tipped walking stick, as the human boy yells his innocence to any who might listen. His pleas fall on deaf ears as the guards drag him away.  A street lantern is here.

Merchants, some in frilly finery, others dressed in homespun wools, travel back and forth along this street on their way to and from work. They seem to blend together here, if only briefly.

A neatly kept park fronts this portion of Merchant Walk. Topiary and low shrubberies partition off small sections of the park. Young lovers sit on benches almost hidden from view, gazing at each other with looks of love, oblivious to the continual bustle of passing customers and merchants on their way to do business.

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.   A flowing white marble fountain, a marble statue of a Human, a highly polished marble statue of a Dragon, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, and a rosewood sign are here.

The elegant Hotel Royale towers above the street, its emerald door sparkling in the light. The patrons that stroll in and out are catered to, doors opened and closed for them, and baggage and packages carried by harried servants. The large Bank of Spur sits on the east side of the square. Its location close to the Royale is not a coincidence. A gold-trimmed door is proof of the success of this branch of the Spurian bank and those who run it.  An elegant gold-trimmed walnut door, an open emerald steel door, a street lantern, and a new rosewood sign pointing southeast are here.
