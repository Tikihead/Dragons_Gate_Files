Tyviel'a just picked up a tiny green pile of Kirrra.

Cyraenthalis says, "I think he just wanted to hear his own voice."

Maiz asks Tyviel'a, "You suggested that some sort of scenerio has begun for secian/dragons. Are you refering to the demon gate? Or did something start that I am not aware and if so what was it?"

Cyraenthalis says to Maiz, "The gemmies."

Cyraenthalis just opened the closed brass buckled doeskin satchel.

Cyraenthalis just removed a closed velvet burgundy bag of runestones from within her open brass buckled doeskin satchel.

Gellidus says, "Cant say that I have"

Gellidus smirks.

Maiz asks Tyviel'a, "Pern? Really? Any other references?"

Raptorian drools over pern books.

Tyviel'a says, "Pern series of fantasy books. One of the first to deal with dragons."

Tyviel'a says, "The females are definitely bigger, as you can tell."

Elee grumbles.

Litorth'a says, "I'd say that females being larger would tend to be more powerful but I wouldnt expect any male dragon to admit to it."

Tyviel'a says, "I have not sat down and talked with the designers of the game, but it is obvious some of the racial ideas were pulled from there. But that does not mean you are Pern dragons."

Cyraenthalis says to Kiralyn, "I've been bugging you to read them now for a while."

Cyraenthalis leans on Tyviel'a.

Gellidus asks Tyviel'a, "So it's nothing that was set down by an elder a long time ago?"

Firebreath grins.

Tyviel'a says, "I doubt it. I think watching your fellow dragons is all you need to know. Your older drakes, your third stagers."

Firebreath coughs.

Tyviel'a asks Gellidus, "in my opinion? No."

Firebreath stares at Litorth'a.

Cyraenthalis asks, "Um...I have a question about the female reverting to draco thingie. Just curious. Do they revert to draco when they get pregnant, or about to give birth?"

Lilioth winks at Litorth'a.

Tyviel'a says, "That is more do what your character would do, Gellidus. Argue with Aeslyn, make your viewpoint the best. I am sure you did anyway."

Lebelle glances.

Gellidus says to Tyviel'a, "You bet I did"

Gellidus snickers.

Lilyth chuckles.

Lilyth hugs Voskresenieye.

Vrice says to Gellidus, "Dont argue with a brick wall not good for ya"

Tyviel'a says to Cyraenthalis, "we would have to have an account of that to know for sure. A birthing dragon does not tend to have a lot of observers around."

Gellidus nods to Vrice.

Lilioth nods to Paveuni.

Cyraenthalis asks, "So...it doesn't matter?"

Tyviel'a says, "It is not terribly important at this time. It is part of the history that will be lore for now."

Tyviel'a smiles at Cyraenthalis.

Tyviel'a says, "A community needs to be close knit, so the leaning is to allow it to stay within the lairs. All of which could be or will be explained in game. However, I will personally state I do not see an Imperial allowing it to happen."

Gellidus says to Glinka, "In Norius'a's lair, your idea might be a good idea too"

Tyviel'a says, "But there are always weird characters out there."

Litorth'a says, "I think it would re-inforce the rp that a lair is a dragons home not some public training spot if they were moved out. Seemed like some people were treating them more as public property then a home at times."

Raptorian says to Lilioth, "It did."

Tyviel'a asks Lilioth, "we? You as a player would, but I doubt your 500 year old dragon would want to be."

Cyraenthalis says, "I think the word soon should be cut out of the DGate language."

Vermithrax says, "at level 40 SC"

Cyraenthalis asks, "When they get to 3rd do they get more vis spots? I mean, they'd have a bigger brain for useless stuff."

Lilioth exclaims, "oh good!"

Losmir says, "If you're 500 years old, I think that would be enough time to get to level 40 SC"

Cyraenthalis asks, "When they get to 3rd do they get more vis spots? I mean, they'd have a bigger brain for useless stuff."

Syl says to Cyraenthalis, ""soon" has been around in the gaming industry for a long time, I've played d-gate off and on 11 years, you get used to soon."

Lilyth, the air shimmering with warmth, just appeared.

Cyraenthalis says, "I figured."

Cyraenthalis exclaims, "Second question!"

Cyraenthalis asks, "Um...I'm back. Hi. I'm wondering what your thoughts are on staging. Is it more...in charry for a draco/drake to stage with just their Secian, or...with a big, massive group of people watching you squirm like a fish out of water?"

Tyviel'a says, "I will ask if they are considering opening more vis spots. I doubt they are though. Traveling is encouraged for more encounters."

Elee says to Cyraenthalis, "Player's choice ;D"

Equality's stomach growls.

Grysmor's stomach growls.

Kavita says, "but people kill secians alot and we forgive em"

Kavita shrugs.

Tyviel'a says, "Your choice entirely. For example arachnians hate any magick users, but we would not encourage them all to kill any magick possessing character. Especially without the proper RPing behind it."

Lilioth exclaims, "Especially in Spur!"

Cyraenthalis says, "Unless it's just for the sparklies...."

Kiralyn snickers at Cyraenthalis.

Tyviel'a says, "I also believe that secian who Bond share some of the dragon's feelings on things, and would be more willing to understand a dragon's viewpoint on hunting. But, again, that is personal choice."

Equality accepts Lilyth's offer.

Lilyth snickers.

Cyraenthalis says to Kiralyn, "It could be. I know I'd love Cyra if she gave me as many sparklies as she gives Kira."

Cyraenthalis says to Kiralyn, "Okay. I'd love her /more./"

Tyviel'a says, "So there is your straight forward answer. Obviously do not harm a living creature on hunts, but up to your character and how they view things on accompany hunters in yelicans, hydras, etc."

Tyviel'a says to Grysmor, "there is no real answer, it is a grey area."

Tyviel'a smiles.

Grysmor nods to Tyviel'a.

Grysmor says, "you answered it fine"

Darrow leans on Fey.
