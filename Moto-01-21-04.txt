The white paving stones give way to a boardwalk made of wooden planks.  The wood doesn't appear to be of Spurian make, and looks a great deal older, but very sturdy.

                                    Visualization #2 is:
The platform has been swept recently, revealing the new boards that have replaced some of the burned ones.  The remains of the old bank to the south have been completely cleared away, leaving just the shell of the old building there.  Intricately crafted stairs lead from the platform to the new building that resides in the upper branches.

                                    Visualization #3 is:
A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.

New wooden planks fit side by side creating the walkway that extends proudly upon the reconstructed supports.

A staircase here seems to have some enchantment, judging by the strange appearance of unicorns, bears and owls on the lower steps. Strange, due to the fact that they don't appear carved, painted, or put there by any hand-made means. It is as if the glyphs grew into the wood itself. Mysterious symbols are scattered throughout the portraits, which shimmer with a golden whisper as they are approached.

A large tapestry lines the outside wall of the passageway, most impressive in that it is not made of fabric, but of vines as tiny as thick hairs, growing in a weave. The delicate shadings of the plants is perfectly natural, and as the eye becomes unfocused, a picture of a diminutive, beautiful maiden sits amongst a foresty background. The wall opposite of this magnificent tapestry is lined with portraits of prominent temple leaders, the colors vibrant, bringing a life-like sense to the frames. The eyes of the maiden in the tapestry seem to follow you, staring directly as you pass, boring into your soul.  A vellum portrait, a canvas portrait, a suede portrait, some unfinished portraits, and a carefully painted silk screen are here.

The hum of busy bees and hummingbirds add a tone of unity to the soft chants of the priests and murmurings of those here to offer up the sacrifices and tithes to the great Goddess, Elindale. Several monks wearing floor length robes sit in silence, with the occasional clasped hands rising up in a particularly vibrant part of prayer. The altar itself is composed of growing flowers, the tiny buds enclosing gems and gold alike. Around the base of the altar grows a ring of mushrooms, vibrantly cloaked in red with white spots dotting the umbrellas.

[Elindale's Temple.]

A large tapestry lines the outside wall of the passageway, most impressive in that it is not made of fabric, but of vines as tiny as thick hairs, growing in a weave. The delicate shadings of the plants is perfectly natural, and as the eye becomes unfocused, a picture of a diminutive, beautiful maiden sits amongst a foresty background. The wall opposite of this magnificent tapestry is lined with portraits of prominent temple leaders, the colors vibrant, bringing a life-like sense to the frames. The eyes of the maiden in the tapestry seem to follow you, staring directly as you pass, boring into your soul.  A vellum portrait, a canvas portrait, a suede portrait, some unfinished portraits, and a carefully painted silk screen are here.

New wooden planks fit side by side creating the walkway that extends proudly upon the reconstructed supports. The view of the forest to the northwest is quite panoramic, despite the burnt spikes of trees in the midst. A staircase here seems to have some enchantment, judging by the strange appearance of unicorns, bears and owls on the lower steps. Strange, due to the fact that they don't appear carved, painted, or put there by any hand-made means. It is as if the glyphs grew into the wood itself. Mysterious symbols are scattered throughout the portraits, which shimmer with a golden whisper as they are approached.

The remains of the old bank to the south have been completely cleared away, leaving just the shell of the old building there.  Intricately crafted stairs lead from the platform to the new building that resides in the upper branches.

                                    Visualization #3 is:
A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.

The white paving stones give way to a boardwalk made of wooden planks.  The wood doesn't appear to be of Spurian make, and looks a great deal older, but very sturdy.

The platform has been swept recently, revealing the new boards that have replaced some of the burned ones.  The remains of the old bank to the south have been completely cleared away, leaving just the shell of the old building there.  Intricately crafted stairs lead from the platform to the new building that resides in the upper branches.

                                    Visualization #3 is:
A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.

Beside a bright red brick building, a tall, silver haired figure in robes waits behind a small cart. His pale skin is visible only on his hands. An eerie apparatus sits off to the side of the wooden cart. Strange images have been carved into the wood, which flicker slowly with the passing light of travelers, who saunter between Golden Crossing and the central circle of the business district.  A silver-trimmed wooden sign, a rune etched wooden cart, some fragrant crimson roses, and a glowing rune inscribed cobblestone walkway are here.

An enchanted weeping willow grows in the center of the Business District. Its leaves are a shimmering green color, veined with golden threads. The long, graceful branches of the tree sway slowly with the rushing exhale of the sea. As the leaves tatter with the wind, a faint, soothing music chimes throughout the circle. The song seems to lull a group of men to slumber as they stretch out and doze on a circle of benches that crown the base of the tree. Stacks of packages and bags become foot rests and pillows for the exhausted gentlemen.  Some filigree crafted iron benches, an enchanted gold-threaded weeping willow, and a glowing rune inscribed cobblestone walkway are here.

On the south side of the building, an archway leading to a small passage way separates the bank from the black marble tower.  An open sun carved gold door and a gold etched silver arch are here.

Polished pine racks filled with a plethora of colored garments to cover the legs are attached to a far wall. The articles of clothing are separated by size and style. A rather large, hairy thugian grunts empathically as he tries to fit into a broadcloth skirt made for a leuian. A young human grits her teeth at the sight and quickly scurries out of the area.

Small speckles of silver shimmer faintly under the street lanterns and magical energy of the tower, as silver coins, either discarded or lost, catch the glowing light. Behind the tower and bank, several smaller buildings of stone and wood have been constructed along Silver Alley. Black, red, and blue streamers drape from one side of the alley to the other, making festive arches high over head, as merchants and shoppers move hurriedly through the passage.

The bank of Emjedah is a magnificent building of deep mahogany. At the top of the structure, a glorious rising sun has been carved into the wood, sitting against the backdrop of the sea and eastern horizon. Delicate golden threads bleed from the sun in swirling lines, decorating the sculpted columns which give the building its fortified appearance. On the south side of the building, an archway leading to a small passage way separates the bank from the black marble tower.  An open sun carved gold door and a gold etched silver arch are here.

An enchanted weeping willow grows in the center of the Business District. Its leaves are a shimmering green color, veined with golden threads. The long, graceful branches of the tree sway slowly with the rushing exhale of the sea. As the leaves tatter with the wind, a faint, soothing music chimes throughout the circle. The song seems to lull a group of men to slumber as they stretch out and doze on a circle of benches that crown the base of the tree. Stacks of packages and bags become foot rests and pillows for the exhausted gentlemen.  Some filigree crafted iron benches, an enchanted gold-threaded weeping willow, and a glowing rune inscribed cobblestone walkway are here.

Beside a bright red brick building, a tall, silver haired figure in robes waits behind a small cart. His pale skin is visible only on his hands. An eerie apparatus sits off to the side of the wooden cart. Strange images have been carved into the wood, which flicker slowly with the passing light of travelers, who saunter between Golden Crossing and the central circle of the business district.  A silver-trimmed wooden sign, a rune etched wooden cart, some fragrant crimson roses, and a glowing rune inscribed cobblestone walkway are here.

The glowing cobblestone pathway nestles itself between a valley of colorful buildings, which stand one after the other as if they lean on each other for support. Wooden, crystal, and metal signs hang over brightly painted doorways where storekeepers greet customers with merry if sometimes sly grins as they showcase their wares. The streets are filled with baskets and wagons of freshly baked goods, handmade crafts, potions, and other unique items.  Some wild crimson roses, a shimmering midnight blue crystal sign, an open tinted blue glass door, and a glowing rune inscribed cobblestone walkway are here.

Along the base of the fountain, crystallized inscriptions of ancient runes glow as gushes of water spiral and dance in the fountain's small pool.

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.

This wall-less shelter functions as a gathering place for meals, meetings and celebrations. Rows of sturdy tables and benches have been secured to the smooth raised wooden floor of the shelter, enough seating for the entire commune and then some. Long woven reed mats lay folded at the corners of the shelter. The tightly woven mats fasten at the edges of the roof and floor with tiny, metal hooks to keep out the elements and keep in the heat and easily remove again to allow for open ventilation during the hot months. Due to the erratic hours many of the hunters keep, one can find a hearty meal here at almost any time.  An exit is here.

You stand beside a large fire pit at the center of the semi-circle of simply constructed buildings.

Standing at the cliff's edge, with the waterfall roaring in your ears, you view the wide expanse of Sky Lake. Surrounded by verdant forest, it gleams brilliant cerulean on even the most overcast of days. At this height, you can see smoke curling up from the far shore, a possible sign of settlement.

Galin the Drag-al bartender laughs loudly at his own jokes as he prepares drinks for the assembled patrons. A long mahogany bar with several stools takes up most of the tavern, while a few small tables lie against the far wall. A wide selection of drinks and food from the inn's kitchen below is available on the menu.  A pair of swinging mahogany doors and a spiraling oak staircase are here.

The platform has been swept recently, revealing the new boards that have replaced some of the burned ones.  The remains of the old bank to the south have been completely cleared away, leaving just the shell of the old building there.  Intricately crafted stairs lead from the platform to the new building that resides in the upper branches.

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.

After a few large crashes and bangs, he returns with the closed item now open, although usually a bit worse for the wear.  Some stone stairs are here.

                                    Visualization #1 is:
A small wooden bridge crosses a stream that flows out of the forest and into the river. The bridge is in very good shape. It can only be a few years old, much younger than the crumbling road it services.
Hrothgi trans boundary

                                    Visualization #2 is:
The platform has been swept recently, revealing the new boards that have replaced some of the burned ones.  The remains of the old bank to the south have been completely cleared away, leaving just the shell of the old building there.  Intricately crafted stairs lead from the platform to the new building that resides in the upper branches.

                                    Visualization #3 is:
A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.
