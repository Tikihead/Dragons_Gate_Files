>[Cordelia's Nightwears.]

The soft light of glowing lanterns glistens upon the silky threads of oversized cobwebs. Lying within the delicately woven tangle of each web, an original design dangles. Noble women and men saunter cautiously around the room, clinging to their coin purses, as knobby knee'd Go-blin-als murmur and wrinkle their noses in disgust at the merchant's goods.   An open billowy black and orange satin curtain, an open canvas sack, a short steel butcher knife, and an obsidian and copper goblet are here.

Twinkling orange and black silk streamers, entwined in twists and swirls, hang all around this platform of the tree of shadows. From the center of the tree, a twinkling black spider hangs from an intricately woven cobweb. As the spider dangles, small prisms of light dance around the black silk lined walls of the tree. Eerie music and sounds carry on the air as a satin curtain gently billows with a hasty draft.  A vine-covered ladder, an open billowy black and orange satin curtain, and a giant glistening cobweb are here.

The wind whines a slow, lingering wail through small cracks within the willow's wood.  A small platform winds itself around the bough and meets the entrance of a peculiar room with a crooked red door. At the foot of the door, two carved pumpkins glow with a soft yellowish light. Black shadows march across the innards of the tree like a parade of urchins of the night as tall and small figures in costume climb up a small wooden ladder.  Some steep spiraling stairs, an open crooked red wooden door, and a vine-covered ladder are here.

Wavering white-hot orange flames swirl from a large opal disk that hovers as a centerpiece in this immense tree. Gnarled wooden stairs spiral and climb up the walls of the rounded bough, disappearing into a dark zenith. Shapeless figures dance and undulate on the walls, creating a spectacle of slow spinning shadows that unfurl into jackals and snakes. Howls of delights roar then fade into the distance as merrymakers disappear down a slithering slide, which cascades into a void of darkness way below.  An open star etched amber door, some steep spiraling stairs, and a wickedly curled slide are here.

Snakelike flames lick the air above, as shadows stand motionlessly against the hasty draft that cuts like a serpent's tongue through the underground roots. A circlet of paper demons crowns the tree's lifeless roots, which dig into the earth like knotted joints. Tiny black bugs cover the base of the tree's trunk as small figures burrow themselves in a large dark hole.  A small dark dirt hole is here.

Walls of pressed earth and roughly cut stone surround a haphazard assortment of various trinkets and tools scattered across the floor. Two matching boxes sit next to each other near the burrows entrance. Feeble light flickers from a small magickally glowing yellowish ball, which is encased within a metal lantern that sits on a black wooden desk. Shadows obscure a pair of closed, locked boxes jutting out from underneath the desk.  A small dark dirt hole, a narrow dirt tunnel, and a pair of glowing demon carved pumpkins are here.

[Skirtleby's Morsel Shoppe.]

Tiny morsels overflow from glass jars, as steam swirls from a cauldron of bubbling witches' brew. Dressed in a bloodstained apron, a cross-eyed Go-blin-al stands behind the wooden counter that is formed from an oversized tree root. Tattered garlands, stolen from the Elindale festival, decorate the small shoppe. As a foul smelling wind stirs the air, the small merchant fans a crooked hand behind him. Baskets of freshly baked pastries and body parts tantalize the senses with delightful repulsion, while cheerfully dressed Secians circle around the black cloth covered tables, escaping the grasp of snot nosed patrons.  A glowing stone fireplace, some short black and gold tables and chairs, a narrow dirt tunnel, and an open dusty wooden trapdoor are here.

Crimson, golden, and orange leaves tangle harshly with the wind as the night air cuts through the twisted branches boastfully. An ashen tree, whose branches are like a crippled old woman's hand, hangs heavily over a large glass tank. Red crystal apples bob rapidly as the chill of night stirs the water inside the tank. As the water churns and the wind rushes through the trees, a flock of black birds escape hastily from the branches above, sending a whirlwind of leaves to the ground.  An apple filled glass tank and a pair of glowing vine-covered pumpkins are here.

Sinuous vines twist around the tree trunks and stretch themselves from one tree to the next.  Crimson and orange leaves swirl lightly as a soft breeze blows through.  Two of the smaller trees bend towards each other, their upper branches entwining and forming a natural arch.  A shimmering spiderweb curtain hangs from the archway, glowing softly from behind.    A shimmering spiderweb curtain and a pumpkin are here.

A skeletal tree stands like an imposing ghoul against the starlit purplish black landscape of night. The tree's long, leafless branches whip furiously with the wind as small orange lights flicker from small, crooked windows carved into the monstrous bough. Shrilled laughter mixed with eerie cries of terror carry on the hasty wind as a star etched wooden door swings on its hinges from the base of the tree.  A pair of glowing vine-covered pumpkins and an open star etched amber door are here.

A gnarled willow tree stands like a towering shadow over a small crooked shack. The tree's long, skeletal branches blow furiously with the wind, stinging the frigid air like a whip. A misty trail of white smoke slinks steadily in coiled rings from a stone chimney that hardly balances on the slanted rooftop. A silver trimmed owl rests like an ancient sentinel on the stacked stones. Its golden eyes reflect the halo of the full moon. Shrilled laughter mixed with eerie cries of terror carry on the hasty wind as the star etched wooden door swings on its hinges.  An open star etched wooden door and some glowing intricately carved pumpkins are here.

Curls of flames lick the crisp black night air as a cloud of smoke eddies upward, weaving a snaky trail through the velvet sky lit by twilight. The sweet, spicy scent of burning wood carries on the air, giving warmth to the stinging chill of the rushing wind. A circle of merrymakers sit around the fire, warming their hands as others chase and dance through the leafless trees that stand like wicked figures in the darkness.  A flaming bonfire and a glowing large rune inscribed pumpkin are here.

A high pitched cackle rings madly from behind a large iron door. Large white sheets with painted faces dangle from the ceiling, as a cool draft blows in from the creaking star etched wooden door. Bales of hale are scattered across the dusty floor as patrons await their "surgery." An extremely tall, lanky fellow stands beside the iron door, insisting that he was once the size of a Secian.  An open star etched wooden door, some bales of hay, some bales of hay, and an open heavy iron door are here.

A serpentine trail of red mist spirals about a glorious marble fountain. A steady stream of murky water pores steadily from a carved marble pumpkin held in the hands of a rider upon a ghostly horse. Black and orange silk streamers, twisting and swirling in the wind, decorate on a creaking wrought iron fence. Three old women, dressed in shanty black robes, stand around a black cauldron chanting a curse to all who dare to enter the maze.  Three old witches, an intricately carved marble fountain, a closed wrought iron gate, and an open blood-stained calfhide bag are here.

Large plump pumpkins dot the outline of a vast grassy field. A few, holding lit candles, are carved with intricate patterns. A gentle breeze carries a sweet scent of colored autumn leaves as the twist their way to the ground. Towering high above the others, a maple tree with strong arms hangs languidly over a festively painted gypsy wagon.  A pair of glowing intricately carved pumpkins, a large colorful maple tree, an open billowy painted wooden wagon, and some bales of hay are here.

Hiding behind the shadow of the moon, this small village wears the black veil of night as it nestles itself behind the aura the eclipsed hour. A narrow trail ribbons itself through a maze of lifeless trees that frame the wayside of a rolling river. The wind fills the air with the scent of burning wood as its beckoning call echoes the eerie cry of howling wolves. Amidst the glowing light of lanterns, shady figures parade and dance through the heavy velvet blanket of night.  A giant orange pumpkin, a dirt path, and an ominous twisted opal arch are here.
