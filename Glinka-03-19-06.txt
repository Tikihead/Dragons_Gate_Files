A large sand pit is watched over by several grizzled veterans. Here the prospective fighter seeks to hone his skills to new heights. Though they use only wooden weapons and shields, occasionally the blows are so loud all those in the guild stop to turn their heads in wonder. For those mercenaries who lack the higher level of schooling, a sign posted nearby explains it all in monosyllables.  A wooden sign, an open drathain bound equipment chest, a drathain trimmed sign, and an open thick white oak door are here.

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.  A flowing white marble fountain, a marble statue of a Human, a shimmering marble statue of a Dragon, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a rosewood sign, a crisp gold lettered vellum notice, a fluffy white layer of snow, a glistening white snow fort, and a pile of sparkling snow balls are here.

>[Town Square North.]

The traffic on the northern street heading away from town square is an eclectic bunch.  Those who belong to the guilds to the north travel in packs on their way to and from guild events.  It is not unusual to see a group of armored fighters passing a group of robed clerics, each heading in the opposite direction. The large temple of Rinanni rises to the north, its white marble almost glowing in the light.  A street lantern and a fluffy white layer of snow are here.

This area is illuminated.
You see the 1st city guard mage and the 2nd city guard mage.

Beds of wildflowers line the carefully placed cobblestones along this street. A pair of love birds, cooing in delight, sit upon a white marble bench. The giggles and laughs of a pair of trysting lovers echoes from the room in the Traveler's Hostel to the east. It is certain that Rinanni looks down upon this scene with delight.  A white marble bench and a street lantern are here.

This room is illuminated.
You see the 1st cleric of unknown.

A peaceful bliss pervades the very core of this guilded path. Below a large oak tree a couple of Rinannian priestesses sing lightly in Secti. Several merchants pause to listen to the song. Even a few hardened warriors cannot help but smile at the sweet melody.  A large oak tree, an open dragon-etched emerald door, and a street lantern are here.

[Northern Avenue.]

The distant glimmer from a temple made of white marble and pearl catches your eye. An intricate gilded iron gate and a small winding path are all that separate you from the dazzling temple of Rinanni. Majestic marble statues of doves in flight stand on either side of the gate. The gaze of their peaceful eyes seems to follow your every movement.  An open intricately gilded iron gate, a pair of pure white marble dove statues, and a street lantern are here.

This area is illuminated.
You see the 1st slightly glowing city guardsman.
Obvious paths: north* south*.
[Northern Avenue.]

A large stone building rises just to the east of Northern Avenue. These barracks house those known as Dread Knights. It is not unusual to see patrols of this elite group heading down the street towards Town Square. One would hope their presence would allow everyone to live in peace. If only they would stop fingering their swords all the time, you might believe it yourself.  A street lantern is here.

This area is illuminated.
Obvious paths: north* south*.
[Northern Avenue.]

Northern Avenue ends at a gateway set within the massive city walls. On the other side of the gate are the Guild Halls. Those who pass through accept the bond of peace that the Guilds impose on all who desire their services. On either side of the gate guards stand at attention saluting all those who pass by.  An open iron gate, an open thick stone door, and a street lantern are here.

This area is illuminated.

The city walls tower high above you at the entrance to the guild district. On top of the wall, a very bored looking guard with a lazy eye watches those passing through the gate. The large guild buildings spread out around the district, bustling with the day-to-day activity of the city's guild groups.  An open iron gate and a street lantern are here.

You see the 1st panhandler and the 2nd panhandler.

The massive building of the Merchant's Guild looms over a vast part of the guild district. The activity at the main door of the guild is mind numbing as hundreds of citizens and merchants alike rush in and out of the guild to handle their business. While the governor has control over the city guard, many claim it is the Merchant's Guild that runs the city of Spur.  An open exquisite polished mahogany door and a street lantern are here.

To the south the road runs back into the center of the city, further to the north the city road continues on toward the other guilds. All the legal city guilds are represented within this city district except for the Forester's Guild. A sign stands beside the road to help direct lost would-be foresters to their guild hall.  A beautiful etched wooden sign and a street lantern are here.

Numerous citizens walk purposefully along the busy street. Fighters and mercenaries make up the majority, but some from almost all walks of life hurry past as well. A dejected street cleaner struggles to keep up with the messes left behind by the pets and other beasts that travel on the roads.  A street lantern is here.

Northern Avenue meets Art Avenue at this intersection. Further to the north, the Mercenary's Guild makes its home, while the Bard's and Sage's Guilds are to the east. The extravagant Merchant's Guild stands to the south. Various sponsors wave pieces of parchment in an attempt to recruit new members.  An open lustrous hammered steel door and a street lantern are here.

The sounds of clashing steel and the calls of battle fill the air near the entrance to the Mercenary's Guild. Numerous hardened warriors lean up against the walls of the building waiting for job offers, while others move in and out of the guild hall going about their daily business. By the looks of it, some of the veterans are giving a barbarian near the front door a hard time.  An open white cedar door and a street lantern are here.

As with everything concerning the Fighters' Guild, this entryway is extremely functional. It is uncluttered by pointless displays, unless you count the fine warriors who are often found loitering within. By the size of those making their ways through the guild hall, it's not likely anything of fine quality put on display would last long without accidentally being knocked over anyway.  An open white cedar door is here.

[Mercenary Guild.]

A large sand pit is watched over by several grizzled veterans. Here the prospective fighter seeks to hone his skills to new heights. Though they use only wooden weapons and shields, occasionally the blows are so loud all those in the guild stop to turn their heads in wonder. For those mercenaries who lack the higher level of schooling, a sign posted nearby explains it all in monosyllables.  A wooden sign, an open drathain bound equipment chest, a drathain trimmed sign, and an open thick white oak door are here.
