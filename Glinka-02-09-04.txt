Maiz says to Tyviel'a, "Seems silly to me that supposedly the best RPers the ones who stage are never seen  again by the young or new dragons."

Mahtina chuckles.

Losmir grins at Maiz.

Maiz says, "We never get to appreciate there skill."

Starlyn says, "I don't see that..."

Mahtina says, "Unless some secian brings you with, that can be fun."

Relawen tickles Starlyn.

Tyviel'a says, "The dragons of that age have chosen that role, to be honest. If Depravato'a does come back more often, I only assume he would be different. It is not a good or by choice, it is acceptable for them to be both ways."

Aliyah says to Maiz, "say yo Sleppy baby, i need to appreciate you some. Lemme see you"

Tyviel'a says, "bad, not by."

Tyviel'a says, "I will say this, however."

Tyviel'a says, "One of my goals taking this position was to offer up more opportunities for them, so they were not pushed into the hills and out of scenarios or game events."

Viator nods.

Tyviel'a says, "I have had mixed results so far, but a lot of that has to do with OOC events."

Maiz asks Tyviel'a, "So it would be perfectly acceptable RP for a third and a few drakes to go hunting?"

Mahtina leans on Midnight.

Tyviel'a asks, "Holidays, people not interested in playing (too late?), etc."

Tyviel'a says to Maiz, "yes, if they chose to do so."

Mahtina says to Tyviel'a, "only a few of us are vampires"

Karon stands up slowly.

Maiz says to Tyviel'a, "I am sure it gets boring for the thirds who chose seclusion."

Starlyn says to Maiz, "Slep hunts whenever he's around... and really he's probably the most active 3rd now, I think"

Ceresina grins at Mahtina warmly.

Mahtina nods up and down to Maiz.

Tyviel'a says, "But it is not BAD for them to ignore all drakes and draco, in favor of seclusion or secian company."

Mahtina nods to Starlyn.

Starlyn says, "Course, I'm not around as much anymore either..."

Aliyah nods to Starlyn.

Starlyn asks, "So maybe I'm missing the other 3rds being in-game?"

Aliyah says, "Lit hasn't been about lately"

Mahtina says to Starlyn, "he is, and he'll take dracos or drakes if we ask."

Aliyah says, "darn FF 11"

Maiz says to Starlyn, "Rarely are they IG"

Jaldis says, "I went hunting with Slep the other day , Ofcourse Charis did drag me "

Aliyah grumbles.

Kiralyn says, "And I'm IG...well, way more than I should be."

Kiralyn shuffles her feet.

Tyviel'a says, "Slep'a is the most active, but none are what I would call active."

Aliyah sniffs.

The calico cat grooms itself.

Tyviel'a asks Maiz, "anything else?"

Karon says, "be well all time to go home"

Tchori asks, "is that still on the table?"

Tyviel'a says to Lilioth, "the game used to be more open on stagings, as some have said. But, I more than understand why some want a private staging. With the lair being closed, and dragons being more hated than in years past, it is a rather dangerous time."

Losmir mutters something beneath his breath.

Tyviel'a asks, "So your question is that true?"

Aliyah says to Tyviel'a, "yes"

Mahtina says to Aliyah, "We were both frustrated with how the bond and empathy were explained."

Viator asks, "Can the Secian half of a bond find a new bond in that case?"

Aliyah asks Tyviel'a, "i mean, why bother to bond if you don't feel something?"

Mahtina says to Viator, "Yes"

Aliyah leans her head on Mahtina's shoulder.

Mandos nods.

Tyviel'a says, "As far as empathy, I do not have any firm, real answers to clue you in on that one. I like how some of you deal with it IG, but I am not sure what you are asking there."

Tyviel'a says, "Let Lumi out of it, just ask me flat out."

Mahtina laughs.

Tyviel'a says, "I will try to give some sort of answer."

Aliyah nods.

Aliyah says to Tyviel'a, "er never mind"

Aliyah nods.

Mahtina says to Tyviel'a, "More of what part does empathy play in the bonding and loss of a bond, or missing bond."

Tyviel'a says, "for years, so not sure that is the right way to answer it."
