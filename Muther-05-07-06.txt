The chipped bark path widens to encompass a broad square between the peaked roofs of the village homes, the larger storefronts, and several communal buildings that all surround a magnificent fountain crafted from local sandstone. The multi-tiered fountain flows with pure, clean springwater and provides seating around its broad base.  The towering trees surround the village, enclosing the square in a living frame.  To the west is a sturdy building with its door perpetually ajar. A line of Leuian children trots off towards the north, bearing their lessons. The faint ding of nautical bells flows in on the breeze from the northwest.   A flowing gold-flecked sandstone fountain is here.

[Village.]

The village homes snuggle closer together as the path nears the town center, and eventually widens to include a few communal buildings and a burbling fountain to the west.  The village bustles with life at all hours. Towering trees spread their branches over the buildings, as if embracing them.    A stack of rocks and an overgrown back alley are here.

[Commodore Island Park.]

A soothing peace has settled over the forest here at the center of the park, where the mists coalesce and then dance back out again amongst the trees. Many small rivulets of water feed into an indent atop a large collection of boulders. As the water overflows the pool, it spills across the sides of the stone to trickle down the steps of the rock formation. Smaller pools are formed as it cascades over the rock until at last the rivulets are reunited into a single small stream which finds its way home to the larger river. Delicate flowering moss has grown over the stones of this centerpiece of the forest, and a small family of larks takes delight in bathing beneath the tiny waterfalls and mossy pools, even as the melodic chirping of other birds wafts through the tree branches all around.  A stack of rocks, a closed door, and a closed dove-etched eagle framed steelwood door are here.

[Commodore Island Park.]

A grove of young, green-needled pine trees surrounds a small meadow of vibrantly flowering rhododendrons. Hues of bright pink, red, and white create a stunning contrast against the darker grey bark of the pines. Brighter green hemlock trees spread to catch the sunlight, which, in turn, shelter smaller stands of delicious salmonberry bushes, airy leather ferns, and poignantly fragranced sorrels that thrive on the compost of the forest floor. Soft haircap moss covers the river stone-lined path, dew from the mist collecting on it like pollen on bees. The distant wash of rushing water quietly filters through the peaceful air that hangs heavily saturated with moisture.  A stack of rocks and a Pride Hall are here.

An enormous circle of smooth oak columns create the walls of the Great Room. From the door, the hard-packed floor descends to a blazing fire pit with aromatic woods such as apple wood, orange and juniper. Fragrant braided sweet-grass mats are placed randomly around the fire pit. Horn sconces bearing beeswax candles emit a soft light, which permeates the room. A simple, yet elegant redwood plaque adorns the far wall. Carved into this plaque is a dedication. A golden flag is prominently displayed against one wall. Mounted above the grand oak door is a leather banner that has "Walk in Honor" branded into it. A Saldaean crafted, walnut weapons case stands in the corner of the room. Various Leuian symbols are hammered into the moonsilver panels adorning the case's doors. A highly polished, maple pantry sits next to the weapons case and bears the mark of the Leuian warrior on each of it's doors.

An enormous circle of smooth oak columns create the walls of the Great Room. From the door, the hard-packed floor descends to a blazing fire pit with aromatic woods such as apple wood, orange and juniper. Fragrant braided sweet-grass mats are placed randomly around the fire pit. Horn sconces bearing beeswax candles emit a soft light, which permeates the room. A simple, yet elegant redwood plaque adorns the far wall. Carved into this plaque is a dedication. A golden flag is prominently displayed against one wall. Mounted above the grand oak door is a leather banner that has "Walk in Honor" branded into it. A Saldaean crafted, walnut weapons case stands in the corner of the room. Various Leuian symbols are hammered into the moonsilver panels adorning the case's doors. A highly polished, maple pantry sits next to the weapons case and bears the mark of the Leuian warrior on each of it's doors.  An open polished maple pantry, an open Leuian crafted oak trunk, an open Saldean crafted walnut weapons case, a redwood plaque, an open leather door, a closed grand oak door, an east corridor, a west corridor, and a golden flag are here.

[The Great Room.]

An enormous circle of smooth oak columns create the walls of the Great Room. From the door, the hard-packed floor descends to a blazing fire pit with aromatic woods such as apple wood, orange and juniper. Fragrant braided sweet-grass mats are placed randomly around the fire pit. Horn sconces bearing beeswax candles emit a soft light, which permeates the room. A simple, yet elegant redwood plaque adorns the far wall. Carved into this plaque is a dedication. A golden flag is prominently displayed against one wall. Mounted above the grand oak door is a leather banner that has "Walk in Honor" branded into it. A Saldaean crafted, walnut weapons case stands in the corner of the room. Various Leuian symbols are hammered into the moonsilver panels adorning the case's doors. A highly polished, maple pantry sits next to the weapons case and bears the mark of the Leuian warrior on each of it's doors.  An open polished maple pantry, an open Leuian crafted oak trunk, an open Saldean crafted walnut weapons case, a redwood plaque, an open leather door, an open grand oak door, an east corridor, a west corridor, a golden flag, some Leuian lobster lasagna, some Leuian lobster lasagna, some Leuian lobster lasagna, and some Leuian lobster lasagna are here.

An enormous circle of smooth oak columns create the walls of the Great Room. From the door, the hard-packed floor descends to a blazing fire pit with aromatic woods such as apple wood, orange and juniper. Fragrant braided sweet-grass mats are placed randomly around the fire pit. Horn sconces bearing beeswax candles emit a soft light, which permeates the room. A simple, yet elegant redwood plaque adorns the far wall. Carved into this plaque is a dedication. A golden flag is prominently displayed against one wall. Mounted above the grand oak door is a leather banner that has "Walk in Honor" branded into it. A Saldaean crafted, walnut weapons case stands in the corner of the room. Various Leuian symbols are hammered into the moonsilver panels adorning the case's doors. A highly polished, maple pantry sits next to the weapons case and bears the mark of the Leuian warrior on each of it's doors.  An open polished maple pantry, an open Leuian crafted oak trunk, an open Saldean crafted walnut weapons case, a redwood plaque, an open leather door, a closed grand oak door, an east corridor, a west corridor, a golden flag, some Leuian lobster lasagna, some Leuian lobster lasagna, some Leuian lobster lasagna, some Leuian lobster lasagna, a fat grilled trout, a fat grilled trout, and a fat grilled trout are here.

[The Great Room.]

An enormous circle of smooth oak columns create the walls of the Great Room. From the door, the hard-packed floor descends to a blazing fire pit with aromatic woods such as apple wood, orange and juniper. Fragrant braided sweet-grass mats are placed randomly around the fire pit. Horn sconces bearing beeswax candles emit a soft light, which permeates the room. A simple, yet elegant redwood plaque adorns the far wall. Carved into this plaque is a dedication. A golden flag is prominently displayed against one wall. Mounted above the grand oak door is a leather banner that has "Walk in Honor" branded into it. A Saldaean crafted, walnut weapons case stands in the corner of the room. Various Leuian symbols are hammered into the moonsilver panels adorning the case's doors. A highly polished, maple pantry sits next to the weapons case and bears the mark of the Leuian warrior on each of it's doors.  An open polished maple pantry, an open Leuian crafted oak trunk, an open Saldean crafted walnut weapons case, a redwood plaque, an open leather door, a closed grand oak door, an east corridor, a west corridor, a golden flag, some Leuian lobster lasagna, some Leuian lobster lasagna, some Leuian lobster lasagna, some Leuian lobster lasagna, a fat grilled trout, a fat grilled trout, and a fat grilled trout are here.

An enormous circle of smooth oak columns create the walls of the Great Room. From the door, the hard-packed floor descends to a blazing fire pit with aromatic woods such as apple wood, orange and juniper. Fragrant braided sweet-grass mats are placed randomly around the fire pit. Horn sconces bearing beeswax candles emit a soft light, which permeates the room. A simple, yet elegant redwood plaque adorns the far wall. Carved into this plaque is a dedication. A golden flag is prominently displayed against one wall. Mounted above the grand oak door is a leather banner that has "Walk in Honor" branded into it. A Saldaean crafted, walnut weapons case stands in the corner of the room. Various Leuian symbols are hammered into the moonsilver panels adorning the case's doors. A highly polished, maple pantry sits next to the weapons case and bears the mark of the Leuian warrior on each of it's doors.  An open polished maple pantry, an open Leuian crafted oak trunk, an open Saldean crafted walnut weapons case, a redwood plaque, an open leather door, a closed grand oak door, an east corridor, a west corridor, a golden flag, some Leuian lobster lasagna, some Leuian lobster lasagna, some Leuian lobster lasagna, some Leuian lobster lasagna, a fat grilled trout, a fat grilled trout, a fat grilled trout, and a fat grilled trout are here.

[The Secluded Garden.]

Plush, green grass covers the ground.

                                    Visualization #1 is:
Through the gate lies the city of Spur, the major center of trade and civilization on the plains. The dusty road leading through the gates is well traveled, and walls of the city are in good repair. A small shack sits to the west of the road, during most times of the day a dusty coach can be seen waiting in front, its horses stomping with impatience to be gone. To the right of the door is a small window, its opening covered with metal bars. An old man, missing most of his teeth, waits patiently for the travelers to pay their fare, and then directs them into the waiting area. On the east side of the road a billowing multicolored tent has been erected, the hustle and bustle of merchants and customers can be seen coming and going at all times of the day.

                                    Visualization #2 is:
Each corner of this square gives entrance to one of the fort's four business establishments. The bank is small, but adequate. The pawnshop and store will see to your buying and selling needs, and the Tarath Wayside Inn is open at all hours to provide shelter for residents and foreigners alike.

                                    Visualization #3 is:
Carefully winding its way up the base of the tree, and wrapping itself around the stairs, a flowering jasmine vine grows tall and lush. Dark scars from a past fire are almost hidden under tufts of fresh growth and moss. A large gap, nearly sixteen feet in distance, rests between the base of a set of stairs and the forest floor. A long moonsilver cord hangs down the side of the tree. If one pulls it, the long Elven rope will descend from above, allowing them to enter the great city of Treehaven. Bright green leaves of clover have begun springing up through the ashy soil in conjunction with soft moss to lend a durable cushion to this well-traveled spot.

[The Great Room.]

An enormous circle of smooth oak columns create the walls of the Great Room. From the door, the hard-packed floor descends to a blazing fire pit with aromatic woods such as apple wood, orange and juniper. Fragrant braided sweet-grass mats are placed randomly around the fire pit. Horn sconces bearing beeswax candles emit a soft light, which permeates the room. A simple, yet elegant redwood plaque adorns the far wall. Carved into this plaque is a dedication. A golden flag is prominently displayed against one wall. Mounted above the grand oak door is a leather banner that has "Walk in Honor" branded into it. A Saldaean crafted, walnut weapons case stands in the corner of the room. Various Leuian symbols are hammered into the moonsilver panels adorning the case's doors. A highly polished, maple pantry sits next to the weapons case and bears the mark of the Leuian warrior on each of it's doors.  An open polished maple pantry, an open Leuian crafted oak trunk, an open Saldean crafted walnut weapons case, a redwood plaque, an open leather door, a closed grand oak door, an east corridor, a west corridor, and a golden flag are here.

This room is illuminated.

Brighter green hemlock trees spread to catch the sunlight, which, in turn, shelter smaller stands of delicious salmonberry bushes, airy leather ferns, and poignantly fragranced sorrels that thrive on the compost of the forest floor. Soft haircap moss covers the river stone-lined path, dew from the mist collecting on it like pollen on bees. The distant wash of rushing water quietly filters through the peaceful air that hangs heavily saturated with moisture.  A stack of rocks and a Pride Hall are here.

[Commodore Island Park.]

A soothing peace has settled over the forest here at the center of the park, where the mists coalesce and then dance back out again amongst the trees. Many small rivulets of water feed into an indent atop a large collection of boulders. As the water overflows the pool, it spills across the sides of the stone to trickle down the steps of the rock formation. Smaller pools are formed as it cascades over the rock until at last the rivulets are reunited into a single small stream which finds its way home to the larger river. Delicate flowering moss has grown over the stones of this centerpiece of the forest, and a small family of larks takes delight in bathing beneath the tiny waterfalls and mossy pools, even as the melodic chirping of other birds wafts through the tree branches all around.  A stack of rocks, a closed door, and a closed dove-etched eagle framed steelwood door are here.

[Village.]

Far above the forest floor, the looming trees' canopy shades the park's paths. Every few feet a break in the leaves lights a fortunate fern or clover patch that languishes in the gift from the heavens. A giant among oaks, dwarfed by the mighty conifers enjoys such a boon.  Its twisted branches decry the battle to survive beneath the taller competitors. Nestled in the crotches of the oak branches, beautiful orchids thrive and bloom despite the weather, causing many of the villagers to believe that the goddess herself has adopted the oak as one of her protected monuments. The villagers have placed benches made of koy around the oak that complement the park without detracting from its natural beauty.  An ancient gnarled oak tree, some fragrant amber orchids, a beautiful hand-carved koy wood bench, a stack of rocks, and an ivy covered sandstone arch are here.

[Commodore Island Park.]

Under the canopy of the huge trees, the cooling peace of the forest mists continues to caress the earth amongst the sweeping fern leaves. Two immense redwood trees, grandfathers to their smaller brethren, stand as silent guardians at the entrance to a natural park. The giants are marked by great rents from limbs lost in mighty winds and scars from both fire and mortal carelessness; yet the ancient trees bear these scars like honored badges, a testament to the vast history of this forest. The limbs of the grandfather conifers cross in a beautiful but simple arch over the path between the trees leading into the park.  A pair of tall ancient redwood trees, a stack of rocks, some beautiful pure white snow drop flowers, and an open wrought iron gate are here.

The churning waters of the Darkith continue their journey to the ocean beyond the protection of the rocky breakwater to the east.  A small safe harbor sits unflaggingly in the resulting eddy, bolstered by the sand and silt erosion of the Great Divide far beyond the horizon, to the Northeast.  A tidy village hugs the river's edge taking full advantage of the lush island growth and natural haven.  A smooth stone tunnel and a stack of rocks are here.

[Commodore Island Park.]

A worn rock cliff-face juts out from the island's hillside, its worn edges descending steeply until it finally dives down into the depths of the river.  The river's current boils angrily against the staunch rocks, working to tear their very existence into pebbles and sand.  A smooth tunnel paved with flat stones and supported by solid wooden beams cuts through the cliff.  A smooth dark stone tunnel, a Hithual crafted oak barrel, and a huge pile of dirt are here.

Sand, debris, rocks, and finally soil deposited by the Darkith river over thousands of years have piled against a natural rock barrier to create an inter-river island.  The course of the mighty Darkith has altered slightly to accomodate the building bulk of the island and now flows on both sides.  Rapids sluice on the east and west side of this island, filling the air with a damp mist that sits heavily on the countryside.  A floating pontoon bridge, some cut green branches, and a large brush pile are here.

Shuddering and shifting under the weight of all but the smallest travelers, this floating bridge plies the churning dark waters of the Darkith with ponderous grace. Thick hand sawed planks are tied together with huge twisted hemp ropes and cushioned with rubber bumpers to ease the constant ebb of the river's flow.  Each tar-coated plank moves independantly of the others, causing serpentine twists in the bridge's original shape.

A closed large sturdy wooden gate, a stone bridge, and some leafy branches and trees are here.

Here a gate leads out of the fort and into the Southern regions. Several children run and play just inside the gate, under the watchful eyes of the guards. What was once a very well used trade route has slowed to some caravans bringing supplies for the townsmen and the occasional merchants traveling from the far southern reaches of the land. Many guards protect this section of the fort as it is home to some wild beasts that live outside these walls. In the distance, you can make out two more guards hunting the frogmen that often try to attack the city and caravans.  An open large sturdy wooden gate, a glowing wrought iron lantern, and a fluffy white layer of snow are here.

Within the heart of this proud fort one can see all around that the reconstruction of its buildings has begun. Large stones and logs have been stacked and piled, while some workers tirelessly attempt to repair the damage that occurred here during the Lords of Chaos wars. The buildings and homes of the people that resided here are slowly taking shape, though, far from completed. The smell of dyes, used to paint the town, permeate the area.

Thick and long wooden ladders serve up to the guard's posts high in the sky so that they may have some relief from their duties overlooking the land and city. Through the slates of the wooden walkways, you can make out four archers playing a game of cards, weapons at the ready. A whip cracks loudly as a caravan heads out the gate towards Spur.

The dark mist continues to surround you. Long agonizing moans echo around your ears, making it difficult for you to even think clearly. To the east, you can just barely make out the dim outline of the ship's broken mast.

You follow Hott south...

[The Siren, Stern]

Dark, murky waves smash rhythmically against the back of the Siren, splashing foul liquid across the deck. Dark, threatening clouds hang straight overhead. You can think of many places where you'd rather be right now.

You follow Hott east...

[The Siren, Stern]

You see dark, vile water surging below you as you look over the ship's railing. Suddenly, visions of hundreds of contorted faces melt in and out of existence in the murky water. You try with all your might to avert your eyes, but the gruesome spectacle etches itself indelibly in your memory.  A broken mast is here.

[The Siren, Stern]

As you make your way through the rolling mist, you notice a dark hole in the ship's deck just seconds before it's too late. You can't see much in the darkness through the hole, but you can tell it must be quite a long drop to the bottom.  A dark hole is here.

You follow Hott north...

[The Siren]

The occasional blood-curdling scream shatters the silence as you make your way along the starboard side of the decrepit ship. To your east, you see something take shape over the water. Through the dense fog you make out the outlines of a face. At first it views you with curiosity, then its expression quickly turns to one of anger. It then fades away as quickly as it appeared.

[The Siren]

You stand shivering at the center of the long forgotten ship.  The icy winds encompassing The Siren freeze you to the core. The rotted center mast rises up into the mist here, flanked by two smaller ones to the north and south of you.  A rotting mast is here.

You follow Hott north...

[The Siren]

Debris lies scattered around the deck, making the trek across the ship a treacherous one. The mast has been smashed in two, leaving jagged splinters in your path. Moans and cries of agony echo from beyond the stairway leading below deck.  A broken mast and a stairway are here.

The deck of the Siren lies in ruin. Rotted and broken planks cover the deck, making it tricky to move around. A dark fog envelops the ship, and a chilling breeze sends shivers up your spine.  A broken plank is here.

The siren's bow has seen better days. The ship's figurehead, at one time representing a beautiful woman adorned with jewels, now lies in ruin. It has rotted to the point where it could fall into the ocean at any moment.  A broken rotting figurehead is here.

[The Siren]

The deck of the Siren lies in ruin. Rotted and broken planks cover the deck, making it tricky to move around. A dark fog envelops the ship, and a chilling breeze sends shivers up your spine.  A broken plank, a gold coin, some silver coins, a bone handled bronze morning star, some stale dry crusts of bread, a heavy leather strapped burlap armor, and some spicy brown gingerbread are here.

This area is illuminated.
In the area are Kendre the Novice Leuian, Hott the Noble Leuian, Vitani the Noble Leuian, Leanne the Noble Leuian, and Pantherro the Leuian.
Obvious paths: east* south* southwest* west* northwest*.

[The Siren]

Debris lies scattered around the deck, making the trek across the ship a treacherous one. The mast has been smashed in two, leaving jagged splinters in your path. Moans and cries of agony echo from beyond the stairway leading below deck.  A broken mast and a stairway are here.

This area is illuminated.
You see the 1st moaning spirit and the 2nd moaning spirit.
In the area are Kendre the Novice Leuian, Hott the Noble Leuian, Vitani the Noble Leuian, Leanne the Noble Leuian, and Pantherro the Leuian.
Obvious paths: north* east* southeast* south* southwest* west*.

As you make your way through the rolling mist, you notice a dark hole in the ship's deck just seconds before it's too late. You can't see much in the darkness through the hole, but you can tell it must be quite a long drop to the bottom.  A dark hole is here.

You see Leanne call out the name of Rinanni and point at the tortured spirit!

The tortured spirit ignores the attempt to turn it!
You see Pantherro move up another 1 UDs!

The tortured spirit suddenly takes on a very wild-eyed look!

The tortured spirit turns and runs south!

You follow Hott south...

[The Siren, Hallway]

The dark, foul smelling hall abruptly branches out to the east towards the ship's galley and west towards the crew's quarters. Out of the corner of your eye, you see small, thin, worm-like creatures darting in and out of the shadows. An old iron grate lies under your feet. Its lock has long since rusted off.  An open rusted iron grate is here.

This area is not illuminated.
You see the 1st tortured spirit.
In the area are Kendre the Novice Leuian, Hott the Noble Leuian, Vitani the Noble Leuian, Leanne the Noble Leuian, and Pantherro the Leuian.
Obvious paths: north east west.
