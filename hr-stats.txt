The tangy-sweet smell of metal and leather permeate the air of this shop. A stout Hithual wearing a leather apron barks an order to a young apprentice who lets out a yelp and rushes to the back of the shop to carry out his master's wishes. The shopkeeper mumbles about lazy youngsters and returns to oiling a fine looking leather weapon harness, leaving you to examine his wares on your own.   Some glowing quartz faced copper lanterns and a closed polished oak door are here.

This room is illuminated.
Obvious exits: None.
