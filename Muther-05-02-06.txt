The chipped bark path widens to encompass a broad square between the peaked roofs of the village homes, the larger storefronts, and several communal buildings that all surround a magnificent fountain crafted from local sandstone. The multi-tiered fountain flows with pure, clean springwater and provides seating around its broad base.  The towering trees surround the village, enclosing the square in a living frame.  To the west is a sturdy building with its door perpetually ajar. A line of Leuian children trots off towards the north, bearing their lessons. The faint ding of nautical bells flows in on the breeze from the northwest.   A flowing gold-flecked sandstone fountain is here.

This area is illuminated.
You see the 1st playful short-legged pony (wearing a small gold collar).

[Village.]

The chipped bark path widens to encompass a broad square between the peaked roofs of the village homes, the larger storefronts, and several communal buildings that all surround a magnificent fountain crafted from local sandstone. The multi-tiered fountain flows with pure, clean springwater and provides seating around its broad base.  The towering trees surround the village, enclosing the square in a living frame.  To the west is a sturdy building with its door perpetually ajar. A line of Leuian children trots off towards the north, bearing their lessons. The faint ding of nautical bells flows in on the breeze from the northwest.   A flowing gold-flecked sandstone fountain is here.

This area is illuminated.
You see the 1st young clouded leopard (wearing a small gold collar) and the 1st playful short-legged pony (wearing a small gold collar).

A closed chiseled petrified redwood door, a closed arched slate grey granite boulder door, a closed salt stained cargo hatch, a closed vine etched glass door, and a decaying pile of planks are here.

A grove of young, green-needled pine trees surrounds a small meadow of vibrantly flowering rhododendrons. Hues of bright pink, red, and white create a stunning contrast against the darker grey bark of the pines. Brighter green hemlock trees spread to catch the sunlight, which, in turn, shelter smaller stands of delicious salmonberry bushes, airy leather ferns, and poignantly fragranced sorrels that thrive on the compost of the forest floor. Soft haircap moss covers the river stone-lined path, dew from the mist collecting on it like pollen on bees. The distant wash of rushing water quietly filters through the peaceful air that hangs heavily saturated with moisture.  A stack of rocks and a Pride Hall are here.

[Commodore Island Park.]

A grove of young, green-needled pine trees surrounds a small meadow of vibrantly flowering rhododendrons. Hues of bright pink, red, and white create a stunning contrast against the darker grey bark of the pines. Brighter green hemlock trees spread to catch the sunlight, which, in turn, shelter smaller stands of delicious salmonberry bushes, airy leather ferns, and poignantly fragranced sorrels that thrive on the compost of the forest floor. Soft haircap moss covers the river stone-lined path, dew from the mist collecting on it like pollen on bees. The distant wash of rushing water quietly filters through the peaceful air that hangs heavily saturated with moisture.  A stack of rocks and a Pride Hall are here.

[The Great Room.]

An enormous circle of smooth oak columns create the walls of the Great Room. From the door, the hard-packed floor descends to a blazing fire pit with aromatic woods such as apple wood, orange and juniper. Fragrant braided sweet-grass mats are placed randomly around the fire pit. Horn sconces bearing beeswax candles emit a soft light, which permeates the room. A simple, yet elegant redwood plaque adorns the far wall. Carved into this plaque is a dedication. A golden flag is prominently displayed against one wall. Mounted above the grand oak door is a leather banner that has "Walk in Honor" branded into it. A Saldaean crafted, walnut weapons case stands in the corner of the room. Various Leuian symbols are hammered into the moonsilver panels adorning the case's doors. A highly polished, maple pantry sits next to the weapons case and bears the mark of the Leuian warrior on each of it's doors.  An open polished maple pantry, an open Leuian crafted oak trunk, an open Saldean crafted walnut weapons case, a redwood plaque, an open leather door, an open grand oak door, an east corridor, a west corridor, and a golden flag are here.

[The Secluded Garden.]

Plush, green grass covers the ground. A small babbling brook rises suddenly from the ground then runs through the clearing flowing over smooth stones creating a miniature waterfall which then drains back into the earth. A large garden with rows of vegetables is surrounded by a radiant flowerbed bursting in a riot of colors. Claw footed oak benches are sporadically placed around the garden and brook. Large trees, as tall as the surrounding building, create a canopy for the clearing allowing small rays of sun, as well as, tiny portals to view the twinkling stars with a stunning view of Rinanni's Circle of Promise. On each side of the garden, almost hidden by the dense foliage of the trees, are two grand deep mahogany tufted leather doors etched with the Pride's symbol.  A babbling brook, a small granite cenotaph, a closed cellar door, an open leather door, and an open leather door are here.

[The Great Room.]

An enormous circle of smooth oak columns create the walls of the Great Room. From the door, the hard-packed floor descends to a blazing fire pit with aromatic woods such as apple wood, orange and juniper. Fragrant braided sweet-grass mats are placed randomly around the fire pit. Horn sconces bearing beeswax candles emit a soft light, which permeates the room. A simple, yet elegant redwood plaque adorns the far wall. Carved into this plaque is a dedication. A golden flag is prominently displayed against one wall. Mounted above the grand oak door is a leather banner that has "Walk in Honor" branded into it. A Saldaean crafted, walnut weapons case stands in the corner of the room. Various Leuian symbols are hammered into the moonsilver panels adorning the case's doors. A highly polished, maple pantry sits next to the weapons case and bears the mark of the Leuian warrior on each of it's doors.  An open polished maple pantry, an open Leuian crafted oak trunk, an open Saldean crafted walnut weapons case, a redwood plaque, an open leather door, a closed grand oak door, an east corridor, a west corridor, and a golden flag are here.

This room is illuminated.

Pantherro says in Leuian, "Having a central room and five for the gods leaves me two rooms to fill up. I thought the memorial garden would fit in better there."

The playful short-legged pony paces nervously.

Runningdeer says in Leuian, "some time back, Tchori asked me to design three spaces for a ...well pyre...sort of thing...for the final journey...thought we could incorporate that as well into one of the rooms"

Shaleu says in Leuian, "did you want to have this as part of the Pride Hall or built where the Rinanni shrine is now"

[The Secluded Garden.]

Plush, green grass covers the ground. A small babbling brook rises suddenly from the ground then runs through the clearing flowing over smooth stones creating a miniature waterfall which then drains back into the earth. A large garden with rows of vegetables is surrounded by a radiant flowerbed bursting in a riot of colors. Claw footed oak benches are sporadically placed around the garden and brook. Large trees, as tall as the surrounding building, create a canopy for the clearing allowing small rays of sun, as well as, tiny portals to view the twinkling stars with a stunning view of Rinanni's Circle of Promise. On each side of the garden, almost hidden by the dense foliage of the trees, are two grand deep mahogany tufted leather doors etched with the Pride's symbol.  A babbling brook, a small granite cenotaph, an open cellar door, an open leather door, and an open leather door are here.

>[The Great Room.]

An enormous circle of smooth oak columns create the walls of the Great Room. From the door, the hard-packed floor descends to a blazing fire pit with aromatic woods such as apple wood, orange and juniper. Fragrant braided sweet-grass mats are placed randomly around the fire pit. Horn sconces bearing beeswax candles emit a soft light, which permeates the room. A simple, yet elegant redwood plaque adorns the far wall. Carved into this plaque is a dedication. A golden flag is prominently displayed against one wall. Mounted above the grand oak door is a leather banner that has "Walk in Honor" branded into it. A Saldaean crafted, walnut weapons case stands in the corner of the room. Various Leuian symbols are hammered into the moonsilver panels adorning the case's doors. A highly polished, maple pantry sits next to the weapons case and bears the mark of the Leuian warrior on each of it's doors.  An open polished maple pantry, an open Leuian crafted oak trunk, an open Saldean crafted walnut weapons case, a redwood plaque, an open leather door, a closed grand oak door, an east corridor, a west corridor, and a golden flag are here.

A highly polished, maple pantry sits next to the weapons case and bears the mark of the Leuian warrior on each of it's doors.  An open polished maple pantry, an open Leuian crafted oak trunk, an open Saldean crafted walnut weapons case, a redwood plaque, an open leather door, a closed grand oak door, an east corridor, a west corridor, and a golden flag are here.

This room is illuminated.

A grove of young, green-needled pine trees surrounds a small meadow of vibrantly flowering rhododendrons. Hues of bright pink, red, and white create a stunning contrast against the darker grey bark of the pines. Brighter green hemlock trees spread to catch the sunlight, which, in turn, shelter smaller stands of delicious salmonberry bushes, airy leather ferns, and poignantly fragranced sorrels that thrive on the compost of the forest floor. Soft haircap moss covers the river stone-lined path, dew from the mist collecting on it like pollen on bees. The distant wash of rushing water quietly filters through the peaceful air that hangs heavily saturated with moisture.  A stack of rocks and a Pride Hall are here.

Amidst the towering trees and verdant mid level bushes, several smaller cabins blend into the surrounding park. The peaked roofs of the cabins bear the familiar carving as seen on most of the village homes and their small porches sport plantings of flowering wild roses and perky daisies accented with the fronds of leather ferns and shelf fungus.  A closed chiseled petrified redwood door, a closed arched slate grey granite boulder door, a closed salt stained cargo hatch, a closed vine etched glass door, and a decaying pile of planks are here.

The village homes snuggle closer together as the path nears the town center, and eventually widens to include a few communal buildings and a burbling fountain to the west.  The village bustles with life at all hours. Towering trees spread their branches over the buildings, as if embracing them.    A stack of rocks and an overgrown back alley are here.

The chipped bark path widens to encompass a broad square between the peaked roofs of the village homes, the larger storefronts, and several communal buildings that all surround a magnificent fountain crafted from local sandstone. The multi-tiered fountain flows with pure, clean springwater and provides seating around its broad base.  The towering trees surround the village, enclosing the square in a living frame.  To the west is a sturdy building with its door perpetually ajar. A line of Leuian children trots off towards the north, bearing their lessons. The faint ding of nautical bells flows in on the breeze from the northwest.   A flowing gold-flecked sandstone fountain is here.

An immense, smoothed river boulder deposited by the river, eons ago, is imbedded in the soft loam of the forest floor and blocks the view of the river to the north. A few giant trees have grown bent around its rounded shape and an innovative homeowner has taken advantage of the resulting shelter. Built carefully among the trees in the lee of the rock, stands a magnificent example of the same peaked wooden beam homes that dot the entire forest. One fledgling tree pokes its head through a well-planned hole in the roof.  A pair of closed magnificent carved steelwood doors, a slippery downhill path, and a stack of rocks are here.

[Village.]

The chipped bark path widens to encompass a broad square between the peaked roofs of the village homes, the larger storefronts, and several communal buildings that all surround a magnificent fountain crafted from local sandstone. The multi-tiered fountain flows with pure, clean springwater and provides seating around its broad base.  The towering trees surround the village, enclosing the square in a living frame.  To the west is a sturdy building with its door perpetually ajar. A line of Leuian children trots off towards the north, bearing their lessons. The faint ding of nautical bells flows in on the breeze from the northwest.   A flowing gold-flecked sandstone fountain is here.

The village homes snuggle closer together as the path nears the town center, and eventually widens to include a few communal buildings and a burbling fountain to the west.  The village bustles with life at all hours. Towering trees spread their branches over the buildings, as if embracing them.    A stack of rocks and an overgrown back alley are here.

Amidst the towering trees and verdant mid level bushes, several smaller cabins blend into the surrounding park. The peaked roofs of the cabins bear the familiar carving as seen on most of the village homes and their small porches sport plantings of flowering wild roses and perky daisies accented with the fronds of leather ferns and shelf fungus.  A closed chiseled petrified redwood door, a closed arched slate grey granite boulder door, a closed salt stained cargo hatch, a closed vine etched glass door, and a decaying pile of planks are here.

A grove of young, green-needled pine trees surrounds a small meadow of vibrantly flowering rhododendrons. Hues of bright pink, red, and white create a stunning contrast against the darker grey bark of the pines. Brighter green hemlock trees spread to catch the sunlight, which, in turn, shelter smaller stands of delicious salmonberry bushes, airy leather ferns, and poignantly fragranced sorrels that thrive on the compost of the forest floor. Soft haircap moss covers the river stone-lined path, dew from the mist collecting on it like pollen on bees. The distant wash of rushing water quietly filters through the peaceful air that hangs heavily saturated with moisture.  A stack of rocks and a Pride Hall are here.

[The Great Room.]

An enormous circle of smooth oak columns create the walls of the Great Room. From the door, the hard-packed floor descends to a blazing fire pit with aromatic woods such as apple wood, orange and juniper. Fragrant braided sweet-grass mats are placed randomly around the fire pit. Horn sconces bearing beeswax candles emit a soft light, which permeates the room. A simple, yet elegant redwood plaque adorns the far wall. Carved into this plaque is a dedication. A golden flag is prominently displayed against one wall. Mounted above the grand oak door is a leather banner that has "Walk in Honor" branded into it. A Saldaean crafted, walnut weapons case stands in the corner of the room. Various Leuian symbols are hammered into the moonsilver panels adorning the case's doors. A highly polished, maple pantry sits next to the weapons case and bears the mark of the Leuian warrior on each of it's doors.  An open polished maple pantry, an open Leuian crafted oak trunk, an open Saldean crafted walnut weapons case, a redwood plaque, an open leather door, an open grand oak door, an east corridor, a west corridor, and a golden flag are here.

[Commodore Island Park.]

A grove of young, green-needled pine trees surrounds a small meadow of vibrantly flowering rhododendrons. Hues of bright pink, red, and white create a stunning contrast against the darker grey bark of the pines. Brighter green hemlock trees spread to catch the sunlight, which, in turn, shelter smaller stands of delicious salmonberry bushes, airy leather ferns, and poignantly fragranced sorrels that thrive on the compost of the forest floor. Soft haircap moss covers the river stone-lined path, dew from the mist collecting on it like pollen on bees. The distant wash of rushing water quietly filters through the peaceful air that hangs heavily saturated with moisture.  A stack of rocks and a Pride Hall are here.

An enormous circle of smooth oak columns create the walls of the Great Room. From the door, the hard-packed floor descends to a blazing fire pit with aromatic woods such as apple wood, orange and juniper. Fragrant braided sweet-grass mats are placed randomly around the fire pit. Horn sconces bearing beeswax candles emit a soft light, which permeates the room. A simple, yet elegant redwood plaque adorns the far wall. Carved into this plaque is a dedication. A golden flag is prominently displayed against one wall. Mounted above the grand oak door is a leather banner that has "Walk in Honor" branded into it. A Saldaean crafted, walnut weapons case stands in the corner of the room. Various Leuian symbols are hammered into the moonsilver panels adorning the case's doors. A highly polished, maple pantry sits next to the weapons case and bears the mark of the Leuian warrior on each of it's doors.

Through the gate lies the city of Spur, the major center of trade and civilization on the plains. The dusty road leading through the gates is well traveled, and walls of the city are in good repair. A small shack sits to the west of the road, during most times of the day a dusty coach can be seen waiting in front, its horses stomping with impatience to be gone. To the right of the door is a small window, its opening covered with metal bars. An old man, missing most of his teeth, waits patiently for the travelers to pay their fare, and then directs them into the waiting area. On the east side of the road a billowing multicolored tent has been erected, the hustle and bustle of merchants and customers can be seen coming and going at all times of the day.

                                    Visualization #2 is:
Each corner of this square gives entrance to one of the fort's four business establishments. The bank is small, but adequate. The pawnshop and store will see to your buying and selling needs, and the Tarath Wayside Inn is open at all hours to provide shelter for residents and foreigners alike.

                                    Visualization #3 is:
Carefully winding its way up the base of the tree, and wrapping itself around the stairs, a flowering jasmine vine grows tall and lush. Dark scars from a past fire are almost hidden under tufts of fresh growth and moss. A large gap, nearly sixteen feet in distance, rests between the base of a set of stairs and the forest floor. A long moonsilver cord hangs down the side of the tree. If one pulls it, the long Elven rope will descend from above, allowing them to enter the great city of Treehaven. Bright green leaves of clover have begun springing up through the ashy soil in conjunction with soft moss to lend a durable cushion to this well-traveled spot.

[The Great Room.]

An enormous circle of smooth oak columns create the walls of the Great Room. From the door, the hard-packed floor descends to a blazing fire pit with aromatic woods such as apple wood, orange and juniper. Fragrant braided sweet-grass mats are placed randomly around the fire pit. Horn sconces bearing beeswax candles emit a soft light, which permeates the room. A simple, yet elegant redwood plaque adorns the far wall. Carved into this plaque is a dedication. A golden flag is prominently displayed against one wall. Mounted above the grand oak door is a leather banner that has "Walk in Honor" branded into it. A Saldaean crafted, walnut weapons case stands in the corner of the room. Various Leuian symbols are hammered into the moonsilver panels adorning the case's doors. A highly polished, maple pantry sits next to the weapons case and bears the mark of the Leuian warrior on each of it's doors.  An open polished maple pantry, an open Leuian crafted oak trunk, an open Saldean crafted walnut weapons case, a redwood plaque, an open leather door, a closed grand oak door, an east corridor, a west corridor, a golden flag, some Leuian lobster lasagna, and some Leuian lobster lasagna are here.

A grove of young, green-needled pine trees surrounds a small meadow of vibrantly flowering rhododendrons. Hues of bright pink, red, and white create a stunning contrast against the darker grey bark of the pines. Brighter green hemlock trees spread to catch the sunlight, which, in turn, shelter smaller stands of delicious salmonberry bushes, airy leather ferns, and poignantly fragranced sorrels that thrive on the compost of the forest floor. Soft haircap moss covers the river stone-lined path, dew from the mist collecting on it like pollen on bees. The distant wash of rushing water quietly filters through the peaceful air that hangs heavily saturated with moisture.  A stack of rocks and a Pride Hall are here.

A grove of young, green-needled pine trees surrounds a small meadow of vibrantly flowering rhododendrons. Hues of bright pink, red, and white create a stunning contrast against the darker grey bark of the pines. Brighter green hemlock trees spread to catch the sunlight, which, in turn, shelter smaller stands of delicious salmonberry bushes, airy leather ferns, and poignantly fragranced sorrels that thrive on the compost of the forest floor. Soft haircap moss covers the river stone-lined path, dew from the mist collecting on it like pollen on bees. The distant wash of rushing water quietly filters through the peaceful air that hangs heavily saturated with moisture.  A stack of rocks and a Pride Hall are here.

An enormous circle of smooth oak columns create the walls of the Great Room. From the door, the hard-packed floor descends to a blazing fire pit with aromatic woods such as apple wood, orange and juniper. Fragrant braided sweet-grass mats are placed randomly around the fire pit. Horn sconces bearing beeswax candles emit a soft light, which permeates the room. A simple, yet elegant redwood plaque adorns the far wall. Carved into this plaque is a dedication. A golden flag is prominently displayed against one wall. Mounted above the grand oak door is a leather banner that has "Walk in Honor" branded into it. A Saldaean crafted, walnut weapons case stands in the corner of the room. Various Leuian symbols are hammered into the moonsilver panels adorning the case's doors. A highly polished, maple pantry sits next to the weapons case and bears the mark of the Leuian warrior on each of it's doors.  An open polished maple pantry, an open Leuian crafted oak trunk, an open Saldean crafted walnut weapons case, a redwood plaque, an open leather door, a closed grand oak door, an east corridor, a west corridor, a golden flag, some Leuian lobster lasagna, and some Leuian lobster lasagna are here.

A grove of young, green-needled pine trees surrounds a small meadow of vibrantly flowering rhododendrons. Hues of bright pink, red, and white create a stunning contrast against the darker grey bark of the pines. Brighter green hemlock trees spread to catch the sunlight, which, in turn, shelter smaller stands of delicious salmonberry bushes, airy leather ferns, and poignantly fragranced sorrels that thrive on the compost of the forest floor. Soft haircap moss covers the river stone-lined path, dew from the mist collecting on it like pollen on bees. The distant wash of rushing water quietly filters through the peaceful air that hangs heavily saturated with moisture.  A stack of rocks and a Pride Hall are here.

A soothing peace has settled over the forest here at the center of the park, where the mists coalesce and then dance back out again amongst the trees. Many small rivulets of water feed into an indent atop a large collection of boulders. As the water overflows the pool, it spills across the sides of the stone to trickle down the steps of the rock formation. Smaller pools are formed as it cascades over the rock until at last the rivulets are reunited into a single small stream which finds its way home to the larger river. Delicate flowering moss has grown over the stones of this centerpiece of the forest, and a small family of larks takes delight in bathing beneath the tiny waterfalls and mossy pools, even as the melodic chirping of other birds wafts through the tree branches all around.  A stack of rocks, a closed door, and a closed dove-etched eagle framed steelwood door are here.

The bark-strewn path carefully circumvents the delicate roots of the giant trees that border the park. The tittering of birds and the scampering of squirrels is muffled by the thick layer of pine needles that pad the forest floor. The sounds of foot traffic and voices from the surrounding homes do not penetrate the tranquil forest despite the fact that life in the village continues outside.  A stack of rocks and a delicately carved crystal shrine of Rinanni are here.

Whether erected strictly for entrepreneurial reasons or as a tribute to the art of carving, a master craftsman has turned one of the lightning struck dead-fall timbers into an impressive sign-post directing all to his place of business as well as the other services available in the village.  Small, discreet arrows point west and southwest with directions written in Leuian.  All available spaces between the directions are filled with exquisite carvings of great antlered deer, growling, shaggy bears, breaching barnacle-backed whales, pointy-eared rabbits, and heavy maned horses, and the noble Leuian warriors among them.  The animals bear no marks of ownership, harness, or muzzle, and none are contained in fences. Displayed on the lower half, a few feet off the ground is a carving of a wolf-size, panting dog enjoying a scratch from the Leuian's hands.  A detailed hand-carved monument, a closed blackened oak gate, and a stack of rocks are here.

Snuggled against the shelter of the cliff, two homes occupy the corner of the forest, bordered by the bark path.  The homes are almost identical, except for slight differences in the carving.  Each has a well tended garden complete with straight, neat rows and a brightly dressed scarecrow.  Each has a lush hand-trimmed lawn. Between the two yards, a magnificent tulip tree thrives and shades both homes easily. Its rosy blooms shed constantly to apply a thick carpet of flower petals upon the lawns. Planted firmly beneath the beautiful tree is a sturdy wooden table with a set of comfy high backed chairs, treated to keep the moisture out. Two nearly identical gnarled Leuian veterans sit across from each other enthralled in a game involving a series of small bowls of river-smoothed stones. Hours pass as they eye each other until one finally moves and the strategizing begins anew.  A stack of rocks and a closed razorbush gate are here.

The fragrant bark path meanders through several small yards otherwise carpeted with verdant grass trimmed meticulously to within an inch of the ground. Vibrant wildflowers populate the skillfully tamed native bushes that border each yard. A grey-maned Leuian stands half bent-over tending a miniature cypress tree with hand shears. He snips one branch on one side and stands back to admire his work. Satisfied, he sheaths the shears in a battle-scarred leather case slung at his side with a well-practiced glide.

Under the canopy of the huge trees, the cooling peace of the forest mists continues to caress the earth amongst the sweeping fern leaves. Two immense redwood trees, grandfathers to their smaller brethren, stand as silent guardians at the entrance to a natural park. The giants are marked by great rents from limbs lost in mighty winds and scars from both fire and mortal carelessness; yet the ancient trees bear these scars like honored badges, a testament to the vast history of this forest. The limbs of the grandfather conifers cross in a beautiful but simple arch over the path between the trees leading into the park.  A pair of tall ancient redwood trees, an open wrought iron gate, and a stack of rocks are here.

The churning waters of the Darkith continue their journey to the ocean beyond the protection of the rocky breakwater to the east.  A small safe harbor sits unflaggingly in the resulting eddy, bolstered by the sand and silt erosion of the Great Divide far beyond the horizon, to the Northeast.  A tidy village hugs the river's edge taking full advantage of the lush island growth and natural haven.  A smooth stone tunnel and a stack of rocks are here.

[Commodore Island Park.]

A worn rock cliff-face juts out from the island's hillside, its worn edges descending steeply until it finally dives down into the depths of the river.  The river's current boils angrily against the staunch rocks, working to tear their very existence into pebbles and sand.  A smooth tunnel paved with flat stones and supported by solid wooden beams cuts through the cliff.  A smooth dark stone tunnel, a Hithual crafted oak barrel, and a huge pile of dirt are here.

A wide avenue paved with gravel cuts the gentle slope of the island's north side and bears the mark of heavy equipment being transported to the interior of the island.   Various stacks of rocks are spaced out along the road and translate into coded messages for the workers to follow.  The roaring rapids of the Darkith fill the air with a constant mist as the water tumbles past the island.

[Commodore Island.]

Sand, debris, rocks, and finally soil deposited by the Darkith river over thousands of years have piled against a natural rock barrier to create an inter-river island.  The course of the mighty Darkith has altered slightly to accomodate the building bulk of the island and now flows on both sides.  Rapids sluice on the east and west side of this island, filling the air with a damp mist that sits heavily on the countryside.  A floating pontoon bridge, some cut green branches, and a large brush pile are here.

[Darkith River Bridge.]

Shuddering and shifting under the weight of all but the smallest travelers, this floating bridge plies the churning dark waters of the Darkith with ponderous grace. Thick hand sawed planks are tied together with huge twisted hemp ropes and cushioned with rubber bumpers to ease the constant ebb of the river's flow.  Each tar-coated plank moves independantly of the others, causing serpentine twists in the bridge's original shape.

[Meetpoint gate.]

A few guards do a roving patrol of the area and down to the bridge. They check the caravans before they enter and anyone that looks suspicious they throw into the river. They seem quite wary of anyone coming or going to and from the city. From their appearance it would seem best to stay on their good sides and hope that they are in good moods.  A closed large sturdy wooden gate, a stone bridge, and some leafy branches and trees are here.

[Meetpoint.]

Here a gate leads out of the fort and into the Southern regions. Several children run and play just inside the gate, under the watchful eyes of the guards. What was once a very well used trade route has slowed to some caravans bringing supplies for the townsmen and the occasional merchants traveling from the far southern reaches of the land. Many guards protect this section of the fort as it is home to some wild beasts that live outside these walls. In the distance, you can make out two more guards hunting the frogmen that often try to attack the city and caravans.  An open large sturdy wooden gate, a glowing wrought iron lantern, and a fluffy white layer of snow are here.

[Meetpoint Square.]

Within the heart of this proud fort one can see all around that the reconstruction of its buildings has begun. Large stones and logs have been stacked and piled, while some workers tirelessly attempt to repair the damage that occurred here during the Lords of Chaos wars. The buildings and homes of the people that resided here are slowly taking shape, though, far from completed. The smell of dyes, used to paint the town, permeate the area.  A breathtaking shimmering bouquet of moonflowers, an open light blue door, a glowing wrought iron street lantern, and a fluffy white layer of snow are here.

Two guards patrol above the gate, looking you over carefully before giving leave to pass through the heavy wood gate. Thick and long wooden ladders serve up to the guard's posts high in the sky so that they may have some relief from their duties overlooking the land and city. Through the slates of the wooden walkways, you can make out four archers playing a game of cards, weapons at the ready. A whip cracks loudly as a caravan heads out the gate towards Spur.  An open wooden gate and a fluffy white layer of snow are here.

The tradeways path leads directly to the imposing north-eastern gate of a stately fort. Even from this distance, the sounds of commerce and progress ring loudly as the harnesses of trader wagons jingle along the busy roadway and saws buzz noisily.

Rising up out of the plains, a large walled fort receives the end of the stone road. The river flows from either side, running through the fort from this angle of view. The vegetation surrounding the tradeway at this point has recently, allowing a clear field of vision from the tops of the walls ahead. The stones show little wear from the heavy traffic.

                        You have visualized the following locations
                        -------------------------------------------

                                    Visualization #1 is:
Through the gate lies the city of Spur, the major center of trade and civilization on the plains. The dusty road leading through the gates is well traveled, and walls of the city are in good repair. A small shack sits to the west of the road, during most times of the day a dusty coach can be seen waiting in front, its horses stomping with impatience to be gone. To the right of the door is a small window, its opening covered with metal bars. An old man, missing most of his teeth, waits patiently for the travelers to pay their fare, and then directs them into the waiting area. On the east side of the road a billowing multicolored tent has been erected, the hustle and bustle of merchants and customers can be seen coming and going at all times of the day.

                                    Visualization #2 is:
Each corner of this square gives entrance to one of the fort's four business establishments. The bank is small, but adequate. The pawnshop and store will see to your buying and selling needs, and the Tarath Wayside Inn is open at all hours to provide shelter for residents and foreigners alike.

                                    Visualization #3 is:
Carefully winding its way up the base of the tree, and wrapping itself around the stairs, a flowering jasmine vine grows tall and lush. Dark scars from a past fire are almost hidden under tufts of fresh growth and moss. A large gap, nearly sixteen feet in distance, rests between the base of a set of stairs and the forest floor. A long moonsilver cord hangs down the side of the tree. If one pulls it, the long Elven rope will descend from above, allowing them to enter the great city of Treehaven. Bright green leaves of clover have begun springing up through the ashy soil in conjunction with soft moss to lend a durable cushion to this well-traveled spot.

[South gate.]

Through the gate lies the city of Spur, the major center of trade and civilization on the plains. The dusty road leading through the gates is well traveled, and walls of the city are in good repair. A small shack sits to the west of the road, during most times of the day a dusty coach can be seen waiting in front, its horses stomping with impatience to be gone. To the right of the door is a small window, its opening covered with metal bars. An old man, missing most of his teeth, waits patiently for the travelers to pay their fare, and then directs them into the waiting area. On the east side of the road a billowing multicolored tent has been erected, the hustle and bustle of merchants and customers can be seen coming and going at all times of the day.  A rainbow silk tent, an open iron gate, and a fluffy white layer of snow are here.

[South Gate.]

A well-guarded gateway separates the city's residential district from the farmlands just beyond. Guards carefully eye all that enter or exit the city, beckoning gruffly to random travelers for a closer inspection. The structure of the guards' barracks is visible above the road to the west. A weathered wooden sign is posted by the gate.  An open iron gate, a wooden sign, a street lantern, an open thick stone door, and a fluffy white layer of snow are here.

The occasional locked gate marks the entrance to some of the more hidden estates of Spurs nobility. From this broad avenue, little can be seen of their splendor. Behind the imposing gate recedes a proud drive, disappearing mysteriously into the trees. If not for the large imposing tower rising above the hedges it would be hard to discern anything was beyond the gate. It is apparent the residents do not wish to be disturbed.  A street lantern, a closed morbius door, and an open black iron gate are here.

Majestic elms continue to line this broad roadway, sheltering the avenue on both sides and further enhancing the grandiose atmosphere. Fronting the beautiful homes, cobbled paths edged with narrow flower beds meander through nearby private gardens. Though they appear wonderful places to spend an afternoon or take a picnic, the glances from those tending the estates makes it clear they are only for the invited.  A street lantern is here.

A small roadway bordered by flowering hedges bisects the wide avenue of Noble Way at a right angle, heading east to west.  A thick, sturdy sign stands just off to the side of a charming path, its large friendly letters intent on luring travelers into the city's premiere roadstay, the Gilded Lion Inn. The entrance is clearly marked and welcoming, extending off to the southeast.  A wooden sign and a street lantern are here.

Occasional gates and driveways lead back into the well-kept estates of the city's nobility, breaking and adding interest to the defining plane of the walls lining Noble Way.

Numerous trees lining the avenue serve as the dividing border between the majestic estates of the nobility and the lightly traveled roadway. The estates themselves are noticeably closer to the avenue than those to the south. However, they are no easier to access, still protected by their own guarding walls, some covered with ivy or colorful blooming vines.  A street lantern is here.

The entire avenue is composed of fine cobblestone, each level with its neighbor, providing a smooth ride for passing carriages and horses. The stones were customized by craftsmen, cut to order, rather than simply placed wherever they might fit. A few stately oaks and elms line the sides of the road, shading travelers during the daylight hours.  A street lantern is here.

The avenue comes to a fork, with Noble Way curving from south to the northwest. A side-street heading off to the east leads to an extremely well kept neighborhood that easily surpasses everything around it in splendor and magnificence. Everything, even the carefully pruned trees and the manicured shrubbery displays a desire for elegant perfection.  A street lantern is here.

Leaving the exceptionally wealthy estates of the Spurian nobility, Noble Way heads toward the Town Square to the northwest. Along the roadside can be seen the in-city homes of successful merchants and other wealthy citizens of the Spur. The homes display a slightly different style, perhaps they are not quite so restrained; a touch more exuberance and freedom with materials is displayed.  A street lantern is here.

Gazing down each of the nearby private drives reveals a glimpse of a luxurious home, each a miniature estate in its own right. Short, stout walls and manicured hedges serve to keep out the riffraff and to protect the small, expensive gardens. Every detail has been attended to display the exotic plants, in all their pampered perfection.  A street lantern and a closed rosewood door are here.

Noble Way continues to wind its way among the rather modestly sized, but elegant, homes of the Spur's successful. Many a peasant farmer may live in homes larger than these, but none can match the quality found here.

Many grand, even ostentatious, homes line this stretch of Noble Way. Most of the residents here were fortunate enough to be born into the right families.

Some of these names could almost be considered famous.  A street lantern is here.

An unusually large home, even for this part of town, lies off to the west. It seems as if one ambitious owner is slowly buying up the lots next to his and adding them to his own. Groundskeepers are at work in the surrounding gardens, trimming and raking, so intent on their work they do not bother to acknowledge the passing traffic on the road.  A street lantern is here.

Standing next to the large iron gate that separates the center of town from those of the elite class are several of the Spurian Guard. They are here to assist all who pass with the simple kindness of opening a gate, or the more important task of escorting those in need to the bank or market.

The boughs of a large apple tree hang over the well tended avenue. Below the beautiful tree stands a small fountain. Atop the fountain is an intricately carved Secian who appears to be dancing with the water as it splashes around her. Set in the marble base is a small plaque that reads, "For those who have gone before us." Many stand for a moment as they pass this way, giving thanks for the gift of life that is given by both the apple tree and the Secians of long ago. Large piles of dirt and broken stone lay on either side of the street as workmen ready the east and west alleys for expansion.  A street lantern, a closed Secian etched moonsilver door, a pair of open silver forged swinging doors, and a sign above the doors are here.

Vast estates tower over the huge Spurian wall towards the south. The well-to-do who live in these homes idle away their days, enjoying the luxury of time. Standing next to a very empty lantern pole, a small Flerian child insists in a plaintive wail, that he had nothing to do with the missing lantern. The well-dressed guard that interrogates him keeps pointing at a small sack on the ground and its obvious contents.  An open small burlap sack, a street lantern, and a lantern are here.

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.  A marble statue of a Human, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a rosewood sign, a crisp gold lettered vellum notice, a flowing white marble fountain, a shimmering marble statue of a Dragon, an empty black bottle of web potion, an empty black bottle of web potion, and a small wooden alms bowl are here.
