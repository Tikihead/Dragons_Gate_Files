The traffic on the northern street heading away from town square is an eclectic bunch.  Those who belong to the guilds to the north travel in packs on their way to and from guild events.  It is not unusual to see a group of armored fighters passing a group of robed clerics, each heading in the opposite direction. The large temple of Rinanni rises to the north, its white marble almost glowing in the light.  A street lantern and a pristine white tent are here.

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.   A flowing white marble fountain, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a marble statue of a Human, a carved marble statue of a Dragon, a rosewood sign, and some flower embedded smelly black droppings are here.

Hundreds of softly glowing white candles of various shapes and sizes have been strategically placed around the inside of this large tent gently illuminated the darkness with warm pleasant light. The dark hardwood dance floor has been polished to a mirror-like finish, while somehow offering comfortable traction to the couples dancing upon its surface. High above, exotic cloths in various jewel tones have been draped and gathered into an intricate pattern. Plush velvet cushioned chairs line the walls of the room, giving a comfortable resting spot for weary dancers.  Some plush velvet chairs, some glowing soft white candles, a basket of party favors, an exit, and some vomit are here.

A diverse group of people travel through this large iron gateway. Gladiators lead criminals towards the arena. It is readily apparent that only the gladiators return, usually with a satisfied smirk on their faces. A large group of guards on top of the large Spurian Wall keeps a careful watch on the downtrodden who travel this way. Their appearance makes them suspect, their lack of strength, natural victims.  An open iron gate and a street lantern are here.

Huge, colorful silk banners float proudly in the breeze from the giant stone arch that provides passage to the reopened Spurian Arena. The gladiators that once sat dejected and forlorn against the arch now stand proudly and alert, polishing their swords to the highest sheen, and adjusting their helms and breastplates. A long line of potential competitors and audience members alike is beginning to form, the last of whom glance uneasily in the direction of the looming cemetary before turning their attention back on the huge arena ahead.

A large double gate opens on the south side of the road, leading down an old cobbled path. Large wagons, small ox carts, and in some cases old buckboards make the turn toward the cemetery carrying their precious cargo to its final resting place. A large group of darkly-clad San Elves stand just outside the gate, carefully perusing those who pass by. It becomes obvious that those in Taath's Temple will be quickly informed of any insurgent groups heading their direction.  A large double gate is here.

The crowd travels in both directions, moving with definite purpose. Downtrodden and of modest means, most wear the tattered clothing of the poor.

It is quite apparent that nothing short of a nice meaty bone is going to make him budge. Those who travel this path keep their heads lowered and ignore the comical scene. A gnawing hunger and aching muscles after a long day of hard work keep most from paying attention to even the simple things around them.

Uniformed guards patrol high above, conscientiously glancing down to assure peace is being kept along this well-traveled road. A crotchety old man leans against the wall, just out of view of the guards, counting the coin he has thus far appropriated this fine day.  An open iron gate and a closed thick stone door are here.

To the north, the remains of an ancient village open up before you. Only stone foundations and piles of rubble remain to mark that the village ever existed. Wild, thorny scrubs grow everywhere. The ground slopes steeply downhill to the south. The river flows out from behind a large mound to the west and disappears into the distance.

No foundations lie in this area, allowing easy passage for those traveling along Highland Road. The number of thorny bushes growing in the road indicates that the traffic along it is very light. The remains of the village's buildings stretch out on both sides of the road. The smell of death hangs heavily in the air.

The road slopes uphill very steeply to the north and then northeast along a rocky ridge. The almost skeletal remains of an ancient village spreads out to the south. The scale of the building's foundations and doorways suggest those once living here were Human or similarly sized, but there is no way to be sure.

Old rusted sconces stand sentry along both sides of this end of the giant tunnel. While time has marred the surface of the tunnel walls with minute cracks, the absolute precision and remarkable smoothness of the carved rock are still very impressive.

The walls of the tunnel bear witness to the constant pressures of the tons of stone above. Water seeps through large fractures to a small pool. Small piles of rocks litter the floor and the air is heavy with moisture. Footsteps produce a crunching rhythm, out of sync with one's quickening heartbeat.

No exit is visible from this section of the tunnel, only a choice of east or west. A few hastily assembled wooden beams seem to support entire weight of the mountain. It is a harrowing thought to consider how much rock hangs on a these few prudently placed support beams made of decaying wood.  Some rotting wooden beams are here.

While the tunnel is still well made and structurally sound, the air deep within is dank and moist. On closer inspection, hair-line fractures have appeared in the smoothly cut tunnel walls, allowing a few moist rivuletes to seep through onto the granite's surface. The walls are streaked dark from the constant flow of the cold, clear water.

The oppressive weight of the mountain bears down on one's awareness, with the same force that it pressures the tunnel walls. The continuing feeling of stress and resistance, push and shove, makes the construction of the tunnel a wonder to behold.

The dark granite walls of the tunnel are so well engineered that no cracks have appeared, even after years of pressure from the mountain. The lack of telltale dust or sand fouling the perfect floor does little to take one's mind off the looming presence of millions of tons of rock above.

Huge boulders have created a bowl shaped depression in this sheltered hillock. A stand of scruffy trees continues to eke out a tenuous existence above the rocky outpost; their long tortured roots clinging desperately to what little soil is caught between the boulders.

Old trees lay side by side with the massive boulders of the mountain, intermingling in a terrible landslide. The mountain top has broken off and slid across the eastern road stopping all forms of transportation. It would take years for mortal hands to remove the tons of stone from the original roadway to make it passable once again. Thankfully, nature has changed the landscape for the better, and has opened a gap through the mountain to the north.

Old trees lay side by side with the massive boulders of the mountain, intermingling in a terrible landslide. The mountain top has broken off and slid across the eastern road stopping all forms of transportation. It would take years for mortal hands to remove the tons of stone from the original roadway to make it passable once again. Thankfully, nature has changed the landscape for the better, and has opened a gap through the mountain to the north.

Behind the Great Gate of Aerhauven, the tunnel opens up into a huge cavern. The jagged surface of the cavern's ceiling reveal where large chunks of stone had fallen during the deadly cave-ins of 313. The market is spread to the east, while temples and some shops lie along the Outer Road to the north and south. The streets are lit by huge lanterns fed by pipes that draw some sort of fuel from below the city.  An open embossed steel gate is here.

The momentous forces that have wrought this valley still press upon the land and have done so for eons.  The walls of the valley are sheer and steep, and untouched by the raging waters of river or stream.  As if in testimony to the power of the forces that move the land, a huge dark boulder sits off to the side of the road. It is hewn in half like a sliced melon.  One part sits 20 feet north along the break in the rocks from the other part.

One layer of rock in the steep walls has eroded faster then the harder granite or bedrock above and below it. Soft sandstone has been stripped away to form an arch in the valley wall ... a concave indention that goes for hundreds of feet in both directions.  Within the hardened sediment left ages ago upon the land are treasures beyond value: fossilized shells by the thousands, in all sizes, shapes and colors.

The merchant road threads through bottom of the small, narrow valley. Sheer granite walls block the view from the well traveled road to either side and above, only a narrow ray of sky testifies to the time of day. The engineers set a route as far as possible from the broken stones in the center of the valley and, by luck or design, this foresight has saved the road-bed from constant reconstruction. Small cracks run parallel to the road, but none have broken through the thick layers of sand and stone.

The merchant road cuts straight through a hill where men and beasts must have toiled to remove tons of blasted rock and dirt. The choice to remove hundreds of feet of hillside was more prudent to the road engineers then a long series of switch-backs that would have to climb the steep hillside for hundreds of feet. Tube shaped holes drilled into the bedrock still remain from when the roadbed was blasted eons years ago.

The choice to remove hundreds of feet of hillside was more prudent to the road engineers then a long series of switch-backs that would have to climb the steep hillside for hundreds of feet. Tube shaped holes drilled into the bedrock still remain from when the roadbed was blasted eons years ago.  A closed downy bag is here.

What is a well engineered road in the tamer steppe-lands becomes a minor miracle through the rougher hills and valleys. The road bed remains flat and easy to travel despite the rocky terrain. Each incline and decline in the road is fixed to an agreeable grade for most wagons and sleds.

The merchant road follows the wandering path of the small stream. Towering pine trees grow thickly in this hidden forest.  Delicate, ground hugging ferns, thorny brambles with glossy leaves, and mountain laurels grow densely along the vale in the light shade of the pines.

A sharp splash in the calm pool sends ripples down the stream and echoes off the narrow valley's walls.

Tall, rough barked pine trees dominate the canyon floor as far as the eye can see. The vaulting slender trees compete for the sunlight high above the forest floor, leaving great visibility throughout the valley. At the south end of the hidden vale, the slow stream runs muddy as it snakes and loops around some of the older trees. Towards the north is an unnatural grouping of low lying mud domes.

From here, it is possible to observe an astounding 360 degree vista of the towering mountains to the north, the thick oak forest to the southeast, and more dry grasslands to the south and west. The terrain buckles and bends towards the north like a giant rug of trees and rocks had been pushed towards a wall of solid rock.

A brisk wind barrels down from the mountains to the north, its touch filled with the promise of ice and snow. As it passes the dry road-bed, it mixes with the warm moist air of the river valley that creeps north and causes dust dervishes that spin their opaque bodies thousands of feet into the air. The sharp bladed grasses shiver and swirl as the tiny twisters weave their way across the steppe.

[North Bridge Trail.]

Game trails cut back and forth across the merchants road covered with the split, sharp toed hoof prints of deer and elk. Dark spoor mark the trails most frequently used by the herbivores: the hunted. Sharp yipping pierces the cold, quiet air from both sides of the road: the hunters. The widely spaced junipers, scrub oaks, and mountain hawthorns offer ample cover for the pack of wolves to range unseen through the plateau.

Blending perfectly with the muted hues of the arid surroundings, a lone timber wolf stalks the outer edges of the grassland about a half a mile from the merchant road. The wolf's ears are perked to listen for the rustling of the bushy tailed jack rabbits that thrive in the prairie. The wolf lifts it nose to catch a scent, howls briefly and trots off towards the southeast to catch it's prey from downwind.

Bright green trees and healthy bushes stand out sporadically on the dusty steppe. The little spring fed islands are surrounded by the blue-green grasses that thrive here. All manner of beasts are drawn to the springs and the protection they offer. Bright blue scrub jays chatter noisily among themselves as they dart and swerve in accomplished aerial feats pursuing their winged insect meals. A small herd of wary jackrabbits stop munching the grass to turn their white ears towards the merchant road. The nearest jack to the road stands on his hind legs and tests the air for any scent of their many predators.

Thicker stalked grasses grow here on this high plateau where the air is rarified and rain spills quickly down the small rocky gullies. A few staunch oaks grow alone or in groups of one or two, their roots exposed where they cling to the rocky soil for sustenance. Thin, scraggly junipers suck up what little moisture the soil does manage to hold. The merchant road placidly passes by, untouched by time in the dry environment.

The merchant road swerves around a rock strewn hill. Several ancient oak trees grow in solitary wonder on the south side of the hill. Dead fall and broken branches cover the hollow and is home for a family of thick furred marmots. The dark brown colored rodents stare out of the dark recesses of the dead branches with shiny black eyes. A brace of buck-toothed, adolescent marmots scramble for cover as the shrill cry of a hawk sounds further up the mountain.

To the southeast, two streams trickle from the north and pass directly under the roadbed. The twin streams combine as they travel down the hill to make a picture-perfect waterfall rimmed by delicate maidenhair ferns and bright green moss. The little riverlet from the pool then flows into an ancient oak forest further southeast.

Hand pounded concrete pipes, half circle in shape, channel two small streams under the chinked rock and gravel road-bed. The icy spring water bubbles down the hill and glides over a sheet of shorn granite until it fills a crystal clear pool at the bottom, far below the road. The pool's overflow creates a single clear stream that meanders towards the ancient oak forest.

The merchant road takes a large bend as it travels through the dark woodland. Venerable, wide-trunked oaks line the merchant road and the trunks of the closest ones have been marked by the passage of thousands of travelers and adventurers.

Off to the side of the road, perhaps a hundred feet away, stands an enormous tree that commands the attention of all who pass this direction. It's offspring populate the plateau for miles in both directions. At one time, the tree must have stood alone on the prairie soil and dropped acorns year after year until one tree became a huge forest of oaks.

The merchant road follows a bumpy path through the oak forest. Each stately old tree has added a few feet to it's girth since the road was first surveyed and constructed hundreds of years ago. Their roots have plied across the road, upending it's hand laid foundation and hand pounded bed. Several large knees of the oak's roots have leveraged up the edges of the road, hindering all wagons' passage and threatening to break spokes and axles.

The merchant road makes a wide turn as it passes through the thick oak forest. A tiny meadow with a murmuring creek is the only open spot in sight. Bright wildflowers and fragrant mosses crowd around a sparkling jewel of a pond while the huge oaks stand like sentinels around the edges. A spotted fawn and its doe-eyed mother drink cautiously, swishing their white edged tails quickly.

Crunching loudly on the road is a ankle high deposit of acorn hulls and their discarded caps. Quick footed grey squirrels dash across the road, or above on the high intertwined branches of the stately oaks, with the highly coveted acorns grasped firmly in their teeth. The squirrels flash their tails at each other in some unknown signal as traffic passes on the road.  A pile of empty acorn caps is here.

The grassland plateau is embraced by a stand of dark green oak trees so thick that little light passes through the profusion of their many lobed leaves. The forest is ancient and the trunks of the trees bare witness to fires, lightning strikes and the attacks of insects. Large gout-like burls disfigure some of the wide, grey trunks which have grown quietly next to the road for hundreds of years.

The merchant roads widens as it travels another grass swept plateau. The mountain range fills the northern skyline in stark detail. Huge snow capped peaks and rough faced cliffs are close enough to see the individual boulders, waterfalls, and haphazard game trails. Much higher up the great mountainsides a line where trees stop growing gives testament to the altitude. The air is cool.

The roadway takes advantage of a cut in the hill to negotiate a tumbled cliff face. At the top of the hill is a high, flat, steppe grassland, and at the bottom is the edge of the open range. At one point, the road narrows to cross a small stream. Very little mud gathers in the shallows of the stream and the pebbles and rocks glitter like gold as the wagon wheels churn the gravel.

White barked birch trees populate the moist valleys that drain into the river to the southeast as the merchant road passes nearby. The tall vertical trees reach to the sky in a beautiful dance reminiscent of dancers waving their arms gracefully to some unheard rhythm. The grain-laden grasses sway in accompaniment, and the tinkling waterfalls and babbling creeks beat like odd syncopated patterns onto the rocks.

With the care and attention to detail rarely given to a mundane project such as a road, the engineers foresaw potential hazards and built the solutions into their finished project.

Running parallel to the road is a smooth rock lined trench that channels the road's run-off during rainstorms. This flat part of the road that follows the valley floor would be prone to turn into a muddy bog and therefore a hazard to most caravans and their pack animals. Anticipating this event, the road's engineers built drains into the lower side of the road that carry the runoff into the culvert, which carries it harmlessly down to the low end of the valley.

Water loving trees hug the river's course through the low lying valley. Giant beech and huge alders vie for the valuable sodden shoreline and shade the understory bushes and ferns from direct sunlight. The result is a lushly green, verdant forest that obscures the river from the view on the road, though the hiss of rushing water reveals it's course.

The decaying remains of the bridge workers camp sprawls across this flat valley. To house their draft beasts, the workers constructed small stalls and shelters from rickety boards nailed quixotically to the standing trees. Three brass ring topped posts lie sunk into the grasslands turf, to the south, which was most likely used for tethering grazing animals. Between the posts is a rough stone trough that is filled automatically with water by a rickety mechanical wind mill, whirling lazily in the breeze.

Boulders stacked in pyramids contained by large timbers stand mutely to the side of the roadway next to an impromptu dump of broken tools, wooden stakes and empty buckets lined with mortar. Deeply grooved sled tracks lead to the east towards the bridge from this part of the road where the flatness of the valley was best suited for the staging area during the bridge's reconstruction. Smooth rectangles of tent foundations still mark their location in a semi circle around a blackened fire ring where the workers and their supervisors lived during it's rebuilding.

On the northern edge of the road stands a tall, flat rock. Chipped into the shape of a pillar and abraded to smoothness, it bears the stamped surveyor's mark of the road's builder. The mark's grooved letters are filled with sand and dust and obscured from age, but the arrows delineating north, south, east and west are clear and easy to read. The rest of the stamp is undecipherable and lends mystery to the road's origin.

Withstanding seasonal floods and constant traffic, the durable road shows how affective good design and competent construction can be. It travels a hand paved berm straight to an imposing grey stone bridge to the southeast. The pilons of the bridge are cloaked in river mist as the raging river sweeps by.

A massive stone bridge spans a raging grey tinted river as it runs it's course towards the southeast. The mud around the bridge footings has been churned by wheels of quarry wagons, tracks of sleds bearing block and tackle, shod hooves of draft beasts and booted feet of masons and bridge workers. The newer parts of the huge bridge are obvious due to the contrast in colors of mortar and rock. Bright banners snap briskly in the wind from both ends of the bridge.  A broken wooden wagon is here.

A few proud workers chiseled their initials and the date into their handiwork, most reading the date of Rinannimas, 6th month, 61st day, year 313. Bright banners flutter in the breeze on both sides of the bridge as if in celebration of it's victory over both the river's truculence and sabotage.

In the middle of the stone bridge's span, a carved stone plaque is set into the masonry of the rock wall. Worked black marble bears a likeness of a San Elf and a brief warning describing her and her crimes against the merchants who depend on this bridge for their livelihood.

The river surges strongly below the stone span. Even from this height, the noise of the flowing water is near deafening. Two small fishing boats nearly collide as they try to tack between the same set of supports. Only skillful sailing prevents them from hitting each other, or the supports.

The huge stone bridge span was built tall to allow the various merchant ships to pass underneath. This amazing height affords a splendid view of the countryside: from the blur of smoky residential air to the southeast, across the verdant grasslands that cover the foothills, to the majestic peaks of the mountain range to the north.

The massive stone bridge expands over the raging river, it's huge pilons buried deep in the river's bottom. Within sight and just downstream, the water rushes past what remains of the old bridge, causing dangerous under-currents. Bright red bouys mark the broken fragments locations and signs tell of the peril. The river pilots earn their pay negotiating this treacherous obstacle.

The metal grey river deposits a sandbar on its western bank near the merchant road, causing a snag of dead logs, branches and floating debris. A cat sized rodent, with long teeth, flat tail and webbed toes peaks briefly over the jumbled tangle of branches before dipping back into the frigid water without a splash.

The raging silver-cast river cuts through the grassland and heads southeast. Fishing boats, bearing the crest of the city of Spur, dart around several barges laden with exotic wares to trade in the merchant city. Most bear the purple livery of the city of Rathan, but every so often a ship flying unfamiliar colors can be sighted.

Just to the north, the roadway curves gently around a bend in a large river that flows towards the southeast. An enormous smooth round rock splits off a small eddy from the main current resulting a deep, clear pool by the eastern side of the road. The cool calm water catches the reflection of the white snowcapped mountain range further up the valley while the river rushes past towards Spur. Five fishermen recline on folding chairs or against rocks, tethered by the silvery lines of their poles to the fishing hole. Each fisherman is spread evenly around the pool as if held apart by some invisible barrier as they eye the large shadowy fish shapes finning effortlessly against the mild current in the eddy.

Empty wooden crates, broken harnesses, damaged pottery, and the usual byproducts of food preparation fill an impromptu refuse pile adjacent to two campsites. Both two and four legged scavengers ply through the pile, scattering it further and enlarging the boundary. The result is a landmark of incongruous shapes, colors and shadows along the otherwise bland sweep of grasslands through which the roadway travels.

Broadening to fill the lee of a wide valley, the roadway passes by several temporary campsites where caravans have bolstered the existing comforts for their temporary encampments. Neat stacks of foraged sticks and axe-hewn firewood sit adjacent to the blackened rocks of two impromptu fire rings. Freshly dug midden pits waft clues to the camp's frequent use into the clean mountain air.

The worn merchants road travels the southern side of a low hill in one wide arc. The broad path is slightly banked to accomodate for the turn and incline. On the exposed side of the road, the sturdy road-bed is exposed to the elements and yet has remained solid.

As the road bends around a curve, ruts left by merchant's wagons cut so deeply into the mud that all wheeled vehicles are forced to follow the set path. Four loaded wagons of a merchants caravan stand idle as one larger than standard wagon skitters along the path. The buckboard's frame groans and strains to keep it inline while the driver attempts to negotiate the turn. Four dark maned, matched mules balk at the noise behind them, and stomp nervously over the deep ruts. The liveried caravan guards attempt to haul the mules forward, further adding to the mules stubborn refusal to move.

The travel-worn road dips and curves around the low lying foothills. Each pass over the top of hillsides presents a new view of the mountain range. Each dip into small valleys reveal minute eco-systems that exist in each wagon wheel rut where water collects. Splayed avion tracks dot the dried mud in random order permanently recording the hunters conquest of lesser things from the mud and moss.

The mountains to the north reflect in perfectly upside-down symmetry on the still pond's surface, only wavering slightly in concentric circles to the deft touch of small insects.

A rickety criss-crossed rough beam fence pens the grazing of black and white cows whose ponderous forms are barely visible through the tall grass on either side of the road. To the north, the soft, undulating grassland floor of the wide valley succumbs to the rolling foothills, which in turn delineates the imposing outline of a vista-spanning mountain range. Many a traveler has witnessed this idyllic vantage point and has been drawn on to follow the road that travels into the heart of the mountains.

Grassy plains stretch out to the west across the wide flat valley broken only by the outline of a dark forest further to the southwest. The huge expanse of waving stalks is home to creatures large and small. Each has adapted to their own niche and are camouflaged from the casual observers gaze.

From the west spans a dark green forest of Sycamore and Beech trees that soak in the moister parts of the lower river valley. The tall, shaded forest breaks like a green tinged wave upon the tranquil calm of the grasslands. The huge trees within are ancient, reaching hundreds of feet into the air. As if steaming from a great cauldron, a heavy ground fog seeps from deep within the forest carrying with it the fresh smell of decomposing green matter.

Lush grass grows up to the borders of a thick, dense forest that cloaks the hills to the west. The grasslands thin near the grove as the huge trees completely shade the ground, and are replaced by taller bushes and juniper trees. The contrast between the waving stalks on the flat vista and the dark leaves of almost vertical trees is striking.

In the dusty distance, Spur's great wall demarks the southern end of this well-traveled merchant's road. Soaring majestically to the north stands the spiky pinnacles and snow topped peaks of an epic mountain range so immense that it separates lands, races, and cultures. Connecting the two is a merchant road built long ago.

The path is flanked by countless tall oaks, swaying peacefully in the wind. They do their best to hide the sky from view, making it hard to tell night from day at times.

The remnants of a violent fight lie all around you, whomever used to belong to the wagon is no more than vulture food.  A bloody severed foot is here.

Travelers from Rathan to the northwest, and the Trade Route to the south, converge at Spur's west gate. Guards posted on the ground give those seeking to enter the city a cursory once-over. Their lack of interest shows that anyone approaching has already been observed from above for some time. A grate in the ground loosens mud from wagon wheels and hooves before they pass through the gate, helping to keep the streets of Spur fairly clean.  An open giant black iron gate, a giant green oak tree, a small blue pool, a thick oak grate over the pool, and a polished stone marker are here.

The relative safety inside Spur is a comfort to those returning from the fields and mountains. To those leaving, a massive wall of defense around the city lies ahead. Archer towers beside the gate overlook the wall, offering a painful welcome to would-be invaders. Several guards on foot patrol pass and disappear behind a thick, bluesteel banded steelwood door. Wall road stretches to the south, a wide passage between the city wall and several large buildings.  An open iron gate, an open thick stone door, and a street lantern are here.

The cobblestones of the road are smooth and even. The attention to detail shown here is a dramatic change from some of the other parts of the city.  A street lantern is here.

An unusually large home, even for this part of town, lies off to the west. It seems as if one ambitious owner is slowly buying up the lots next to his and adding them to his own. Groundskeepers are at work in the surrounding gardens, trimming and raking, so intent on their work they do not bother to acknowledge the passing traffic on the road.  A street lantern is here.

Many grand, even ostentatious, homes line this stretch of Noble Way. Most of the residents here were fortunate enough to be born into the right families. Few that live in this area have ever actually had to work for a living. Glancing at the nameplates reveals many of the recognizable names of the Spur. Some of these names could almost be considered famous.  A street lantern is here.

Noble Way continues to wind its way among the rather modestly sized, but elegant, homes of the Spur's successful. Many a peasant farmer may live in homes larger than these, but none can match the quality found here. A peaceful, luxurious feeling pervades this part of town; perhaps it is the drifting floral scents wafting from the well-tended gardens.  A closed elegant black iron gate and a street lantern are here.

Gazing down each of the nearby private drives reveals a glimpse of a luxurious home, each a miniature estate in its own right. Short, stout walls and manicured hedges serve to keep out the riffraff and to protect the small, expensive gardens. Every detail has been attended to display the exotic plants, in all their pampered perfection.  A street lantern and a closed rosewood door are here.

Leaving the exceptionally wealthy estates of the Spurian nobility, Noble Way heads toward the Town Square to the northwest. Along the roadside can be seen the in-city homes of successful merchants and other wealthy citizens of the Spur. The homes display a slightly different style, perhaps they are not quite so restrained; a touch more exuberance and freedom with materials is displayed.  A street lantern is here.

The avenue comes to a fork, with Noble Way curving from south to the northwest. A side-street heading off to the east leads to an extremely well kept neighborhood that easily surpasses everything around it in splendor and magnificence. Everything, even the carefully pruned trees and the manicured shrubbery displays a desire for elegant perfection.  A street lantern is here.

The entire avenue is composed of fine cobblestone, each level with its neighbor, providing a smooth ride for passing carriages and horses. The stones were customized by craftsmen, cut to order, rather than simply placed wherever they might fit. A few stately oaks and elms line the sides of the road, shading travelers during the daylight hours.  A street lantern is here.

Numerous trees lining the avenue serve as the dividing border between the majestic estates of the nobility and the lightly traveled roadway. The estates themselves are noticeably closer to the avenue than those to the south. However, they are no easier to access, still protected by their own guarding walls, some covered with ivy or colorful blooming vines.  A street lantern is here.

Occasional gates and driveways lead back into the well-kept estates of the city's nobility, breaking and adding interest to the defining plane of the walls lining Noble Way. The rest of the street seems to mimic the splendor of the estates beyond the wall. Swept and trimmed, the roadway exudes a simple, yet beautiful elegance.  A street lantern is here.

A small roadway bordered by flowering hedges bisects the wide avenue of Noble Way at a right angle, heading east to west.  A thick, sturdy sign stands just off to the side of a charming path, its large friendly letters intent on luring travelers into the city's premiere roadstay, the Gilded Lion Inn. The entrance is clearly marked and welcoming, extending off to the southeast.  A wooden sign and a street lantern are here.

Majestic elms continue to line this broad roadway, sheltering the avenue on both sides and further enhancing the grandiose atmosphere.

Though they appear wonderful places to spend an afternoon or take a picnic, the glances from those tending the estates makes it clear they are only for the invited.  A street lantern is here.

The occasional locked gate marks the entrance to some of the more hidden estates of Spurs nobility. From this broad avenue, little can be seen of their splendor. Behind the imposing gate recedes a proud drive, disappearing mysteriously into the trees. If not for the large imposing tower rising above the hedges it would be hard to discern anything was beyond the gate. It is apparent the residents do not wish to be disturbed.  A street lantern, a closed morbius door, and an open black iron gate are here.

A well-guarded gateway separates the city's residential district from the farmlands just beyond. Guards carefully eye all that enter or exit the city, beckoning gruffly to random travelers for a closer inspection. The structure of the guards' barracks is visible above the road to the west. A weathered wooden sign is posted by the gate.  An open stone gate, a wooden sign, an open thick stone door, and a street lantern are here.

Through the gate lies the city of Spur, the major center of trade and civilization on the plains. The dusty road leading through the gates is well traveled, and walls of the city are in good repair. A small shack sits to the west of the road, during most times of the day a dusty coach can be seen waiting in front, its horses stomping with impatience to be gone. To the right of the door is a small window, its opening covered with metal bars. An old man, missing most of his teeth, waits patiently for the travelers to pay their fare, and then directs them into the waiting area. On the east side of the road a billowing multicolored tent has been erected, the hustle and bustle of merchants and customers can be seen coming and going at all times of the day.  A rainbow silk tent and an open iron gate are here.

Even though it shows heavy wear, the road is in remarkably good repair. It was built by expert craftsmen to withstand the rigors of time and use.

The stones of the road are smoothly set together, well built to withstand heavy travel. A broken wagon wheel, discarded some time ago, covers a spot of nearby grass, weeds trying to climb through the spokes.  Some glowing festive rainbow diamond lanterns are here.
