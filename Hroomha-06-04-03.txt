A massive black stone wall stands guard over the west side of Emjedah. Uniformed sentries pace slowly along the wall walk, as majestic flags of red, black, and blue rise high above two triple-turret Hawk Towers. The flags thrash crisply with the mountain's windy exhale. A steadfast stream of twisting rapids curls around the outer surface of the wall. The white-capped water cuts a treacherous path through rocks and ledges while it winds itself under an intricately carved stone drawbridge.  A moonsilver lettered teak sign, a moonsilver lettered teak Notice Of Exiles, a moonsilver lettered teak Notice Of Exiles #2, and an intricately carved stone drawbridge are here.

A small roadway bordered by flowering hedges bisects the wide avenue of Noble Way at a right angle, heading east to west.  A thick, sturdy sign stands just off to the side of a charming path, its large friendly letters intent on luring travelers into the city's premiere roadstay, the Gilded Lion Inn. The entrance is clearly marked and welcoming, extending off to the southeast.  A wooden sign and a street lantern are here.

Occasional gates and driveways lead back into the well-kept estates of the city's nobility, breaking and adding interest to the defining plane of the walls lining Noble Way. The rest of the street seems to mimic the splendor of the estates beyond the wall. Swept and trimmed, the roadway exudes a simple, yet beautiful elegance.  A street lantern is here.

Numerous trees lining the avenue serve as the dividing border between the majestic estates of the nobility and the lightly traveled roadway. The estates themselves are noticeably closer to the avenue than those to the south. However, they are no easier to access, still protected by their own guarding walls, some covered with ivy or colorful blooming vines.  A street lantern is here.

The entire avenue is composed of fine cobblestone, each level with its neighbor, providing a smooth ride for passing carriages and horses. The stones were customized by craftsmen, cut to order, rather than simply placed wherever they might fit. A few stately oaks and elms line the sides of the road, shading travelers during the daylight hours.  A street lantern is here.

The avenue comes to a fork, with Noble Way curving from south to the northwest. A side-street heading off to the east leads to an extremely well kept neighborhood that easily surpasses everything around it in splendor and magnificence. Everything, even the carefully pruned trees and the manicured shrubbery displays a desire for elegant perfection.  A street lantern is here.

Leaving the exceptionally wealthy estates of the Spurian nobility, Noble Way heads toward the Town Square to the northwest. Along the roadside can be seen the in-city homes of successful merchants and other wealthy citizens of the Spur. The homes display a slightly different style, perhaps they are not quite so restrained; a touch more exuberance and freedom with materials is displayed.  A street lantern is here.

Gazing down each of the nearby private drives reveals a glimpse of a luxurious home, each a miniature estate in its own right. Short, stout walls and manicured hedges serve to keep out the riffraff and to protect the small, expensive gardens. Every detail has been attended to display the exotic plants, in all their pampered perfection.  A street lantern and a closed rosewood door are here.

Noble Way continues to wind its way among the rather modestly sized, but elegant, homes of the Spur's successful. Many a peasant farmer may live in homes larger than these, but none can match the quality found here. A peaceful, luxurious feeling pervades this part of town; perhaps it is the drifting floral scents wafting from the well-tended gardens.  An elegant black iron gate and a street lantern are here.

Many grand, even ostentatious, homes line this stretch of Noble Way. Most of the residents here were fortunate enough to be born into the right families. Few that live in this area have ever actually had to work for a living. Glancing at the nameplates reveals many of the recognizable names of the Spur. Some of these names could almost be considered famous.  A street lantern is here.

An unusually large home, even for this part of town, lies off to the west. It seems as if one ambitious owner is slowly buying up the lots next to his and adding them to his own. Groundskeepers are at work in the surrounding gardens, trimming and raking, so intent on their work they do not bother to acknowledge the passing traffic on the road.  A street lantern is here.

An elegant, carved wooden sign hangs above the ornate gateway set into the massive wall that divides Spurs Noble District from the Town Square. You can make out city guardsmen peering down attentively at all that approach from their posts atop the imposing wall. They seem to take a greater interest in this part of town, though there does not seem to be anything threatening enough here to warrant such attention.

Standing next to the large iron gate that separates the center of town from those of the elite class are several of the Spurian Guard. They are here to assist all who pass with the simple kindness of opening a gate, or the more important task of escorting those in need to the bank or market. A young looking cadet rubs wax into the stones of the city wall, his task is daunting, but one that will teach him discipline.  An open iron gate and a street lantern are here.

The boughs of a large apple tree hang over the well tended avenue. Below the beautiful tree stands a small fountain. Atop the fountain is an intricately carved Secian who appears to be dancing with the water as it splashes around her. Set in the marble base is a small plaque that reads, "For those who have gone before us." Many stand for a moment as they pass this way, giving thanks for the gift of life that is given by both the apple tree and the Secians of long ago. Large piles of dirt and broken stone lay on either side of the street as workmen ready the east and west alleys for expansion.  A street lantern is here.

Vast estates tower over the huge Spurian wall towards the south. The well-to-do who live in these homes idle away their days, enjoying the luxury of time. Standing next to a very empty lantern pole, a small Flerian child insists in a plaintive wail, that he had nothing to do with the missing lantern. The well-dressed guard that interrogates him keeps pointing at a small sack on the ground and its obvious contents.  An open small burlap sack and a street lantern are here.

The outward appearance of the people here seems a bit classier. Rich clothing and large coin purses are prevalent amongst the travelers. In fact, many of the folk heading into Town Square from the south are accompanied by large bodyguards to assure their safety. The well maintained road is lined with small brass lanterns, each swinging off an individual pole. No expense has been spared to keep those who travel this road safe from the hoodlums that relish the darkness.  A street lantern is here.

A massive gate dominates the center of Town Square. Monolithic stone dragons stand to each side of the gate like sentinels keeping watch over the city of Spur. The gigantic wings of the dragons are stretched high overhead, forming the gate's sculpted arch. Townsfolk stare at the monument with awe and reverence as they quickly wander by. Beneath the colossal structure rests a large marble fountain. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a shimmering blue pool. Lifelike marble statues have been placed around the city square to celebrate the famous heroes of the past.  Some white marble benches, some flowering shrubbery, a carved marble statue of a Human, a carved marble statue of a Dragon, a brightly painted wooden birdhouse, a crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped bench, a flowing white marble fountain, and an ancient dusty cask of aged brandy are here.

Condie scowls.

Vartac chuckles at Condie.

A swirl of golden feathers begins to spiral around Dainty.

The runespell loses integrity and dissipates!

Condie has left Vartac's group.

Condie, running passed you, just went southeast.

Vartac circles around and does some aerial acrobatics!

[Town Square Center.]

A massive gate dominates the center of Town Square. Monolithic stone dragons stand to each side of the gate like sentinels keeping watch over the city of Spur. The gigantic wings of the dragons are stretched high overhead, forming the gate's sculpted arch. Townsfolk stare at the monument with awe and reverence as they quickly wander by. Beneath the colossal structure rests a large marble fountain. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a shimmering blue pool. Lifelike marble statues have been placed around the city square to celebrate the famous heroes of the past.  Some white marble benches, some flowering shrubbery, a carved marble statue of a Human, a carved marble statue of a Dragon, a brightly painted wooden birdhouse, a crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped bench, a flowing white marble fountain, and an ancient dusty cask of aged brandy are here.

[Town Square.]

The elegant Hotel Royale towers above the street, its emerald door sparkling in the light. The patrons that stroll in and out are catered to, doors opened and closed for them, and baggage and packages carried by harried servants. The large Bank of Spur sits on the east side of the square. Its location close to the Royale is not a coincidence. A gold-trimmed door is proof of the success of this branch of the Spurian bank and those who run it.  An elegant gold-trimmed walnut door, open emerald steel door, and a street lantern are here.

>[The Royale.]

A short entrance hall provides passage in and out of the exquisite Hotel Royale. A burly Thugian and a tall Monitanian carefully assess everyone as they enter. They prevent any pets from entering and keep out all but the quickest or sneakiest of the riffraff. A narrow passageway leads to the stables.  An open emerald steel door is here.

This room is illuminated.
