Old trees lay side by side with the massive boulders of the mountain, intermingling in a terrible landslide. The mountain top has broken off and slid across the eastern road stopping all forms of transportation. It would take years for mortal hands to remove the tons of stone from the original roadway to make it passable once again. Thankfully, nature has changed the landscape for the better, and has opened a gap through the mountain to the north.

White barked birch trees populate the moist valleys that drain into the river to the southeast as the merchant road passes nearby. The tall vertical trees reach to the sky in a beautiful dance reminiscent of dancers waving their arms gracefully to some unheard rhythm. The grain-laden grasses sway in accompaniment, and the tinkling waterfalls and babbling creeks beat like odd syncopated patterns onto the rocks.

The merchant road passes through a small secluded valley. The soft cadence of rushing water echoes quietly down the vale where the rolling hills of the grasslands meets the sharper cliffs of the foothills. Riverlets and streams trickle down the rock faces adding harmony to a distant river's melody.

With the care and attention to detail rarely given to a mundane project such as a road, the engineers foresaw potential hazards and built the solutions into their finished project. Tracking the southern, downhill side of the road is a stone lined trough meant to solve any flooding or mud related issues.

Running parallel to the road is a smooth rock lined trench that channels the road's run-off during rainstorms. This flat part of the road that follows the valley floor would be prone to turn into a muddy bog and therefore a hazard to most caravans and their pack animals. Anticipating this event, the road's engineers built drains into the lower side of the road that carry the runoff into the culvert, which carries it harmlessly down to the low end of the valley.

Water loving trees hug the river's course through the low lying valley. Giant beech and huge alders vie for the valuable sodden shoreline and shade the understory bushes and ferns from direct sunlight. The result is a lushly green, verdant forest that obscures the river from the view on the road, though the hiss of rushing water reveals it's course.

The decaying remains of the bridge workers camp sprawls across this flat valley. To house their draft beasts, the workers constructed small stalls and shelters from rickety boards nailed quixotically to the standing trees. Three brass ring topped posts lie sunk into the grasslands turf, to the south, which was most likely used for tethering grazing animals. Between the posts is a rough stone trough that is filled automatically with water by a rickety mechanical wind mill, whirling lazily in the breeze.

Boulders stacked in pyramids contained by large timbers stand mutely to the side of the roadway next to an impromptu dump of broken tools, wooden stakes and empty buckets lined with mortar. Deeply grooved sled tracks lead to the east towards the bridge from this part of the road where the flatness of the valley was best suited for the staging area during the bridge's reconstruction. Smooth rectangles of tent foundations still mark their location in a semi circle around a blackened fire ring where the workers and their supervisors lived during it's rebuilding.

On the northern edge of the road stands a tall, flat rock. Chipped into the shape of a pillar and abraded to smoothness, it bears the stamped surveyor's mark of the road's builder. The mark's grooved letters are filled with sand and dust and obscured from age, but the arrows delineating north, south, east and west are clear and easy to read. The rest of the stamp is undecipherable and lends mystery to the road's origin.

A brown and white osprey soars above the raging river, scanning the water for a meal. Suddenly, it dives down to the surface and snatches a rather large trout from the water.

Withstanding seasonal floods and constant traffic, the durable road shows how affective good design and competent construction can be.

A massive stone bridge spans a raging grey tinted river as it runs it's course towards the southeast. The mud around the bridge footings has been churned by wheels of quarry wagons, tracks of sleds bearing block and tackle, shod hooves of draft beasts and booted feet of masons and bridge workers. The newer parts of the huge bridge are obvious due to the contrast in colors of mortar and rock. Bright banners snap briskly in the wind from both ends of the bridge.  A broken wooden wagon is here.

Mismatched mortar colors and varying types and cuts of the stone show the extent of the reconstruction made by quick working masons.

An enormous smooth round rock splits off a small eddy from the main current resulting a deep, clear pool by the eastern side of the road. The cool calm water catches the reflection of the white snowcapped mountain range further up the valley while the river rushes past towards Spur. Five fishermen recline on folding chairs or against rocks, tethered by the silvery lines of their poles to the fishing hole. Each fisherman is spread evenly around the pool as if held apart by some invisible barrier as they eye the large shadowy fish shapes finning effortlessly against the mild current in the eddy.

A marble statue of a Human, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a rosewood sign, a crisp gold lettered vellum notice, a flowing white marble fountain, and a shimmering marble statue of a Dragon are here.

In the area are Kinyo the Noble Frontacian, Natallia the Noble Frontacian, Aravinda the Frontacian, and Belaroius the Novice Human.

>[Town Square South.]

The outward appearance of the people here seems a bit classier. Rich clothing and large coin purses are prevalent amongst the travelers. In fact, many of the folk heading into Town Square from the south are accompanied by large bodyguards to assure their safety. The well maintained road is lined with small brass lanterns, each swinging off an individual pole.  A street lantern is here.

This area is illuminated.
You see the 1st busy townsman and the 1st slightly glowing city guardsman.
Obvious paths: north* northeast* east* south* west* northwest*.
[Southern Avenue.]

Smooth stones make up the street that leads from the center of Spur to the south. Each stone has been carefully fitted for the most comfortable travel by both cart and traveler alike. A well dressed Guard patrols the area in his dress uniform. Captains don't allow for slovenly appearances on this patrol.  A street lantern is here.

[Southern Avenue.]

Southern Avenue leads between the center of Spur and the homes of the prosperous and wealthy. Several of the Ladies of the city stroll along the avenue chatting about the current events and latest gossip of the Spur. Behind them, harried servants carry their reticules and all those belongings that they cannot be without.  A street lantern is here.

Vast estates tower over the huge Spurian wall towards the south. The well-to-do who live in these homes idle away their days, enjoying the luxury of time. Standing next to a very empty lantern pole, a small Flerian child insists in a plaintive wail, that he had nothing to do with the missing lantern. The well-dressed guard that interrogates him keeps pointing at a small sack on the ground and its obvious contents.  An open small burlap sack, a street lantern, and a lantern are here.

This area is illuminated.
You see the 1st city guard mage and the 2nd city guard mage.
Obvious paths: north* south*.
[Southern Avenue & Gorey Street.]

The boughs of a large apple tree hang over the well tended avenue. Below the beautiful tree stands a small fountain. Atop the fountain is an intricately carved Secian who appears to be dancing with the water as it splashes around her. Set in the marble base is a small plaque that reads, "For those who have gone before us." Many stand for a moment as they pass this way, giving thanks for the gift of life that is given by both the apple tree and the Secians of long ago. Large piles of dirt and broken stone lay on either side of the street as workmen ready the east and west alleys for expansion.  A street lantern, an open Secian etched moonsilver door, a pair of open silver forged swinging doors, and a sign above the doors are here.

A row of torches lines each wall, each mounted in an ornately crafted iron holder. The walls are constructed of expertly chiseled slabs of reddish granite, all having been carved with scenes of Hithual battles of yore. Each slab is trimmed by gold-flecked black granite. The ceiling is beautifully painted with a panoramic view of a great battlefield with hundreds of finely detailed warriors. You hear a group of rowdy Hithuals shout in unison "ALE!"  A highly polished dark walnut bar, lined with tankards is before you, a row of barstools in front of it. A number of large rocks have also been placed around as seats for those who prefer the feel of a mine. A long-bearded Hithual grins at you from behind the bar awaiting your order.   A highly polished dark walnut bar, a banner above the bar, a sign on the bar, a pair of closed silver forged swinging doors, and a closed gold-flecked black granite door are here.
