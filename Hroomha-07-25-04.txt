Illumination from the dim oil lamps barely cuts through spilt drink and stale tobacco scented air.  A group of drag-als that seem to have become a permanent fixture here beckons you to join them for a pitcher of ale, and motions to the bartender indicating that you're paying.  Without bothering to acknowledge them, the bartender flashes a toothless grin toward a crowd more likely to have a few coins in their pockets, points them toward a table in the back and offers them an etched wood menu.  An open finely carved rosewood door and a small stage are here.

>[Town Square Center.]

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.   A flowing white marble fountain, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a marble statue of a Human, a carved marble statue of a Dragon, a rosewood sign, a bronze battle-axe, an open ancient platinum box, and an open glittering platinum coffer are here.

Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.

                                    Visualization #1 is:
A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past. 

                                    Visualization #2 is:
A cool draft from the archway to the northwest hits you in the face. You hear voices murmuring, almost chanting, beyond the arch. A narrow stairway leads upward, providing an alternate exit from this room.

                                    Visualization #3 is:
Everything in this room has been colored green. This is where you will wait until it is your time to enter the arena. Food and drink have been placed on the tables to help you pass the time. A door leads into the arena and a portal leads back to the OOC Inn.

An arch between two large buildings connects Market Circle and Market Street. The more reputable shopkeepers do business within the circle, but pay higher taxes for the privilege. The buildings have been built to last, as these merchants are no traveling tinkers. Interlocking stone walkways and colorful plantings span this central area. Despite the number of animals waiting outside the bank for their owners, the area is spotless. Loud chatter in many languages can be heard from the southwest.

The buildings of Market Circle stand to the south. It becomes obvious that the area through the arch is a much cleaner marketplace than the bazaar. An inviting eatery stands beside the road, its door open to those weary after a long trip to Spur, as well as those preparing to venture to the great expanses beyond the west gate. A human couple exit the building, arm in arm. A small sign stands beside the intersection.  A sign, an open glossy lacquered oak door, and a street lantern are here.

Many townsfolk pass along this busy thoroughfare. Rich and poor alike mix freely on this street, much to the dismay of a passing nobleman.

High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.   A flowing white marble fountain, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a marble statue of a Human, a carved marble statue of a Dragon, a rosewood sign, a bronze battle-axe, an open ancient platinum box, an open glittering platinum coffer, and a bottle of fine anthian wine are here.

[Town Square South.]

The outward appearance of the people here seems a bit classier. Rich clothing and large coin purses are prevalent amongst the travelers. In fact, many of the folk heading into Town Square from the south are accompanied by large bodyguards to assure their safety. The well maintained road is lined with small brass lanterns, each swinging off an individual pole. No expense has been spared to keep those who travel this road safe from the hoodlums that relish the darkness.  A street lantern and some charred foliage are here.

Southern Avenue leads between the center of Spur and the homes of the prosperous and wealthy.

Vast estates tower over the huge Spurian wall towards the south. The well-to-do who live in these homes idle away their days, enjoying the luxury of time. Standing next to a very empty lantern pole, a small Flerian child insists in a plaintive wail, that he had nothing to do with the missing lantern. The well-dressed guard that interrogates him keeps pointing at a small sack on the ground and its obvious contents.  An open small burlap sack and a street lantern are here.

[Southern Avenue & Gorey Street.]

The boughs of a large apple tree hang over the well tended avenue. Below the beautiful tree stands a small fountain. Atop the fountain is an intricately carved Secian who appears to be dancing with the water as it splashes around her. Set in the marble base is a small plaque that reads, "For those who have gone before us." Many stand for a moment as they pass this way, giving thanks for the gift of life that is given by both the apple tree and the Secians of long ago. Large piles of dirt and broken stone lay on either side of the street as workmen ready the east and west alleys for expansion.  A street lantern, a Secian etched moonsilver door, a pair of open silver forged swinging doors, and a sign above the doors are here.

Standing next to the large iron gate that separates the center of town from those of the elite class are several of the Spurian Guard. They are here to assist all who pass with the simple kindness of opening a gate, or the more important task of escorting those in need to the bank or market. A young looking cadet rubs wax into the stones of the city wall, his task is daunting, but one that will teach him discipline.  An open iron gate and a street lantern are here.

An elegant, carved wooden sign hangs above the ornate gateway set into the massive wall that divides Spurs Noble District from the Town Square. You can make out city guardsmen peering down attentively at all that approach from their posts atop the imposing wall. They seem to take a greater interest in this part of town, though there does not seem to be anything threatening enough here to warrant such attention.

An unusually large home, even for this part of town, lies off to the west. It seems as if one ambitious owner is slowly buying up the lots next to his and adding them to his own. Groundskeepers are at work in the surrounding gardens, trimming and raking, so intent on their work they do not bother to acknowledge the passing traffic on the road.  A street lantern is here.

Many grand, even ostentatious, homes line this stretch of Noble Way. Most of the residents here were fortunate enough to be born into the right families.

Some of these names could almost be considered famous.  A street lantern is here.

Noble Way continues to wind its way among the rather modestly sized, but elegant, homes of the Spur's successful. Many a peasant farmer may live in homes larger than these, but none can match the quality found here. A peaceful, luxurious feeling pervades this part of town; perhaps it is the drifting floral scents wafting from the well-tended gardens.  A closed elegant black iron gate and a street lantern are here.

Gazing down each of the nearby private drives reveals a glimpse of a luxurious home, each a miniature estate in its own right.

Leaving the exceptionally wealthy estates of the Spurian nobility, Noble Way heads toward the Town Square to the northwest. Along the roadside can be seen the in-city homes of successful merchants and other wealthy citizens of the Spur. The homes display a slightly different style, perhaps they are not quite so restrained; a touch more exuberance and freedom with materials is displayed.  A street lantern is here.

The entire avenue is composed of fine cobblestone, each level with its neighbor, providing a smooth ride for passing carriages and horses.

Numerous trees lining the avenue serve as the dividing border between the majestic estates of the nobility and the lightly traveled roadway.

A small roadway bordered by flowering hedges bisects the wide avenue of Noble Way at a right angle, heading east to west.  A thick, sturdy sign stands just off to the side of a charming path, its large friendly letters intent on luring travelers into the city's premiere roadstay, the Gilded Lion Inn. The entrance is clearly marked and welcoming, extending off to the southeast.  A wooden sign and a street lantern are here.

Majestic elms continue to line this broad roadway, sheltering the avenue on both sides and further enhancing the grandiose atmosphere.

The occasional locked gate marks the entrance to some of the more hidden estates of Spurs nobility. From this broad avenue, little can be seen of their splendor. Behind the imposing gate recedes a proud drive, disappearing mysteriously into the trees. If not for the large imposing tower rising above the hedges it would be hard to discern anything was beyond the gate. It is apparent the residents do not wish to be disturbed.  A street lantern, a closed morbius door, and an open black iron gate are here.

Through the gate lies the city of Spur, the major center of trade and civilization on the plains. The dusty road leading through the gates is well traveled, and walls of the city are in good repair. A small shack sits to the west of the road, during most times of the day a dusty coach can be seen waiting in front, its horses stomping with impatience to be gone. To the right of the door is a small window, its opening covered with metal bars. An old man, missing most of his teeth, waits patiently for the travelers to pay their fare, and then directs them into the waiting area. On the east side of the road a billowing multicolored tent has been erected, the hustle and bustle of merchants and customers can be seen coming and going at all times of the day.  A rainbow silk tent and an open iron gate are here.

[Wilderness gate.]

Set within a wide tunnel leading through the hedge to the north is the Wilderness Gate. It separates the settled lands of Spur from the open plains to the south of the city. The plains stretch as far as the eyes can see, the horizon and the walls of the fort down the road the only blemishes of the grassy landscape in the distance. The stones of the road are smoothly set together, well built to withstand heavy travel. A broken wagon wheel, discarded some time ago, covers a spot of nearby grass, weeds trying to climb through the spokes.  Some glowing festive rainbow diamond lanterns are here.

[Southern Tradeway.]

The tradeway runs across the open grasslands northeast towards the Spur, and southwest towards distant lands and eventually, the coast. The plains to the south and east seem totally indifferent to your existence. Just ahead, a small path moves up a village of huts spread out in a semi-circle. In the center of the village a giant fire pit sits where barbarians who wander through the village can sit around to stay warm.  A worn grassy path and some glowing festive rainbow diamond lanterns are here.

[Southern Tradeway.]

The stone paved tradeway stretches across the open plains, interrupting nature's task of consuming the land. An endless sea of grass surrounds you, lapping at the road much like the tides against a beach. The faintly damp wind occasionally blowing in from the west smells of earth. Some of the stones in the road interlock together to form the crude image of a lion. There is no discerning if it was done on purpose or sheer accident.  Some glowing festive rainbow diamond lanterns are here.

[Southern Tradeway.]

Only the well-built, stone tradeway gives any hint of civilization ever having had any presence here. The tall grasses limit visibility nearby, hiding any wildlife that may be waiting for prey to stumble too close. A few blades of grass sway slightly in the breeze, some of them broken by the passing of something heavy over them. One of the larger stones in the road, broken loose from its mortar, waits patiently to be repaired.   Some glowing festive rainbow diamond lanterns are here.

The grass rises taller and taller in every direction further limiting view just off the roadside. A second glance reveals that this is the lowest point in a large, shallow depression. The tradeway sinks a little lower as it gets closer to the river off to the west. A ditch runs alongside the river's side of the road, small puddles of water filling the bottom. Trickles filter into the puddles from the grass beyond as mosquitoes dart across the muddy surfaces.  Some glowing festive rainbow diamond lanterns are here.

[Southern Tradeway.]

Rising up out of the plains, a large walled fort receives the end of the stone road. The river flows from either side, running through the fort from this angle of view. The vegetation surrounding the tradeway at this point has been burned out recently, allowing a clear field of vision from the tops of the walls ahead. The stones show little wear from the heavy traffic of feet and wheels alike; it has certainly been well constructed.  Some glowing festive rainbow diamond lanterns are here.

Two guards patrol above the gate, looking you over carefully before giving leave to pass through the heavy wood gate. Thick and long wooden ladders serve up to the guard's posts high in the sky so that they may have some relief from their duties overlooking the land and city. Through the slates of the wooden walkways, you can make out four archers playing a game of cards, weapons at the ready. A whip cracks loudly as a caravan heads out the gate towards Spur.  A glowing wrought iron lantern and some glowing festive rainbow diamond lanterns are here.

[Meetpoint, Leuian Festival.]

The sound of good cheer travels quickly on the otherwise heavy summer air, as a warm breeze rolls from the plains. Yellow, turquoise, purple, and white bunting drape loosely from wooden poles, forming a colorful collection of small tents. Winding from ten to tent, a narrow path ribbons itself. The path's outline is framed ornately by a mixture of tropical plants and flowers, reminiscent of Leuia, home sweet home. A colorful menagerie of individuals meander merrily as roars of laughter ring throughout the festival.  An open fragrant green and yellow tent flap, an open purple ribboned tent flap, an open wave patterned tent flap, and some glowing festive rainbow diamond lanterns are here.

[Leuian Festival, Fire Pit.]

As the trail from the festival grounds disappears, the long grass parts entering into a small clearing. The ground has been flattened and is well worn with pieces of metal and stone speckled throughout the dirt. A large pit has been dug into the center with a raging fire burning inside. The breeze picks up, rippling the grass and making the nearby tents seem to float on a sea of grass. Several large, well worn rocks rest around the fire pit, and piles of small animal bones and blackened skewers are scattered around.  An icy keg of Khatyr ale, some glowing festive rainbow diamond lanterns, an open tall steaming steel pot, a closed tall steaming steel pot, a closed flaming iron grill, an open icy barrel, a closed chilled bin, and an open icy barrel are here.

[Leuian Festival, Fire Pit.]

As the trail from the festival grounds disappears, the long grass parts entering into a small clearing. The ground has been flattened and is well worn with pieces of metal and stone speckled throughout the dirt. A large pit has been dug into the center with a raging fire burning inside. The breeze picks up, rippling the grass and making the nearby tents seem to float on a sea of grass. Several large, well worn rocks rest around the fire pit, and piles of small animal bones and blackened skewers are scattered around.  An icy keg of Khatyr ale, some glowing festive rainbow diamond lanterns, an open tall steaming steel pot, an open tall steaming steel pot, an open flaming iron grill, an open icy barrel, an open chilled bin, and an open icy barrel are here.

This area is illuminated.

[Leuian Festival, Fire Pit.]

As the trail from the festival grounds disappears, the long grass parts entering into a small clearing. The ground has been flattened and is well worn with pieces of metal and stone speckled throughout the dirt. A large pit has been dug into the center with a raging fire burning inside. The breeze picks up, rippling the grass and making the nearby tents seem to float on a sea of grass. Several large, well worn rocks rest around the fire pit, and piles of small animal bones and blackened skewers are scattered around.  An icy keg of Khatyr ale, some glowing festive rainbow diamond lanterns, an open tall steaming steel pot, an open tall steaming steel pot, an open flaming iron grill, an open icy barrel, an open chilled bin, an open icy barrel, a glass vial, a glass vial, a glass vial, a glass vial, a small flawless tiger's eye charm, a glass vial, a glass vial, and an open filthy doeskin sack are here.

[Meetpoint, Leuian Festival.]

The sound of good cheer travels quickly on the otherwise heavy summer air, as a warm breeze rolls from the plains. Yellow, turquoise, purple, and white bunting drape loosely from wooden poles, forming a colorful collection of small tents. Winding from ten to tent, a narrow path ribbons itself. The path's outline is framed ornately by a mixture of tropical plants and flowers, reminiscent of Leuia, home sweet home. A colorful menagerie of individuals meander merrily as roars of laughter ring throughout the festival.  An open fragrant green and yellow tent flap, an open purple ribboned tent flap, an open wave patterned tent flap, and some glowing festive rainbow diamond lanterns are here.

[Meetpoint.]

Two guards patrol above the gate, looking you over carefully before giving leave to pass through the heavy wood gate. Thick and long wooden ladders serve up to the guard's posts high in the sky so that they may have some relief from their duties overlooking the land and city. Through the slates of the wooden walkways, you can make out four archers playing a game of cards, weapons at the ready. A whip cracks loudly as a caravan heads out the gate towards Spur.  A glowing wrought iron lantern and some glowing festive rainbow diamond lanterns are here.

The tradeways path leads directly to the imposing north-eastern gate of a stately fort. Even from this distance, the sounds of commerce and progress ring loudly as the harnesses of trader wagons jingle along the busy roadway and saws buzz noisily.The tradeway is constantly full of traffic going in both directions.   Some glowing festive rainbow diamond lanterns are here.

[Southern Tradeway.]

Rising up out of the plains, a large walled fort receives the end of the stone road. The river flows from either side, running through the fort from this angle of view. The vegetation surrounding the tradeway at this point has been burned out recently, allowing a clear field of vision from the tops of the walls ahead. The stones show little wear from the heavy traffic of feet and wheels alike; it has certainly been well constructed.  Some glowing festive rainbow diamond lanterns are here.

The grass rises taller and taller in every direction further limiting view just off the roadside. A second glance reveals that this is the lowest point in a large, shallow depression. The tradeway sinks a little lower as it gets closer to the river off to the west. A ditch runs alongside the river's side of the road, small puddles of water filling the bottom. Trickles filter into the puddles from the grass beyond as mosquitoes dart across the muddy surfaces.  Some glowing festive rainbow diamond lanterns are here.

[Southern Tradeway.]

Only the well-built, stone tradeway gives any hint of civilization ever having had any presence here. The tall grasses limit visibility nearby, hiding any wildlife that may be waiting for prey to stumble too close. A few blades of grass sway slightly in the breeze, some of them broken by the passing of something heavy over them. One of the larger stones in the road, broken loose from its mortar, waits patiently to be repaired.   Some glowing festive rainbow diamond lanterns are here.

The stone paved tradeway stretches across the open plains, interrupting nature's task of consuming the land. An endless sea of grass surrounds you, lapping at the road much like the tides against a beach. The faintly damp wind occasionally blowing in from the west smells of earth. Some of the stones in the road interlock together to form the crude image of a lion. There is no discerning if it was done on purpose or sheer accident.  Some glowing festive rainbow diamond lanterns are here.

The tradeway runs across the open grasslands northeast towards the Spur, and southwest towards distant lands and eventually, the coast. The plains to the south and east seem totally indifferent to your existence. Just ahead, a small path moves up a village of huts spread out in a semi-circle. In the center of the village a giant fire pit sits where barbarians who wander through the village can sit around to stay warm.  A worn grassy path and some glowing festive rainbow diamond lanterns are here.

Set within a wide tunnel leading through the hedge to the north is the Wilderness Gate. It separates the settled lands of Spur from the open plains to the south of the city. The plains stretch as far as the eyes can see, the horizon and the walls of the fort down the road the only blemishes of the grassy landscape in the distance. The stones of the road are smoothly set together, well built to withstand heavy travel. A broken wagon wheel, discarded some time ago, covers a spot of nearby grass, weeds trying to climb through the spokes.  Some glowing festive rainbow diamond lanterns are here.

A small shack sits to the west of the road, during most times of the day a dusty coach can be seen waiting in front, its horses stomping with impatience to be gone. To the right of the door is a small window, its opening covered with metal bars. An old man, missing most of his teeth, waits patiently for the travelers to pay their fare, and then directs them into the waiting area. On the east side of the road a billowing multicolored tent has been erected, the hustle and bustle of merchants and customers can be seen coming and going at all times of the day.

A side-street heading off to the east leads to an extremely well kept neighborhood that easily surpasses everything around it in splendor and magnificence. Everything, even the carefully pruned trees and the manicured shrubbery displays a desire for elegant perfection.  A street lantern is here.

This area is illuminated.
You see the 1st raccoon (wearing a small gold collar).
In the area are Phannah the Noble Human (holding a glowing delicately engraved moonsilver lamp), Panick the Noble Drag-al, Jedaka the Novice Leuian, Tygraa the Noble Leuian, Dhameon the Human, Cleric the Noble Leuian, and Alihtim the Noble Hithual.

[Noble Way.]

Leaving the exceptionally wealthy estates of the Spurian nobility, Noble Way heads toward the Town Square to the northwest. Along the roadside can be seen the in-city homes of successful merchants and other wealthy citizens of the Spur. The homes display a slightly different style, perhaps they are not quite so restrained; a touch more exuberance and freedom with materials is displayed.  A street lantern is here.

Gazing down each of the nearby private drives reveals a glimpse of a luxurious home, each a miniature estate in its own right. Short, stout walls and manicured hedges serve to keep out the riffraff and to protect the small, expensive gardens. Every detail has been attended to display the exotic plants, in all their pampered perfection.  A street lantern and a closed rosewood door are here.

Noble Way continues to wind its way among the rather modestly sized, but elegant, homes of the Spur's successful. Many a peasant farmer may live in homes larger than these, but none can match the quality found here. A peaceful, luxurious feeling pervades this part of town; perhaps it is the drifting floral scents wafting from the well-tended gardens.  A closed elegant black iron gate and a street lantern are here.

Many grand, even ostentatious, homes line this stretch of Noble Way. Most of the residents here were fortunate enough to be born into the right families. Few that live in this area have ever actually had to work for a living. Glancing at the nameplates reveals many of the recognizable names of the Spur. Some of these names could almost be considered famous.  A street lantern is here.

An unusually large home, even for this part of town, lies off to the west. It seems as if one ambitious owner is slowly buying up the lots next to his and adding them to his own. Groundskeepers are at work in the surrounding gardens, trimming and raking, so intent on their work they do not bother to acknowledge the passing traffic on the road.  A street lantern is here.

To the north, you can make out an ornately scrolled gateway set in the base of the imposing city wall. The refined roadway of Noble Way stretches out to the south. The cobblestones of the road are smooth and even. The attention to detail shown here is a dramatic change from some of the other parts of the city.  A street lantern is here.

[Gateway.]

An elegant, carved wooden sign hangs above the ornate gateway set into the massive wall that divides Spurs Noble District from the Town Square. You can make out city guardsmen peering down attentively at all that approach from their posts atop the imposing wall. They seem to take a greater interest in this part of town, though there does not seem to be anything threatening enough here to warrant such attention.  A gilded silver plaque and a street lantern are here.

[Southern Avenue.]

Standing next to the large iron gate that separates the center of town from those of the elite class are several of the Spurian Guard. They are here to assist all who pass with the simple kindness of opening a gate, or the more important task of escorting those in need to the bank or market. A young looking cadet rubs wax into the stones of the city wall, his task is daunting, but one that will teach him discipline.  An open iron gate and a street lantern are here.

[Southern Avenue & Gorey Street.]

The boughs of a large apple tree hang over the well tended avenue. Below the beautiful tree stands a small fountain. Atop the fountain is an intricately carved Secian who appears to be dancing with the water as it splashes around her. Set in the marble base is a small plaque that reads, "For those who have gone before us." Many stand for a moment as they pass this way, giving thanks for the gift of life that is given by both the apple tree and the Secians of long ago. Large piles of dirt and broken stone lay on either side of the street as workmen ready the east and west alleys for expansion.  A street lantern, a Secian etched moonsilver door, a pair of open silver forged swinging doors, and a sign above the doors are here.

[Southern Avenue.]

Vast estates tower over the huge Spurian wall towards the south. The well-to-do who live in these homes idle away their days, enjoying the luxury of time. Standing next to a very empty lantern pole, a small Flerian child insists in a plaintive wail, that he had nothing to do with the missing lantern. The well-dressed guard that interrogates him keeps pointing at a small sack on the ground and its obvious contents.  An open small burlap sack and a street lantern are here.

Southern Avenue leads between the center of Spur and the homes of the prosperous and wealthy. Several of the Ladies of the city stroll along the avenue chatting about the current events and latest gossip of the Spur. Behind them, harried servants carry their reticules and all those belongings that they cannot be without.  A street lantern is here.

Smooth stones make up the street that leads from the center of Spur to the south. Each stone has been carefully fitted for the most comfortable travel by both cart and traveler alike.

[Town Square South.]

The outward appearance of the people here seems a bit classier. Rich clothing and large coin purses are prevalent amongst the travelers. In fact, many of the folk heading into Town Square from the south are accompanied by large bodyguards to assure their safety. The well maintained road is lined with small brass lanterns, each swinging off an individual pole. No expense has been spared to keep those who travel this road safe from the hoodlums that relish the darkness.  A street lantern and some charred foliage are here.

[Town Square Center.]

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.   A flowing white marble fountain, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a marble statue of a Human, a carved marble statue of a Dragon, a rosewood sign, a bronze battle-axe, an open ancient platinum box, an open glittering platinum coffer, some silver coins, and a bronze bastard sword are here.

[Town Square Center.]

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.   A flowing white marble fountain, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a marble statue of a Human, a carved marble statue of a Dragon, a rosewood sign, a bronze battle-axe, an open ancient platinum box, an open glittering platinum coffer, some silver coins, and a bronze bastard sword are here.

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.   A flowing white marble fountain, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a marble statue of a Human, a carved marble statue of a Dragon, and a rosewood sign are here.

[Town Square East.]

Travel to the eastern portion of Town Square finds battle clad warriors shoulder to shoulder with chained criminals and those who live outside the Spurian Walls. The cobblestones that line the street are stained with blood.  It is unknown as to whether the blood is from guards carrying out quick executions, or gladiators who refused to wait their turn for arena space.  A street lantern is here.

The outward appearance of the people here seems a bit classier. Rich clothing and large coin purses are prevalent amongst the travelers. In fact, many of the folk heading into Town Square from the south are accompanied by large bodyguards to assure their safety. The well maintained road is lined with small brass lanterns, each swinging off an individual pole. No expense has been spared to keep those who travel this road safe from the hoodlums that relish the darkness.  A street lantern and some charred foliage are here.

The large temple of Rinanni rises to the north, its white marble almost glowing in the light.  A street lantern is here.

[Town Square East.]

Travel to the eastern portion of Town Square finds battle clad warriors shoulder to shoulder with chained criminals and those who live outside the Spurian Walls. The cobblestones that line the street are stained with blood.  It is unknown as to whether the blood is from guards carrying out quick executions, or gladiators who refused to wait their turn for arena space.  A street lantern is here.

This area is illuminated.
You see the 1st ten-headed hydra, the 1st planar imp (wearing a small gold collar), and the 1st raccoon (wearing a small gold collar).
In the area are Equality the Noble Secian, Phannah the Noble Human (holding a glowing delicately engraved moonsilver lamp), Panick the Noble Drag-al, Quazzy the Leuian, Railt the Noble Penthanian (a planar imp upon his left shoulder), Thumpya the Drag-al, Nyoko the Drake, Vartac the Noble Secian, Dhameon the Human, Cleric the Noble Leuian (lying down), and Alihtim the Noble Hithual.

Travel to the eastern portion of Town Square finds battle clad warriors shoulder to shoulder with chained criminals and those who live outside the Spurian Walls. The cobblestones that line the street are stained with blood.  It is unknown as to whether the blood is from guards carrying out quick executions, or gladiators who refused to wait their turn for arena space.  A street lantern is here.

[Town Square East.]

Travel to the eastern portion of Town Square finds battle clad warriors shoulder to shoulder with chained criminals and those who live outside the Spurian Walls. The cobblestones that line the street are stained with blood.  It is unknown as to whether the blood is from guards carrying out quick executions, or gladiators who refused to wait their turn for arena space.  A street lantern is here.

This area is illuminated.
You see the 1st spectral sanene torturer corpse and the 1st planar imp (wearing a small gold collar).
In the area are Equality the Noble Secian, Panick the Noble Drag-al, Quazzy the Leuian, Railt the Noble Penthanian (a planar imp upon his left shoulder), Thumpya the Drag-al, Nyoko the Drake, Vartac the Noble Secian, Cleric the Noble Leuian (lying down), and Alihtim the Noble Hithual.

[Town Square South.]

The outward appearance of the people here seems a bit classier. Rich clothing and large coin purses are prevalent amongst the travelers. In fact, many of the folk heading into Town Square from the south are accompanied by large bodyguards to assure their safety. The well maintained road is lined with small brass lanterns, each swinging off an individual pole. No expense has been spared to keep those who travel this road safe from the hoodlums that relish the darkness.  A street lantern and some charred foliage are here.

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool.

The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.

In fact, many of the folk heading into Town Square from the south are accompanied by large bodyguards to assure their safety.

[Town Square Center.]

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.   A flowing white marble fountain, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a marble statue of a Human, a carved marble statue of a Dragon, and a rosewood sign are here.

Before you stands a magnificent white marble temple dedicated to Odarous, the god of chivalry. Ten giant steps made of the same gleaming marble lead up to the temple entrance. Two large statues stand at the base of the stairs, also carved of breath-taking marble. One is a warrior bearing a massive sword and a large shield. The other is a cleric with an amulet bearing the mark of Odarous in one hand and a large mace in the other.  Some gleaming white marble stairs, a polished white marble statue, a polished white marble statue, and a street lantern are here.

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.

The traffic on the northern street heading away from town square is an eclectic bunch.  Those who belong to the guilds to the north travel in packs on their way to and from guild events.  It is not unusual to see a group of armored fighters passing a group of robed clerics, each heading in the opposite direction. The large temple of Rinanni rises to the north, its white marble almost glowing in the light.  A street lantern is here.

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.   A flowing white marble fountain, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a marble statue of a Human, a carved marble statue of a Dragon, and a rosewood sign are here.

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.   A flowing white marble fountain, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a marble statue of a Human, a carved marble statue of a Dragon, and a rosewood sign are here.

[Town Square North.]

The traffic on the northern street heading away from town square is an eclectic bunch.  Those who belong to the guilds to the north travel in packs on their way to and from guild events.  It is not unusual to see a group of armored fighters passing a group of robed clerics, each heading in the opposite direction. The large temple of Rinanni rises to the north, its white marble almost glowing in the light.  A street lantern is here.

Two elegant buildings, one to the north and one to the west, stand on either side of a quickly degrading road. Nattily dressed patrons of the two establishments hurry to their destination, not pausing for fear of being robbed, or worse. To the northwest the houses steadily become more decrepit. A dark pallor of smoky air hangs heavily over the area.  A street lantern and a heavy mahogany door are here.

People carrying bundles stream in from the west and rapidly lose themselves in the large crowds moving about in the vast town square.

Giggling children dart around the slower moving folks rushing on their way to spend the silvers in their pockets.  A street lantern is here.

The outward appearance of the people here seems a bit classier. Rich clothing and large coin purses are prevalent amongst the travelers. In fact, many of the folk heading into Town Square from the south are accompanied by large bodyguards to assure their safety. The well maintained road is lined with small brass lanterns, each swinging off an individual pole. No expense has been spared to keep those who travel this road safe from the hoodlums that relish the darkness.  A street lantern and some charred foliage are here.

The elegant Hotel Royale towers above the street, its emerald door sparkling in the light. The patrons that stroll in and out are catered to, doors opened and closed for them, and baggage and packages carried by harried servants. The large Bank of Spur sits on the east side of the square. Its location close to the Royale is not a coincidence. A gold-trimmed door is proof of the success of this branch of the Spurian bank and those who run it.  An elegant gold-trimmed walnut door, open emerald steel door, and a street lantern are here.

Travel to the eastern portion of Town Square finds battle clad warriors shoulder to shoulder with chained criminals and those who live outside the Spurian Walls. The cobblestones that line the street are stained with blood.  It is unknown as to whether the blood is from guards carrying out quick executions, or gladiators who refused to wait their turn for arena space.  A street lantern is here.

Towards the east you can hear a low chanting combined with the murmur of deep discussion from those who visit the Psion Center.  A wooden sign, a street lantern, and an open sturdy wooden door are here.

[Town Square Center.]

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.   A flowing white marble fountain, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a marble statue of a Human, a carved marble statue of a Dragon, and a rosewood sign are here.

[Town Square North.]

The traffic on the northern street heading away from town square is an eclectic bunch.  Those who belong to the guilds to the north travel in packs on their way to and from guild events.  It is not unusual to see a group of armored fighters passing a group of robed clerics, each heading in the opposite direction. The large temple of Rinanni rises to the north, its white marble almost glowing in the light.  A street lantern is here.

[Town Square.]

Two elegant buildings, one to the north and one to the west, stand on either side of a quickly degrading road. Nattily dressed patrons of the two establishments hurry to their destination, not pausing for fear of being robbed, or worse. To the northwest the houses steadily become more decrepit. A dark pallor of smoky air hangs heavily over the area.  A street lantern and a heavy mahogany door are here.

This area is illuminated.

[Trade Way & Bazaar Path.]

A path to the north winds its way among various stalls and tents. Some specialty outlets can be found, provided one does not get lost in this maze known as the Bazaar. More permanent structures to the south suggest finer goods as well as increased security.  A street lantern is here.

This well-worn road separates the Bazaar to the north and Market Circle to the south. Only a Thugian could appreciate the layered odors of simmering foodstuffs and shoppers from the Bazaar.

The buildings of Market Circle stand to the south. It becomes obvious that the area through the arch is a much cleaner marketplace than the bazaar. An inviting eatery stands beside the road, its door open to those weary after a long trip to Spur, as well as those preparing to venture to the great expanses beyond the west gate. A human couple exit the building, arm in arm. A small sign stands beside the intersection.  A sign, an open glossy lacquered oak door, and a street lantern are here.

The throngs of travelers thicken as one heads east along Trade Way. An Anthian plays softly on a strange looking stringed instrument, her melodic voice filling the air. Judging by her clothing, and the number of silvers at her feet, she makes a fine living practicing her craft.  A street lantern is here.

Deep grey mists surround a strange pile of rubble that lies south of the road. Occasionally a priest clad in a simple grey robe will wander past the rubble and whisper a short prayer under his breath. The fence running around the rubble is well kept, but the gate which once allowed entrance to this Temple has been chained closed.  A grey iron chained gate, a pile of rubble, and a street lantern are here.

From the city gate to the west, Trade Way continues eastward towards the busy Merchant district, past Joyeusse's Shop. The air is thick with the scent of fresh flowers.

An open carved rosewood door and a street lantern are here.

[Gateway.]

The relative safety inside Spur is a comfort to those returning from the fields and mountains. To those leaving, a massive wall of defense around the city lies ahead. Archer towers beside the gate overlook the wall, offering a painful welcome to would-be invaders. Several guards on foot patrol pass and disappear behind a thick, bluesteel banded steelwood door.

[Spur Gateway.]

Travelers from Rathan to the northwest, and the Trade Route to the south, converge at Spur's west gate. Guards posted on the ground give those seeking to enter the city a cursory once-over. Their lack of interest shows that anyone approaching has already been observed from above for some time. A grate in the ground loosens mud from wagon wheels and hooves before they pass through the gate, helping to keep the streets of Spur fairly clean.  An open giant black iron gate, a giant green oak tree, a small blue pool, a thick oak grate over the pool, and a polished stone marker are here.

Oak trees surround you on every side reaching their leaves up to the sky in majestic splendor. Rising high above the rest of the oaks stands a massive tree, clearly hundreds of years older than those around it within this section of the forest. A small path curves around the base of the tree and enters what looks to be some sort of small clearing, you can see a few Elves dressed entirely in green walking within the clearing, though telling them from the forest is proving a difficult task. A small sign hangs above the path that reads, "Foresters Guild".  A giant green oak tree, a golden oak tree, a giant ancient oak tree, and a worn grassy path are here.

Lush grass grows up to the borders of a thick, dense forest that cloaks the hills to the west. The grasslands thin near the grove as the huge trees completely shade the ground, and are replaced by taller bushes and juniper trees. The contrast between the waving stalks on the flat vista and the dark leaves of almost vertical trees is striking.

A rickety criss-crossed rough beam fence pens the grazing of black and white cows whose ponderous forms are barely visible through the tall grass on either side of the road. To the north, the soft, undulating grassland floor of the wide valley succumbs to the rolling foothills, which in turn delineates the imposing outline of a vista-spanning mountain range. Many a traveler has witnessed this idyllic vantage point and has been drawn on to follow the road that travels into the heart of the mountains.

The road diverts around a small pool of murky water that lies to the north. A confusion of hoof prints muddies the shoreline where the placid bovines have come to water themselves. The pool is damned by a small hillock which allows no drainage so the pool remains stagnant. The mountains to the north reflect in perfectly upside-down symmetry on the still pond's surface, only wavering slightly in concentric circles to the deft touch of small insects.

Aged and splintered into the vague circular shape, a decaying wagon wheel is left to rot in the grass by the roadside. Their roots protectively sheltered from the weather, idiosyntric sprouts of taller grasses thrive haphazardly inside the wheel. Several tiny holes top small pyramids of sandy debris, where a few red fire ants scout their wagon-wheel domain for fodder.

As the road bends around a curve, ruts left by merchant's wagons cut so deeply into the mud that all wheeled vehicles are forced to follow the set path. Four loaded wagons of a merchants caravan stand idle as one larger than standard wagon skitters along the path. The buckboard's frame groans and strains to keep it inline while the driver attempts to negotiate the turn. Four dark maned, matched mules balk at the noise behind them, and stomp nervously over the deep ruts. The liveried caravan guards attempt to haul the mules forward, further adding to the mules stubborn refusal to move.

Debris from the trees' self-trimming mats the taller grasses into an impenetrable wall. The cypresses produce the necessary windbreak for the field to bear the heavy headed grain.

Just to the north, the roadway curves gently around a bend in a large river that flows towards the southeast. An enormous smooth round rock splits off a small eddy from the main current resulting a deep, clear pool by the eastern side of the road. The cool calm water catches the reflection of the white snowcapped mountain range further up the valley while the river rushes past towards Spur. Five fishermen recline on folding chairs or against rocks, tethered by the silvery lines of their poles to the fishing hole. Each fisherman is spread evenly around the pool as if held apart by some invisible barrier as they eye the large shadowy fish shapes finning effortlessly against the mild current in the eddy.

Withstanding seasonal floods and constant traffic, the durable road shows how affective good design and competent construction can be. It travels a hand paved berm straight to an imposing grey stone bridge to the southeast. The pilons of the bridge are cloaked in river mist as the raging river sweeps by. Only the brightness of the fluttering flags that top the spans stand out sharply.

A brown and white osprey soars above the raging river, scanning the water for a meal. Suddenly, it dives down to the surface and snatches a rather large trout from the water. The trout wriggles helplessly in the large birds grip as it is carried off to a nest of sticks and twigs high in the distant treetops.

On the northern edge of the road stands a tall, flat rock. Chipped into the shape of a pillar and abraded to smoothness, it bears the stamped surveyor's mark of the road's builder. The mark's grooved letters are filled with sand and dust and obscured from age, but the arrows delineating north, south, east and west are clear and easy to read. The rest of the stamp is undecipherable and lends mystery to the road's origin.

Boulders stacked in pyramids contained by large timbers stand mutely to the side of the roadway next to an impromptu dump of broken tools, wooden stakes and empty buckets lined with mortar. Deeply grooved sled tracks lead to the east towards the bridge from this part of the road where the flatness of the valley was best suited for the staging area during the bridge's reconstruction. Smooth rectangles of tent foundations still mark their location in a semi circle around a blackened fire ring where the workers and their supervisors lived during it's rebuilding.

The decaying remains of the bridge workers camp sprawls across this flat valley. To house their draft beasts, the workers constructed small stalls and shelters from rickety boards nailed quixotically to the standing trees. Three brass ring topped posts lie sunk into the grasslands turf, to the south, which was most likely used for tethering grazing animals. Between the posts is a rough stone trough that is filled automatically with water by a rickety mechanical wind mill, whirling lazily in the breeze.

Water loving trees hug the river's course through the low lying valley. Giant beech and huge alders vie for the valuable sodden shoreline and shade the understory bushes and ferns from direct sunlight. The result is a lushly green, verdant forest that obscures the river from the view on the road, though the hiss of rushing water reveals it's course.

Running parallel to the road is a smooth rock lined trench that channels the road's run-off during rainstorms. This flat part of the road that follows the valley floor would be prone to turn into a muddy bog and therefore a hazard to most caravans and their pack animals. Anticipating this event, the road's engineers built drains into the lower side of the road that carry the runoff into the culvert, which carries it harmlessly down to the low end of the valley.

White barked birch trees populate the moist valleys that drain into the river to the southeast as the merchant road passes nearby. The tall vertical trees reach to the sky in a beautiful dance reminiscent of dancers waving their arms gracefully to some unheard rhythm.

The roadway takes advantage of a cut in the hill to negotiate a tumbled cliff face. At the top of the hill is a high, flat, steppe grassland, and at the bottom is the edge of the open range. At one point, the road narrows to cross a small stream. Very little mud gathers in the shallows of the stream and the pebbles and rocks glitter like gold as the wagon wheels churn the gravel.

The merchant roads widens as it travels another grass swept plateau. The mountain range fills the northern skyline in stark detail. Huge snow capped peaks and rough faced cliffs are close enough to see the individual boulders, waterfalls, and haphazard game trails. Much higher up the great mountainsides a line where trees stop growing gives testament to the altitude. The air is cool.

The grassland plateau is embraced by a stand of dark green oak trees so thick that little light passes through the profusion of their many lobed leaves. The forest is ancient and the trunks of the trees bare witness to fires, lightning strikes and the attacks of insects. Large gout-like burls disfigure some of the wide, grey trunks which have grown quietly next to the road for hundreds of years.

The merchant road makes a wide turn as it passes through the thick oak forest. A tiny meadow with a murmuring creek is the only open spot in sight. Bright wildflowers and fragrant mosses crowd around a sparkling jewel of a pond while the huge oaks stand like sentinels around the edges. A spotted fawn and its doe-eyed mother drink cautiously, swishing their white edged tails quickly.

The merchant road follows a bumpy path through the oak forest. Each stately old tree has added a few feet to it's girth since the road was first surveyed and constructed hundreds of years ago. Their roots have plied across the road, upending it's hand laid foundation and hand pounded bed. Several large knees of the oak's roots have leveraged up the edges of the road, hindering all wagons' passage and threatening to break spokes and axles.

Flat, yellow capped mushrooms and rippled shelf fungi sprout from the fallen trees. The pleasant aroma of healthy decomposing leaves fills the air.

A brace of buck-toothed, adolescent marmots scramble for cover as the shrill cry of a hawk sounds further up the mountain.

Thicker stalked grasses grow here on this high plateau where the air is rarified and rain spills quickly down the small rocky gullies. A few staunch oaks grow alone or in groups of one or two, their roots exposed where they cling to the rocky soil for sustenance. Thin, scraggly junipers suck up what little moisture the soil does manage to hold. The merchant road placidly passes by, untouched by time in the dry environment.

Bright green trees and healthy bushes stand out sporadically on the dusty steppe. The little spring fed islands are surrounded by the blue-green grasses that thrive here. All manner of beasts are drawn to the springs and the protection they offer. Bright blue scrub jays chatter noisily among themselves as they dart and swerve in accomplished aerial feats pursuing their winged insect meals. A small herd of wary jackrabbits stop munching the grass to turn their white ears towards the merchant road. The nearest jack to the road stands on his hind legs and tests the air for any scent of their many predators.

Blending perfectly with the muted hues of the arid surroundings, a lone timber wolf stalks the outer edges of the grassland about a half a mile from the merchant road. The wolf's ears are perked to listen for the rustling of the bushy tailed jack rabbits that thrive in the prairie. The wolf lifts it nose to catch a scent, howls briefly and trots off towards the southeast to catch it's prey from downwind.

The rocky valley walls widen to the accommodate the splitting of the Tarath fault line. The Great Divide towers to the north beyond the fractured, broken badlands. Sheer, monolithic cliffs dropping for thousands of feet front the western edge of the mountains; their sharp, snow-capped peaks vaulting nearly vertically from the floor of the fault line valley. The merchant road bed is cracked and broken as it negotiates the larger twists and turns.

A short tremor suddenly rocks the cracked merchant road! A dusty pall sifts into the air from cracks in the ground and the shifting of gravel around the valley.  The tremor rolls through the canyon walls like a ripple, as if it were a linen sheet that was lifted and settled again. Pack animals and travelers alike stop momentarily and then hasten their pace as if to leave the quake behind them.

As the merchant road approaches the western end of the valley, the valley wall abruptly falls away to a sheer drop. Crumbling rock and dirt spill constantly into the deep abyss. Sections of the mountain have slid away into the valley and the merchant road has been rebuilt higher along the steeper sides of the mountain. The fault line of broken rocks continues its path of destruction to the west, skirted by the land-slide prone softer dirt.   A freshly uncovered crevice is here.

A treacherous dusty trail leads west along the shaky fault line from a fork in the main road. The original roadbed has fallen into the chasm years ago, leaving the merchants to their own wiles to ply the slippery slopes past the fault zone. Many attempts have failed at conquering the shifting dirt and rocks. Currently a bumpy trail skirts the bigger rocks and loose gravel.

Cutting across a wide debris path, the merchant road is barely discernible from the hemorrhage of slowly decaying mountain.  Small footprints track across the torpid river but disappear within hours. To the north, a landmark of sorts allows travelers a point from which to reconoiter their path. A mount of rocks that resembles the beak of a large bird marks the northern rim of the crater. Southbound traffic must rely on their wits to reach the badlands beyond the chasm.

High above the mountain base the roadway makes its climb toward the peak. Down below the cliff falls off suddenly into the valley.

Another massive boulder, black and melted, blocks any further passage toward the top of the mountain. Thick grey and white clouds hang heavily near the edge of the road, swirling ever so slightly in the breeze. There is no way to continue up the mountain except perhaps by climbing the sheer cliff wall. The clouds pulse slightly and gravitate toward the road surface, the sound of thunder rolling over the area.

[The Silver Strand.]

A ribbon of pure silver stretches out through the billowing clouds toward the peak of the mountain. Each step is like walking on soft carpeting but without any solid underfooting to hold one up. Any movement on the silver strand makes the surface flow like the waves on the ocean, rippling into the distance.

The strand twists and stretches and in some parts is not entirely there. Large holes open and close on its surface but without fail passage over these rifts is made without any problems. Above and surrounding the strand, the billowing clouds make up the walls of a silky tunnel, flickering with light and the sounds of rolling thunder every so often. The tunnel leads east to a solid mountain roadway and west into a blur.

The strand and tunnel end abruptly before you, dispersing in the strong wind that blows down from the mountain.

[Sky.]

There is nothing here but the open expanse of sky. A silvery walkway ends quite close to the east, its semi-solid footing welcome to most who cannot fly. Far northeast another part of the strand waits for a traveler to set foot on its surface to continue the journey up the mountain. A strong wind blows down from the mountain peak, attempting to bring the massive drop to the ground quickly and painfully to anyone stupid enough to wander out into the sky.

Nothing but sky and mountains stretch out on all sides. The drop from this height would surely be deadly to anyone. A sliver of silver glints in the distance, rolling slightly within a wall of clouds. To the northeast, as if floating in the sky, a large tower hovers under it's own power. A small white curl of smoke reaches out from the tower towards the small silver path.  Some alabaster upwards leading stairs are here.

Powerful magickal energy flashes through the air every so often, the reddish-blue bolts dancing off the walls, ceiling and floor. An odd Thugian sized box rests against the rear wall; piles of crystal, drathain and granite dust lie on the floor.  A glowing white archway is here.

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.   A flowing white marble fountain, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a marble statue of a Human, a carved marble statue of a Dragon, a rosewood sign, an open blackened bronze coffer, an open stainless steel coffer, an open painted gold coffer, an open gold-trimmed titanium box, an open blackened brass box, an open scorched bronze box, an open rusting gold box, and a damaged smooth pommeled carbide long sword are here.

Phannah nods at Panick stiffly.

Dhameon says to Stanrar, "I'm going."

Panick nuzzles Phannah as best she can.

Serendipity reveals herself.

Serendipity grunts crouching down momentarily. Large ungainly golden-topped blackened wings slowly unfold preparing for flight.

[Town Square.]

Two elegant buildings, one to the north and one to the west, stand on either side of a quickly degrading road. Nattily dressed patrons of the two establishments hurry to their destination, not pausing for fear of being robbed, or worse. To the northwest the houses steadily become more decrepit. A dark pallor of smoky air hangs heavily over the area.  A street lantern and a heavy mahogany door are here.

This area is illuminated.
In the area are Haberthan the Hithual, Phannah the Noble Penthanian, Muthulas the Leuian, Ying the Drake, Ceresina the Noble Secian, Rev the Noble Hithual, Cleric the Noble Leuian, Anyah the Human (holding a lantern), Noffbrau the Noble Hithual, Vartac the Noble Secian, and Dhameon the Human (holding a flaming star of Psycia patterned cigarette).

[HOD Agent.]

You have entered the somber insurance headquarters of the House of the Dead. Richly appointed furnishings indicate that these services are refused by few. An elegant sign over a massive desk details available services. The presence of some inexplicable power sets your nerves on end. This is no place for hostility.   A wooden sign, a pitch black portal, and a pitch black portal are here.

[Trade Way & Bazaar Path.]

A path to the north winds its way among various stalls and tents. Some specialty outlets can be found, provided one does not get lost in this maze known as the Bazaar. More permanent structures to the south suggest finer goods as well as increased security.  A street lantern is here.

[Trade Way.]

This well-worn road separates the Bazaar to the north and Market Circle to the south. Only a Thugian could appreciate the layered odors of simmering foodstuffs and shoppers from the Bazaar. Crowds of people push past, some brushing against you. It might be a good idea to keep an eye on your coinpurse.  A street lantern is here.

[Trade & Market.]

The buildings of Market Circle stand to the south. It becomes obvious that the area through the arch is a much cleaner marketplace than the bazaar. An inviting eatery stands beside the road, its door open to those weary after a long trip to Spur, as well as those preparing to venture to the great expanses beyond the west gate. A human couple exit the building, arm in arm. A small sign stands beside the intersection.  A sign, an open glossy lacquered oak door, and a street lantern are here.

[Trade Way.]

The throngs of travelers thicken as one heads east along Trade Way. An Anthian plays softly on a strange looking stringed instrument, her melodic voice filling the air. Judging by her clothing, and the number of silvers at her feet, she makes a fine living practicing her craft.  A street lantern is here.

You follow Dhameon west...

[Trade Way.]

Deep grey mists surround a strange pile of rubble that lies south of the road. Occasionally a priest clad in a simple grey robe will wander past the rubble and whisper a short prayer under his breath. The fence running around the rubble is well kept, but the gate which once allowed entrance to this Temple has been chained closed.  A grey iron chained gate, a pile of rubble, and a street lantern are here.

[Trade Way.]

From the city gate to the west, Trade Way continues eastward towards the busy Merchant district, past Joyeusse's Shop. The air is thick with the scent of fresh flowers. Wagons filled with goods bound for sale trundle past, their drivers hopeful of the anticipated profits. Eager young warriors venture towards the west gate and the dangers beyond.  An open carved rosewood door and a street lantern are here.

[Gateway.]

The relative safety inside Spur is a comfort to those returning from the fields and mountains. To those leaving, a massive wall of defense around the city lies ahead. Archer towers beside the gate overlook the wall, offering a painful welcome to would-be invaders. Several guards on foot patrol pass and disappear behind a thick, bluesteel banded steelwood door. Wall road stretches to the south, a wide passage between the city wall and several large buildings.  An open iron gate, an open thick stone door, and a street lantern are here.

[Spur Gateway.]

Travelers from Rathan to the northwest, and the Trade Route to the south, converge at Spur's west gate. Guards posted on the ground give those seeking to enter the city a cursory once-over. Their lack of interest shows that anyone approaching has already been observed from above for some time. A grate in the ground loosens mud from wagon wheels and hooves before they pass through the gate, helping to keep the streets of Spur fairly clean.  An open giant black iron gate, a giant green oak tree, a small blue pool, a thick oak grate over the pool, and a polished stone marker are here.

Oak trees surround you on every side reaching their leaves up to the sky in majestic splendor. Rising high above the rest of the oaks stands a massive tree, clearly hundreds of years older than those around it within this section of the forest. A small path curves around the base of the tree and enters what looks to be some sort of small clearing, you can see a few Elves dressed entirely in green walking within the clearing, though telling them from the forest is proving a difficult task. A small sign hangs above the path that reads, "Foresters Guild".  A giant green oak tree, a golden oak tree, a giant ancient oak tree, and a worn grassy path are here.

Lush grass grows up to the borders of a thick, dense forest that cloaks the hills to the west. The grasslands thin near the grove as the huge trees completely shade the ground, and are replaced by taller bushes and juniper trees. The contrast between the waving stalks on the flat vista and the dark leaves of almost vertical trees is striking.

From the west spans a dark green forest of Sycamore and Beech trees that soak in the moister parts of the lower river valley. The tall, shaded forest breaks like a green tinged wave upon the tranquil calm of the grasslands. The huge trees within are ancient, reaching hundreds of feet into the air. As if steaming from a great cauldron, a heavy ground fog seeps from deep within the forest carrying with it the fresh smell of decomposing green matter.

A rickety criss-crossed rough beam fence pens the grazing of black and white cows whose ponderous forms are barely visible through the tall grass on either side of the road. To the north, the soft, undulating grassland floor of the wide valley succumbs to the rolling foothills, which in turn delineates the imposing outline of a vista-spanning mountain range. Many a traveler has witnessed this idyllic vantage point and has been drawn on to follow the road that travels into the heart of the mountains.

The road diverts around a small pool of murky water that lies to the north. A confusion of hoof prints muddies the shoreline where the placid bovines have come to water themselves. The pool is damned by a small hillock which allows no drainage so the pool remains stagnant. The mountains to the north reflect in perfectly upside-down symmetry on the still pond's surface, only wavering slightly in concentric circles to the deft touch of small insects.

Aged and splintered into the vague circular shape, a decaying wagon wheel is left to rot in the grass by the roadside. Their roots protectively sheltered from the weather, idiosyntric sprouts of taller grasses thrive haphazardly inside the wheel. Several tiny holes top small pyramids of sandy debris, where a few red fire ants scout their wagon-wheel domain for fodder.

As the road bends around a curve, ruts left by merchant's wagons cut so deeply into the mud that all wheeled vehicles are forced to follow the set path. Four loaded wagons of a merchants caravan stand idle as one larger than standard wagon skitters along the path. The buckboard's frame groans and strains to keep it inline while the driver attempts to negotiate the turn. Four dark maned, matched mules balk at the noise behind them, and stomp nervously over the deep ruts. The liveried caravan guards attempt to haul the mules forward, further adding to the mules stubborn refusal to move.

The road charges across a flat valley through waving stalks of grain with coppery tinted seeds. Around the northern edge grows a row of huge cypress trees with trunks that measure eight feet across. Debris from the trees' self-trimming mats the taller grasses into an impenetrable wall. The cypresses produce the necessary windbreak for the field to bear the heavy headed grain.

Broadening to fill the lee of a wide valley, the roadway passes by several temporary campsites where caravans have bolstered the existing comforts for their temporary encampments. Neat stacks of foraged sticks and axe-hewn firewood sit adjacent to the blackened rocks of two impromptu fire rings. Freshly dug midden pits waft clues to the camp's frequent use into the clean mountain air.

Empty wooden crates, broken harnesses, damaged pottery, and the usual byproducts of food preparation fill an impromptu refuse pile adjacent to two campsites.

Just to the north, the roadway curves gently around a bend in a large river that flows towards the southeast. An enormous smooth round rock splits off a small eddy from the main current resulting a deep, clear pool by the eastern side of the road. The cool calm water catches the reflection of the white snowcapped mountain range further up the valley while the river rushes past towards Spur. Five fishermen recline on folding chairs or against rocks, tethered by the silvery lines of their poles to the fishing hole. Each fisherman is spread evenly around the pool as if held apart by some invisible barrier as they eye the large shadowy fish shapes finning effortlessly against the mild current in the eddy.

The decaying remains of the bridge workers camp sprawls across this flat valley. To house their draft beasts, the workers constructed small stalls and shelters from rickety boards nailed quixotically to the standing trees. Three brass ring topped posts lie sunk into the grasslands turf, to the south, which was most likely used for tethering grazing animals. Between the posts is a rough stone trough that is filled automatically with water by a rickety mechanical wind mill, whirling lazily in the breeze.

Running parallel to the road is a smooth rock lined trench that channels the road's run-off during rainstorms. This flat part of the road that follows the valley floor would be prone to turn into a muddy bog and therefore a hazard to most caravans and their pack animals. Anticipating this event, the road's engineers built drains into the lower side of the road that carry the runoff into the culvert, which carries it harmlessly down to the low end of the valley.

White barked birch trees populate the moist valleys that drain into the river to the southeast as the merchant road passes nearby. The tall vertical trees reach to the sky in a beautiful dance reminiscent of dancers waving their arms gracefully to some unheard rhythm. The grain-laden grasses sway in accompaniment, and the tinkling waterfalls and babbling creeks beat like odd syncopated patterns onto the rocks.

The roadway takes advantage of a cut in the hill to negotiate a tumbled cliff face. At the top of the hill is a high, flat, steppe grassland, and at the bottom is the edge of the open range. At one point, the road narrows to cross a small stream. Very little mud gathers in the shallows of the stream and the pebbles and rocks glitter like gold as the wagon wheels churn the gravel.

The merchant roads widens as it travels another grass swept plateau. The mountain range fills the northern skyline in stark detail. Huge snow capped peaks and rough faced cliffs are close enough to see the individual boulders, waterfalls, and haphazard game trails. Much higher up the great mountainsides a line where trees stop growing gives testament to the altitude. The air is cool.

The grassland plateau is embraced by a stand of dark green oak trees so thick that little light passes through the profusion of their many lobed leaves. The forest is ancient and the trunks of the trees bare witness to fires, lightning strikes and the attacks of insects. Large gout-like burls disfigure some of the wide, grey trunks which have grown quietly next to the road for hundreds of years.

Crunching loudly on the road is a ankle high deposit of acorn hulls and their discarded caps. Quick footed grey squirrels dash across the road, or above on the high intertwined branches of the stately oaks, with the highly coveted acorns grasped firmly in their teeth. The squirrels flash their tails at each other in some unknown signal as traffic passes on the road.  A pile of empty acorn caps is here.

The merchant road makes a wide turn as it passes through the thick oak forest. A tiny meadow with a murmuring creek is the only open spot in sight. Bright wildflowers and fragrant mosses crowd around a sparkling jewel of a pond while the huge oaks stand like sentinels around the edges. A spotted fawn and its doe-eyed mother drink cautiously, swishing their white edged tails quickly.

The merchant road follows a bumpy path through the oak forest. Each stately old tree has added a few feet to it's girth since the road was first surveyed and constructed hundreds of years ago. Their roots have plied across the road, upending it's hand laid foundation and hand pounded bed. Several large knees of the oak's roots have leveraged up the edges of the road, hindering all wagons' passage and threatening to break spokes and axles.

Off to the side of the road, perhaps a hundred feet away, stands an enormous tree that commands the attention of all who pass this direction.

Flat, yellow capped mushrooms and rippled shelf fungi sprout from the fallen trees. The pleasant aroma of healthy decomposing leaves fills the air.

Dead fall and broken branches cover the hollow and is home for a family of thick furred marmots. The dark brown colored rodents stare out of the dark recesses of the dead branches with shiny black eyes. A brace of buck-toothed, adolescent marmots scramble for cover as the shrill cry of a hawk sounds further up the mountain.

A few staunch oaks grow alone or in groups of one or two, their roots exposed where they cling to the rocky soil for sustenance.

Bright green trees and healthy bushes stand out sporadically on the dusty steppe. The little spring fed islands are surrounded by the blue-green grasses that thrive here. All manner of beasts are drawn to the springs and the protection they offer. Bright blue scrub jays chatter noisily among themselves as they dart and swerve in accomplished aerial feats pursuing their winged insect meals. A small herd of wary jackrabbits stop munching the grass to turn their white ears towards the merchant road. The nearest jack to the road stands on his hind legs and tests the air for any scent of their many predators.

A sharp splash in the calm pool sends ripples down the stream and echoes off the narrow valley's walls.  The soft shush of slithering scales brushing against bushes and trees warns of an impending confrontation with the villages inhabitants. Three large male lizardmen duck out of one of the mud hovels doorway and sprint into hiding.

The merchant road follows the wandering path of the small stream. Towering pine trees grow thickly in this hidden forest.  Delicate, ground hugging ferns, thorny brambles with glossy leaves, and mountain laurels grow densely along the vale in the light shade of the pines. Bright green mosses cover the stream bank as the sluggish water ebbs to the southeast.

What is a well engineered road in the tamer steppe-lands becomes a minor miracle through the rougher hills and valleys. The road bed remains flat and easy to travel despite the rocky terrain. Each incline and decline in the road is fixed to an agreeable grade for most wagons and sleds.

The merchant road threads through bottom of the small, narrow valley. Sheer granite walls block the view from the well traveled road to either side and above, only a narrow ray of sky testifies to the time of day. The engineers set a route as far as possible from the broken stones in the center of the valley and, by luck or design, this foresight has saved the road-bed from constant reconstruction. Small cracks run parallel to the road, but none have broken through the thick layers of sand and stone.

The footing here seems a bit unstable. As you continue on your journey, you wonder what this land was like before the mining began. Something seems to glint in the sunlight on the northern horizon.  A large pile of rocks is here.

Rough granite walls rise above you to the east and west. The area here is a bit rougher and seems to have been recently mined. Large veins of silver can be seen. Up overhead, on the western face of the gorge wall a large crack has appeared. Though large enough to fit a Thugian, the only thing exiting the crack is a steady stream of dripping water.

You stand before a granite wall and large double gated doors. The walls are thick and finely crafted, and there seems to be a rather aged look about them.  The Gate is made of massive slabs of silver, while off to the left and right are the fort's impressive walls, able to withstand a rather large invasion or army if need be.  An open silver-trimmed black drathain gate is here.

This newly constructed road begins the climb to the mountain peaks as a vein from the main Rathan-Fort Tarath artery. Following the steep incline of the mountain's side, this twisting path travels its way to the opposite side of the City of Rathan. High above in that part of the mountain, a single silver-spired tower peaks through the misty mountain air and glistens slightly.

Small shrubs cling to the mountain side above the roadway, helping to sway the effects of erosion and the buffeting winds.

The strand widens toward the base of the tower, its silver-black surface reflecting the purple light from the walls. The tower is now completely in view, its walls not just glowing purple, but made of some sort of deep purple crystal magickally infused with a glowing light. There is but a single entrance gate and one narrow window slit high above the ground noticeable with a first glance. The silver spire hums slightly giving off a beautiful tune.

This area is illuminated.
In the area are Haberthan the Hithual, Phannah the Noble Penthanian, Ceresina the Noble Secian, Cleric the Noble Leuian, Anyah the Human (holding a lantern), Vartac the Noble Secian (holding a glowing opal tipped ebony staff of mages), and Dhameon the Human (holding a flaming star of Psycia patterned cigarette).

[The Crystal Tower.]

A massive purple crystal tower soars overhead, its silver spire polished to a bright shine. The walls pulse slightly as if beating like a massive heart. The mountain peak rises high on either side of the building, cradling the tower in its grasp. A massive gate protects the tower interior from any who do not belong.   An open silver-trimmed purple crystal gate is here.

Powerful magickal energy flashes through the air every so often, the reddish-blue bolts dancing off the walls, ceiling and floor.

Powerful magickal energy flashes through the air every so often, the reddish-blue bolts dancing off the walls, ceiling and floor. An odd Thugian sized box rests against the rear wall; piles of crystal, drathain and granite dust lie on the floor.  A glowing white archway and a broken brilliant purple crystal shard are here.

Several figures in flowing robes are standing around the door to one of the few new buildings in the poor quarter, seemingly sizing up everyone who passes by. You feel chills running down your spine as they start coldly staring at you. You feel distinctly unwelcome.   An open thick oak door is here.

Dismal Lane continues on a crooked path north and south. A side street branches to the west and is quickly lost in the shadows. A ramshack looking building that seems to be almost leaning sideways stands out on the corner, a small dented sign hangs from above the swinging wooden doors that reads, "Tarnished Tankard Tavern and Inn". From the look of the patrons milling around outside, this is anything but a high class establishment.  A pair of broken swinging wooden doors are here.

Dismal Lane meanders between old decrepit buildings. Some appear to be uninhabited with windows and doors boarded over. Others show signs of life, but are in little better state of repair. Canvas covers broken windows, and doors hang loosely on broken hinges. A gang of young Thugians are picking on a human child, pushing him back and forth. There is neither fear nor anger on the child's face, only dull, apathetic acceptance.  An open blue door and a scented lilac tree are here.

An eagle-emblazoned hostel and a large school house stand out amidst the broken down houses. A small group of children gather around an adolescent boy with the face of an old man. He smirks at the children on their way to school, while his followers openly taunt them. A teacher takes a step toward the boy as if to shoo him away, but thinks better of it and retreats back into the school.  An open door and an open schoolhouse door are here.

The broken and shattered remains of the Temple of Set litter the road and the spot where the temple once stood. Beggars and poor folk stand staring forlornly at the remains. A few make their way through the broken gate, some crying and some showing no emotion at all. Offerings to Set have been placed all around and litter the area.  A broken wooden gate and some stairs are here.

A large section of buildings on the west side of the street is now gone. The constant noises of construction and demolition pound away at all hours. The street is immaculately clean save the tons of stones piled along the poor quarter wall. The street stones extend westward, paving the beginnings of a large square shaped area.  A pile of stones is here.

Low Street ends at a gate that stands permanently ajar, its mechanism jammed and broken.

Potholes and cracks in the road impede travel on this portion of Low Street. Maintenance is not considered a priority, due to the roads distance from the center of the city. Unimpeded by the poor condition of the street, several people gather around a nearby newsstand, reading the latest issue of the Spurian Free Press and discussing politics. Across the street from the newsstand a sign next to a weathered brown wooden door reads, "Spurian Free Press" in large, bold letters.   A street lantern, an open weathered brown wooden door, and a wooden newsstand are here.

A beggar lies in a large pile of trash snoring deeply. His clothing is torn, filthy dirty, and a strong smell of alcohol wafts off of him.

Low Street is the thoroughfare that carries people to the northwestern portion of Spur. The traffic along this road leans towards those without any viable economic means. Women who look older then their years, crippled old men and darkly clad shadowy figures all move stoically towards their destination. Only the plodding of worn shoes breaks the dismal silence.  A street lantern is here.

A darkly clad hoodlum leans against a worn street sign. He eyes those who pass by very carefully and then makes a few gestures into the shadows.

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.   A flowing white marble fountain, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a marble statue of a Human, a carved marble statue of a Dragon, and a rosewood sign are here.

The relative safety inside Spur is a comfort to those returning from the fields and mountains. To those leaving, a massive wall of defense around the city lies ahead. Archer towers beside the gate overlook the wall, offering a painful welcome to would-be invaders. Several guards on foot patrol pass and disappear behind a thick, bluesteel banded steelwood door. Wall road stretches to the south, a wide passage between the city wall and several large buildings.  An open iron gate, an open thick stone door, and a street lantern are here.

[Spur Gateway.]

Travelers from Rathan to the northwest, and the Trade Route to the south, converge at Spur's west gate. Guards posted on the ground give those seeking to enter the city a cursory once-over. Their lack of interest shows that anyone approaching has already been observed from above for some time. A grate in the ground loosens mud from wagon wheels and hooves before they pass through the gate, helping to keep the streets of Spur fairly clean.  An open giant black iron gate, a giant green oak tree, a small blue pool, a thick oak grate over the pool, and a polished stone marker are here.

The path is flanked by countless tall oaks, swaying peacefully in the wind. They do their best to hide the sky from view, making it hard to tell night from day at times.

In the dusty distance, Spur's great wall demarks the southern end of this well-traveled merchant's road. Soaring majestically to the north stands the spiky pinnacles and snow topped peaks of an epic mountain range so immense that it separates lands, races, and cultures. Connecting the two is a merchant road built long ago.

Lush grass grows up to the borders of a thick, dense forest that cloaks the hills to the west. The grasslands thin near the grove as the huge trees completely shade the ground, and are replaced by taller bushes and juniper trees.

From the west spans a dark green forest of Sycamore and Beech trees that soak in the moister parts of the lower river valley. The tall, shaded forest breaks like a green tinged wave upon the tranquil calm of the grasslands. The huge trees within are ancient, reaching hundreds of feet into the air. As if steaming from a great cauldron, a heavy ground fog seeps from deep within the forest carrying with it the fresh smell of decomposing green matter.

A rickety criss-crossed rough beam fence pens the grazing of black and white cows whose ponderous forms are barely visible through the tall grass on either side of the road. To the north, the soft, undulating grassland floor of the wide valley succumbs to the rolling foothills, which in turn delineates the imposing outline of a vista-spanning mountain range. Many a traveler has witnessed this idyllic vantage point and has been drawn on to follow the road that travels into the heart of the mountains.

The road diverts around a small pool of murky water that lies to the north. A confusion of hoof prints muddies the shoreline where the placid bovines have come to water themselves. The pool is damned by a small hillock which allows no drainage so the pool remains stagnant. The mountains to the north reflect in perfectly upside-down symmetry on the still pond's surface, only wavering slightly in concentric circles to the deft touch of small insects.

Aged and splintered into the vague circular shape, a decaying wagon wheel is left to rot in the grass by the roadside. Their roots protectively sheltered from the weather, idiosyntric sprouts of taller grasses thrive haphazardly inside the wheel. Several tiny holes top small pyramids of sandy debris, where a few red fire ants scout their wagon-wheel domain for fodder.

As the road bends around a curve, ruts left by merchant's wagons cut so deeply into the mud that all wheeled vehicles are forced to follow the set path. Four loaded wagons of a merchants caravan stand idle as one larger than standard wagon skitters along the path. The buckboard's frame groans and strains to keep it inline while the driver attempts to negotiate the turn. Four dark maned, matched mules balk at the noise behind them, and stomp nervously over the deep ruts. The liveried caravan guards attempt to haul the mules forward, further adding to the mules stubborn refusal to move.

Just to the north, the roadway curves gently around a bend in a large river that flows towards the southeast. An enormous smooth round rock splits off a small eddy from the main current resulting a deep, clear pool by the eastern side of the road. The cool calm water catches the reflection of the white snowcapped mountain range further up the valley while the river rushes past towards Spur. Five fishermen recline on folding chairs or against rocks, tethered by the silvery lines of their poles to the fishing hole. Each fisherman is spread evenly around the pool as if held apart by some invisible barrier as they eye the large shadowy fish shapes finning effortlessly against the mild current in the eddy.

The decaying remains of the bridge workers camp sprawls across this flat valley. To house their draft beasts, the workers constructed small stalls and shelters from rickety boards nailed quixotically to the standing trees. Three brass ring topped posts lie sunk into the grasslands turf, to the south, which was most likely used for tethering grazing animals. Between the posts is a rough stone trough that is filled automatically with water by a rickety mechanical wind mill, whirling lazily in the breeze.

Running parallel to the road is a smooth rock lined trench that channels the road's run-off during rainstorms. This flat part of the road that follows the valley floor would be prone to turn into a muddy bog and therefore a hazard to most caravans and their pack animals. Anticipating this event, the road's engineers built drains into the lower side of the road that carry the runoff into the culvert, which carries it harmlessly down to the low end of the valley.

The grassland plateau is embraced by a stand of dark green oak trees so thick that little light passes through the profusion of their many lobed leaves. The forest is ancient and the trunks of the trees bare witness to fires, lightning strikes and the attacks of insects. Large gout-like burls disfigure some of the wide, grey trunks which have grown quietly next to the road for hundreds of years.

Crunching loudly on the road is a ankle high deposit of acorn hulls and their discarded caps. Quick footed grey squirrels dash across the road, or above on the high intertwined branches of the stately oaks, with the highly coveted acorns grasped firmly in their teeth. The squirrels flash their tails at each other in some unknown signal as traffic passes on the road.  A pile of empty acorn caps is here.

The merchant road makes a wide turn as it passes through the thick oak forest. A tiny meadow with a murmuring creek is the only open spot in sight. Bright wildflowers and fragrant mosses crowd around a sparkling jewel of a pond while the huge oaks stand like sentinels around the edges. A spotted fawn and its doe-eyed mother drink cautiously, swishing their white edged tails quickly.

The merchant road follows a bumpy path through the oak forest. Each stately old tree has added a few feet to it's girth since the road was first surveyed and constructed hundreds of years ago. Their roots have plied across the road, upending it's hand laid foundation and hand pounded bed. Several large knees of the oak's roots have leveraged up the edges of the road, hindering all wagons' passage and threatening to break spokes and axles.

Off to the side of the road, perhaps a hundred feet away, stands an enormous tree that commands the attention of all who pass this direction. It's offspring populate the plateau for miles in both directions. At one time, the tree must have stood alone on the prairie soil and dropped acorns year after year until one tree became a huge forest of oaks.

The merchant road takes a large bend as it travels through the dark woodland. Venerable, wide-trunked oaks line the merchant road and the trunks of the closest ones have been marked by the passage of thousands of travelers and adventurers. Some have carved their initials, some, a picture of loved ones or body parts of odd proportions, and some, the date they passed by.

The high steppe grasslands yields to a green wall of oak trees to the southeast. The oak forest is very old, the greying trunks of the behemoths are cracked and split. The road immediately darkens under the canopy of the green leaves. Pale green bracken ferns grow tall in the eternal twilight shade. Flat, yellow capped mushrooms and rippled shelf fungi sprout from the fallen trees. The pleasant aroma of healthy decomposing leaves fills the air.

Hand pounded concrete pipes, half circle in shape, channel two small streams under the chinked rock and gravel road-bed.

The road marker clearly points out the cardinal directions using four arrows.   A solid brass road marker is here.

Protected by an outcropping of the rocks that tops another high hill, an oasis of vibrant green mosses reveal a small spring that barely dampens the rocky soil. An industrious and thirsty traveler has coaxed the tricklet of water through a small trench that slowly fills a shallow stone basin. The granite basin holds only enough water to fill a few waterbags.

The merchant road dips down into a small valley with steep walls, cutting across the incline like a switch-back to reduce the grade.  This long but narrow canyon is tree-less and full of gravel and broken rocks. As if to emphasize the strangeness of the sheered rocks, a line of split stone expands across the very center of the valley.

The merchant road threads through bottom of the small, narrow valley. Sheer granite walls block the view from the well traveled road to either side and above, only a narrow ray of sky testifies to the time of day. The engineers set a route as far as possible from the broken stones in the center of the valley and, by luck or design, this foresight has saved the road-bed from constant reconstruction. Small cracks run parallel to the road, but none have broken through the thick layers of sand and stone.

One layer of rock in the steep walls has eroded faster then the harder granite or bedrock above and below it. Soft sandstone has been stripped away to form an arch in the valley wall ... a concave indention that goes for hundreds of feet in both directions.  Within the hardened sediment left ages ago upon the land are treasures beyond value: fossilized shells by the thousands, in all sizes, shapes and colors.  A sandstone blue scaled fish fossil, a dusty green spiral leaf fossil, and a multi toothed jaw bone fossil are here.

The momentous forces that have wrought this valley still press upon the land and have done so for eons.  The walls of the valley are sheer and steep, and untouched by the raging waters of river or stream.  As if in testimony to the power of the forces that move the land, a huge dark boulder sits off to the side of the road. It is hewn in half like a sliced melon.  One part sits 20 feet north along the break in the rocks from the other part.

As the merchant road approaches the western end of the valley, the valley wall abruptly falls away to a sheer drop. Crumbling rock and dirt spill constantly into the deep abyss. Sections of the mountain have slid away into the valley and the merchant road has been rebuilt higher along the steeper sides of the mountain. The fault line of broken rocks continues its path of destruction to the west, skirted by the land-slide prone softer dirt.   A freshly uncovered crevice is here.

A treacherous dusty trail leads west along the shaky fault line from a fork in the main road. The original roadbed has fallen into the chasm years ago, leaving the merchants to their own wiles to ply the slippery slopes past the fault zone. Many attempts have failed at conquering the shifting dirt and rocks. Currently a bumpy trail skirts the bigger rocks and loose gravel.

Cutting across a wide debris path, the merchant road is barely discernible from the hemorrhage of slowly decaying mountain.  Small footprints track across the torpid river but disappear within hours. To the north, a landmark of sorts allows travelers a point from which to reconoiter their path. A mount of rocks that resembles the beak of a large bird marks the northern rim of the crater. Southbound traffic must rely on their wits to reach the badlands beyond the chasm.

Old trees lay side by side with the massive boulders of the mountain, intermingling in a terrible landslide. The mountain top has broken off and slid across the eastern road stopping all forms of transportation. It would take years for mortal hands to remove the tons of stone from the original roadway to make it passable once again. Thankfully, nature has changed the landscape for the better, and has opened a gap through the mountain to the north.

Thick grey and white clouds hang heavily near the edge of the road, swirling ever so slightly in the breeze.

[The Silver Strand.]

A ribbon of pure silver stretches out through the billowing clouds toward the peak of the mountain. Each step is like walking on soft carpeting but without any solid underfooting to hold one up. Any movement on the silver strand makes the surface flow like the waves on the ocean, rippling into the distance.

[The Silver Strand.]

The strand twists and stretches and in some parts is not entirely there. Large holes open and close on its surface but without fail passage over these rifts is made without any problems. Above and surrounding the strand, the billowing clouds make up the walls of a silky tunnel, flickering with light and the sounds of rolling thunder every so often. The tunnel leads east to a solid mountain roadway and west into a blur.

[The Silver Strand.]

The strand and tunnel end abruptly before you, dispersing in the strong wind that blows down from the mountain. The next steps will have you hundreds of feet above the mountain base, standing on nothing but air, all solid footing gone. Across this long gap, on its otherside, the silver strand and the cloud tunnel begin again, making their way toward the mountain tower.

[Sky.]

There is nothing here but the open expanse of sky. A silvery walkway ends quite close to the east, its semi-solid footing welcome to most who cannot fly. Far northeast another part of the strand waits for a traveler to set foot on its surface to continue the journey up the mountain. A strong wind blows down from the mountain peak, attempting to bring the massive drop to the ground quickly and painfully to anyone stupid enough to wander out into the sky.

[Sky.]

Nothing but sky and mountains stretch out on all sides. The drop from this height would surely be deadly to anyone. A sliver of silver glints in the distance, rolling slightly within a wall of clouds. To the northeast, as if floating in the sky, a large tower hovers under it's own power. A small white curl of smoke reaches out from the tower towards the small silver path.  Some alabaster upwards leading stairs are here.

[The Silver Strand.]

The narrow silver strand bends and stretches as it begins again. Billowing clouds part long enough for one to glimpse the entire southern half of Tarath Bends in all of its majesty. Though the strand carries its travelers higher above the mountain, the walk itself acts as if one were walking a level roadway.

The restriction in the clouds lessens slightly and begins to open even more to the west. The clouds have turned from the usual white to a light rose color accented with silver sparkles. The strand has also changed a bit, to a darker silvery-black hue.

The northern side of the cloud tunnel is slowly dispersing in the high mountain breezes. Glints of purple and silver shine through and reflect from almost every angle of the strand. The strand begins to solidify, flatten out and begin a slight incline to its end.

The purple and silver glow brightens as the tunnel walls begin to fully dissipate in the mountain breeze. To the north the partially hidden spire of a massive tower pokes through the glistening cloud cover. A purple glow reflects through the cover and across the face of the building, beautifully accented by the silver trim and polished silver spire.

The strand has totally solidified, its silver-black surface smooth and shiny. A low humming sound permeates the air along with short thunderous bursts and flickers of lightning. The tower is almost completely in view, its shining purple walls glowing brightly. At the tip of the spire, glowing bright purple, stands a beautifully crafted scarab, its outstretched wings glistening silver.

[The Silver Strand.]

The strand widens toward the base of the tower, its silver-black surface reflecting the purple light from the walls. The tower is now completely in view, its walls not just glowing purple, but made of some sort of deep purple crystal magickally infused with a glowing light. There is but a single entrance gate and one narrow window slit high above the ground noticeable with a first glance. The silver spire hums slightly giving off a beautiful tune.

[The Crystal Tower.]

A massive purple crystal tower soars overhead, its silver spire polished to a bright shine. The walls pulse slightly as if beating like a massive heart. The mountain peak rises high on either side of the building, cradling the tower in its grasp. A massive gate protects the tower interior from any who do not belong.   An open silver-trimmed purple crystal gate is here.

[Ilmand's Tower, Ground Floor.]

A mass of white polished marble makes up the floor and ceiling of this cylindrical ground floor. Dark purple walls enclose the tower, inclining slightly as they rise up to meet the ceiling. The entire ground floor is open, the rear wall completely visible and swirling with different purple hues. A glimmer of silver can be seen rising through the ceiling in the northwest.

Long tables filled with various magickal devices, scrolls and containers of strange items line the far corner walls forming an "L".

Powerful magickal energy flashes through the air every so often, the reddish-blue bolts dancing off the walls, ceiling and floor.

[Ancient gateway.]

An old gate stands here, seemingly supported by nothing at all. Through it, you can see the remains of a small village, long destroyed. To the northwest, the rutted remains of what once have been a road wind through the tree filled swamp.  A broken bronze gate is here.

[Town Square Center.]

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.   A flowing white marble fountain, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a marble statue of a Human, a carved marble statue of a Dragon, and a rosewood sign are here.
