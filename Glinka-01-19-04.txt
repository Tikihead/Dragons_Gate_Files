A large path made of black stones dominates this area. Although obviously well-traveled, they remain solidly set and leveled indicating a high level of maintenance. A short distance away is a less impressive area surrounded by giant sickly green hedges. The hedges appear to move and make noises.....could something alive be in there?

Here the path widens to an oblong circle. You can only deduce that it must be so that supply carts heading opposite directions have a place to get around one another, since the rest of the path is too narrow and closely lined with thorny shrubs to allow convenient passage elsewhere.  Ruts are worn in the cobblestones, which indicate many years of use. The ruts run with what appears to be water, but that smell... that smell...  A sign is here.

[Execution Square, Dungeon Tower.]

Large black and gleaming block stones lie fashioned together in a towering shape. A gruesome and intimidating black wrought iron portcullis dominates the front of the tower. Both sides of the gate host blackened marble gargoyles that protectively guarded the entranceway. Below, meandering trails of silver mist spiral and cover the ground. City guardsmen beat prisoners into submission and drag them through the giant black portcullis where violent criminals and a dank cell await them.  A glowing wrought iron street lamp, a closed silver-trimmed black steel gate, and a closed black wrought iron portcullis are here.

[Condemned Walk.]

A small rivulet of blood flows down the path that leads from the north and meets up with Condemned Walk. At the end of the path lies Execution Square and its viewing stands. It is at this point that the sentenced criminals discover their fate. Many hope to battle for their lives in the arena, but for most, the sentence is execution by one of the Spurian Justices.  A street lantern is here.

[Town Square East.]

Travel to the eastern portion of Town Square finds battle clad warriors shoulder to shoulder with chained criminals and those who live outside the Spurian Walls. The cobblestones that line the street are stained with blood.  It is unknown as to whether the blood is from guards carrying out quick executions, or gladiators who refused to wait their turn for arena space.  A street lantern is here.

[Town Square Center.]

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.   A flowing white marble fountain, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a cracked marble statue of a Human, a carved marble statue of a Dragon, a rosewood sign, some flaming ruby ashes, a deep fluffy snow drift, some vomit, a broken tiny shrunken skull pendant, a jet black hooded shadow cloak, a jet black hooded shadow cloak, and a jet black hooded shadow cloak are here.

People carrying bundles stream in from the west and rapidly lose themselves in the large crowds moving about in the vast town square.

A neatly kept park fronts this portion of Merchant Walk. Topiary and low shrubberies partition off small sections of the park.

Merchants, some in frilly finery, others dressed in homespun wools, travel back and forth along this street on their way to and from work. They seem to blend together here, if only briefly.

Several city guardsmen have just finished wrestling to the ground some young tough thieves, who thought to rob one of the returning merchants. To one side a relieved-looking Fir Elf gentleman holds on tightly to his gold-tipped walking stick, as the human boy yells his innocence to any who might listen. His pleas fall on deaf ears as the guards drag him away.  A street lantern is here.

Merchant Walk comes to an abrupt end at a massive moonsilver gate. The towering walls of Spur on either side of the gates force all to pass by the guards who are constantly on the watch for thieves and bandits. Just beyond the gates one can glimpse the bustling Merchant District of Spur.  A gilded oak sign and a street lantern are here.

[Trade Way.]

A large gate separates the Merchant District and Town Square-the hub of Spur's activity. The partially opened gate is currently able to accommodate the simultaneous passage of several locals and visitors, but can be expanded to accept carriages, or sealed to ward against invasion.  Guards stand sentry from atop the wall as well as the ground.  A street lantern is here.

Many townsfolk pass along this busy thoroughfare. Rich and poor alike mix freely on this street, much to the dismay of a passing nobleman. A young human struggles with an armful of packages and two young children in tow. Those in need of goods or supplies head west towards the market, those looking for the news of the day head east towards Town Square.  A street lantern is here.

[Trade Way & Bazaar Path.]

A path to the north winds its way among various stalls and tents. Some specialty outlets can be found, provided one does not get lost in this maze known as the Bazaar. More permanent structures to the south suggest finer goods as well as increased security.  A street lantern is here.

[Bazaar Path.]

Many people crowd the narrow Bazaar Path, either heading towards the infamous Bazaar, or forcing their way back towards Trade Way. For a small price, a farmer can rent a booth and directly market his goods. Both some of the best and some of the worst deals can be made within this collection of stalls. The tall wall of Spur looms high to the east, and many of the guards take an early peek into the carts and the goods coming to market.  A street lantern is here.

Further passage along Bazaar Path is blocked occasionally by brawling peasants. Fights break out over who got here first, who gets to sell first, whose goods are better and who should just pack up and leave. When guards are forced to leave their posts to settle the arguments, all involved lose.  A street lantern is here.

The muffled noises you hear drifting in from the west come out of the Bazaar itself, a veritable hive of activity day and night. An occasion exotic smell is carried by the breeze to tantalize the nose. A large etched window displays tastefully dressed mannequins of many races.  An open sturdy mahogany door and a street lantern are here.

The going slows down briefly as someone stops dead in their tracks. Every so often one feels the need to take in the sounds and smells that are uniquely the Bazaar. Any slow down in the movement of the crowd creates a loud string of curses. The sellers are eager to get to market to get rid of their goods, and the buyers anticipate their purchases.  A street lantern is here.

A break in the traffic shows a small worn path that heads to the west. Many travel that way, sure of their ability to navigate the stalls and tents that create this market place. The larger carts and those not too sure of themselves continue to head north. A small shack sits on the eastern side of the road, its door hanging precariously on its hinges.

[Food Way.]

The heavy odor tickling your nose proclaims this the food section of the Bazaar. Foods native to every species can be found throughout the area. Many of the items are unique delicacies, not found anywhere else. A quick glance at a few of them and you are pretty certain you know why. A semi-permanent structure stands to the north of the path. A sign over the door announces the location as Gwollin's Brews.  An open faded walnut door and a street lantern are here.

At this intersection many stands display their exotic foodstuffs. Hanging from large hooks are various unidentifiable hunks of meat, and vegetables of all shapes and colors. The only thing more prevalent than the merchants and buyers are the bugs, who clamor to find the most pungent item to land on. To the northeast a small tent can barely be seen hiding behind the stalls.  A white silk tent and a street lantern are here.

The well-defined Bazaar path heads off to the west. This corner is a mix of the old and the new. On one corner an old stall is barely standing. The roof has caved in, and it quickly becomes apparent that this location has become a local dump. Pieces of wood that look suspiciously like some of the leftovers from other construction sites are piled on top of rotting offal. On the opposite corner a new tent is being erected, its high roof and vivid coloring pleasing to the eye.  An open stall and a street lantern are here.

A new stall has been hastily constructed on this site, in the shadow of the large Spurian Wall. Most chose to build well within the Bazaar as opposed to this outer path. Low-grade wood and bent nails make up this sorry excuse for a business establishment. A small sign on the front has a crude picture of a key on it, and the name, "Skugz."  A crooked wooden sign, a weathered dark wooden stall, and a broken street lantern are here.

Two large Oog-ra guards refuse to allow anyone to continue south. With loud gestures and over exaggerated pointing, they send wagons to the east or back north.

Bazaar Path follows the line of the Spurian Wall. High above you can hear orders being barked and guards marching in rhythm. The closeness of the wall to the path has essentially blocked any breeze that might waft through the area. The stagnant air holds in the smells of food, incense and lots of bodies.

An old Thugian pulls and pushes a very stubborn donkey. Neither end seems to be cooperating with his demands. Two small children dance around the Thugian and the donkey, chanting and singing a nasty song. Quickly, he takes out a switch, which is enough encouragement for both the donkey to move and the children to run.  A street lantern is here.

When guards are forced to leave their posts to settle the arguments, all involved lose.  A street lantern is here.

[Bazaar Path.]

Many people crowd the narrow Bazaar Path, either heading towards the infamous Bazaar, or forcing their way back towards Trade Way. For a small price, a farmer can rent a booth and directly market his goods. Both some of the best and some of the worst deals can be made within this collection of stalls. The tall wall of Spur looms high to the east, and many of the guards take an early peek into the carts and the goods coming to market.  A street lantern is here.

[Trade Way & Bazaar Path.]

A path to the north winds its way among various stalls and tents. Some specialty outlets can be found, provided one does not get lost in this maze known as the Bazaar. More permanent structures to the south suggest finer goods as well as increased security.  A street lantern is here.

[Trade & Market.]

The buildings of Market Circle stand to the south. It becomes obvious that the area through the arch is a much cleaner marketplace than the bazaar. An inviting eatery stands beside the road, its door open to those weary after a long trip to Spur, as well as those preparing to venture to the great expanses beyond the west gate. A human couple exit the building, arm in arm. A small sign stands beside the intersection.  A sign, an open glossy lacquered oak door, and a street lantern are here.

A path to the north winds its way among various stalls and tents. Some specialty outlets can be found, provided one does not get lost in this maze known as the Bazaar. More permanent structures to the south suggest finer goods as well as increased security.  A street lantern is here.

Many townsfolk pass along this busy thoroughfare. Rich and poor alike mix freely on this street, much to the dismay of a passing nobleman. A young human struggles with an armful of packages and two young children in tow. Those in need of goods or supplies head west towards the market, those looking for the news of the day head east towards Town Square.  A street lantern is here.

A large gate separates the Merchant District and Town Square-the hub of Spur's activity. The partially opened gate is currently able to accommodate the simultaneous passage of several locals and visitors, but can be expanded to accept carriages, or sealed to ward against invasion.  Guards stand sentry from atop the wall as well as the ground.  A street lantern is here.

Merchant Walk comes to an abrupt end at a massive moonsilver gate. The towering walls of Spur on either side of the gates force all to pass by the guards who are constantly on the watch for thieves and bandits. Just beyond the gates one can glimpse the bustling Merchant District of Spur.  A gilded oak sign and a street lantern are here.

Several city guardsmen have just finished wrestling to the ground some young tough thieves, who thought to rob one of the returning merchants. To one side a relieved-looking Fir Elf gentleman holds on tightly to his gold-tipped walking stick, as the human boy yells his innocence to any who might listen. His pleas fall on deaf ears as the guards drag him away.  A street lantern is here.

Merchants, some in frilly finery, others dressed in homespun wools, travel back and forth along this street on their way to and from work. They seem to blend together here, if only briefly.

[Town Square Center.]

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.   A flowing white marble fountain, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a cracked marble statue of a Human, a carved marble statue of a Dragon, a rosewood sign, some flaming ruby ashes, a deep fluffy snow drift, some vomit, a broken tiny shrunken skull pendant, and a broken delicately crafted gold music box are here.

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.   A flowing white marble fountain, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a cracked marble statue of a Human, a carved marble statue of a Dragon, a rosewood sign, some flaming ruby ashes, a deep fluffy snow drift, some vomit, a broken tiny shrunken skull pendant, and a broken delicately crafted gold music box are here.

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.   A flowing white marble fountain, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a cracked marble statue of a Human, a carved marble statue of a Dragon, a rosewood sign, some flaming ruby ashes, a deep fluffy snow drift, some vomit, a broken tiny shrunken skull pendant, and a broken delicately crafted gold music box are here.

Several of the Ladies of the city stroll along the avenue chatting about the current events and latest gossip of the Spur. Behind them, harried servants carry their reticules and all those belongings that they cannot be without.  A street lantern is here.

Vast estates tower over the huge Spurian wall towards the south. The well-to-do who live in these homes idle away their days, enjoying the luxury of time. Standing next to a very empty lantern pole, a small Flerian child insists in a plaintive wail, that he had nothing to do with the missing lantern. The well-dressed guard that interrogates him keeps pointing at a small sack on the ground and its obvious contents.  An open small burlap sack and a street lantern are here.

The boughs of a large apple tree hang over the well tended avenue. Below the beautiful tree stands a small fountain. Atop the fountain is an intricately carved Secian who appears to be dancing with the water as it splashes around her. Set in the marble base is a small plaque that reads, "For those who have gone before us." Many stand for a moment as they pass this way, giving thanks for the gift of life that is given by both the apple tree and the Secians of long ago. Large piles of dirt and broken stone lay on either side of the street as workmen ready the east and west alleys for expansion.  A street lantern, a Secian etched moonsilver door, a pair of open silver forged swinging doors, and a sign above the doors are here.

Standing next to the large iron gate that separates the center of town from those of the elite class are several of the Spurian Guard. They are here to assist all who pass with the simple kindness of opening a gate, or the more important task of escorting those in need to the bank or market. A young looking cadet rubs wax into the stones of the city wall, his task is daunting, but one that will teach him discipline.  An open iron gate and a street lantern are here.

A row of torches lines each wall, each mounted in an ornately crafted iron holder. The walls are constructed of expertly chiseled slabs of reddish granite, all having been carved with scenes of Hithual battles of yore. Each slab is trimmed by gold-flecked black granite. You hear a group of rowdy Hithuals shout in unison "ALE!". A highly polished dark walnut bar, lined with tankards is before you, a row of barstools in front of it. A number of large rocks have also been placed around as seats for those who prefer the feel of a mine. A long-bearded Hithual grins at you from behind the bar awaiting your order.

The outward appearance of the people here seems a bit classier. Rich clothing and large coin purses are prevalent amongst the travelers. In fact, many of the folk heading into Town Square from the south are accompanied by large bodyguards to assure their safety. The well maintained road is lined with small brass lanterns, each swinging off an individual pole. No expense has been spared to keep those who travel this road safe from the hoodlums that relish the darkness.  A street lantern and some charred foliage are here.

The elegant Hotel Royale towers above the street, its emerald door sparkling in the light. The patrons that stroll in and out are catered to, doors opened and closed for them, and baggage and packages carried by harried servants. The large Bank of Spur sits on the east side of the square. Its location close to the Royale is not a coincidence. A gold-trimmed door is proof of the success of this branch of the Spurian bank and those who run it.  An elegant gold-trimmed walnut door, open emerald steel door, and a street lantern are here.

A large wagon sits on the side of the street, its load having shifted and then toppled over. A Usil driver yells at his two Oog-ra helpers, explaining to them that the armoire should be sitting upright and not on its side. They scratch themselves in confusion, and you can hear them muttering something about leaving it on its side, so it does not fall again. There will be a resident who is unhappy with their purchase this evening.  A street lantern is here.

Law Road from the south and Shoteron Way from the east join before turning toward Town Square to the northwest. If one stays at this location long enough, they see the irony of these two roads joining. Most who are escorted south along Law Road are the criminals and ne'er-do-wells of the Spur, while those travel along Shoteron Way are the upper class residents whom live further east. Two office building, the City Planners Office and the Archmage's office stand on opposite sides of the road, each one neatly kept and freshly painted.

The garden is surrounded by a non-symmetrical stone wall done in earthen shades, yellow roses and wild vines clinging to its stony face. A small mosaic just barely peeking out from the mass of flowers and leaves can be viewed as the sun rises. In the midst of it all, a large willow tree spreads its massive branches over the area, colorful paper lanterns hanging within. A lush blanket of natural carpet, deep green clover spouting from the ground to form a soft pathway. The edge of the pond reaches to the edge of the path, the beginning of a breathtaking garden starting here. In the distance the calls of ducks and other wildlife can be heard. From one of the tallest tree branches, the echoing hum of busy bees sound from a golden beehive, the scent of honey filling the air with a delightful aroma.  An earthen stone wall mosaic and an open vine entwined silver gate are here.

Cheerful laughter can be heard echoing through this open air garden as wisps of bright colors flash past. Secians run and play a game of mid-flight tag, merrily flying past one another as their rainbow wings become a blur. Gray flecked white marble benches line a small, deep blue pool filled with cool, tranquil waters with the exception of a stray duck making a crash-landing. Various sorts of flowers from every imaginable part of Aradath sprout in full bloom in all areas, nearly overtaking the pathway. A red rosebush stands out in particular, well kept, the flowers bloom brilliantly opening to the sun. The scent of delicate floral mixed with fresh grass and tall, green leafed trees makes for an intoxicatingly fresh aroma.  A red rosebush is here.

Pillows of bright colors, large and small, line the corner of the room, providing an inviting place for conversations and relaxation. A winding staircase with a thick wrought iron railing wraps its way upwards, only to grow hazy with wisps of mist as it reaches the ceiling. A few carved marble benches line the fountain for those that wish to sit next to it, the feet of the seating resembling that of a clawed Dragon.

Worn stones form the walls and floor of this room; veined in ruby, the stones feel warm on the soles of your feet, glowing with their radiating heat. The air shimmers with the warmth emanating from the center of the area. A huge gold lined pit sits directly in the middle, magical red and amber flames dance within it. Roughly carved wooden logs surround the blaze, allowing one to bask in the warmth of the flames. Shadows dance along the walls, forming the perfect backdrop of mystery. Charred-ended sticks are scattered about, some with the blackened remains of marshmallows and other roasted foods.  Some glowing mystical red swirled amber flames and a golden fire pit are here.

Only two walls remain of this once large room. A few stray blades of grass protrude through the stone floor, sprouting between the cracks. You can still make out what was once a glorious mosaic, depicting a fluffy white cloud puffing a breath of swirled white and sapphire wind. A warm breeze flows through the area, and whispers through the four supportive blue sapphire pillars holding aloft a highly polished dome roof. A few cracks in the silver dome allow rays of warm sunlight to enter, creating chaotic patterns on the floor as the sun moves throughout the day. Suddenly a myriad of bubbles surround you, dancing through the air entering from cracks within the wall. The bubbles pop as they touch any furniture or person and vanish from sight. Soft feather stuffed white and blue silk pillows lay in groups around the room, surprisingly untouched from the elements and popping bubbles.  A pile of blue and white feathered pillows is here.

A smooth gray marble floor flecked with white spreads out beneath you. A constant, calming sound of trickling water can be heard from a small matching marble fountain in the center. The fresh water trickles down from the three-tiered fountain spreading over little black and white pebbles in the basin. Pillows of bright colors, large and small, line the corner of the room, providing an inviting place for conversations and relaxation. A winding staircase with a thick wrought iron railing wraps its way upwards, only to grow hazy with wisps of mist as it reaches the ceiling. A few carved marble benches line the fountain for those that wish to sit next to it, the feet of the seating resembling that of a clawed Dragon. Affixed to one of the walls is a small plaque made of a blackened silvery-gray metal.  A blackened silver-trimmed plaque, a tall flowing marble fountain, and a mist covered cobblestone pathway are here.

A highly detailed mural in various shades of turquoise and amethyst depicts the rolling ocean. White sea foam spreads across the edges of the waves into the clear sky of the elaborate wall paintings. The floor is made of a thick glass, underneath a pool of water swirls creating the illusion of being out to sea. A few fan-tailed fish swim through the underground pool and fade away from sight to some unknown area. A gentle breeze blows through the room at sporadic times, refreshing and soothing. Stray patches of white sand litter the floor, leading to their dune piles residing in the corners, creating a comfortable place to sit or build a castle.  An open amethyst swirled marble chest is here.

Overhead, the canopy of deep green leaves allows for only a little bit of sun to shine through, dappling the area in patches light. The dark brown trees seem ancient and impossibly huge. Vines climb across their branches, connecting each to the next. Lush vegetation grows around their bases; broad leafed ferns, and tropical flowers. A few rare copper tinted flowers sprout near the tallest of the dark trees. Bright jewel colored hummingbirds dart around cheerfully, not seeming to mind any noise or visitors. The roots of the largest tree in the center of the grove form a small depression, filled with the blue green waters accumulated during rainfall. Small stone benches rest in the nooks of the roots around the pool. Copper basins next to them are filled with refreshments.  A majestic willow tree and an ancient tarnished copper basin are here.

Cheerful laughter can be heard echoing through this open air garden as wisps of bright colors flash past. Secians run and play a game of mid-flight tag, merrily flying past one another as their rainbow wings become a blur. Gray flecked white marble benches line a small, deep blue pool filled with cool, tranquil waters with the exception of a stray duck making a crash-landing. Various sorts of flowers from every imaginable part of Aradath sprout in full bloom in all areas, nearly overtaking the pathway. A red rosebush stands out in particular, well kept, the flowers bloom brilliantly opening to the sun. The scent of delicate floral mixed with fresh grass and tall, green leafed trees makes for an intoxicatingly fresh aroma.  A red rosebush and a mist covered cobblestone pathway are here.

The garden is surrounded by a non-symmetrical stone wall done in earthen shades, yellow roses and wild vines clinging to its stony face. A small mosaic just barely peeking out from the mass of flowers and leaves can be viewed as the sun rises. In the midst of it all, a large willow tree spreads its massive branches over the area, colorful paper lanterns hanging within. A lush blanket of natural carpet, deep green clover spouting from the ground to form a soft pathway. The edge of the pond reaches to the edge of the path, the beginning of a breathtaking garden starting here. In the distance the calls of ducks and other wildlife can be heard. From one of the tallest tree branches, the echoing hum of busy bees sound from a golden beehive, the scent of honey filling the air with a delightful aroma.  An earthen stone wall mosaic and a closed vine entwined silver gate are here.

The fresh water trickles down from the three-tiered fountain spreading over little black and white pebbles in the basin. Pillows of bright colors, large and small, line the corner of the room, providing an inviting place for conversations and relaxation. A winding staircase with a thick wrought iron railing wraps its way upwards, only to grow hazy with wisps of mist as it reaches the ceiling. A few carved marble benches line the fountain for those that wish to sit next to it, the feet of the seating resembling that of a clawed Dragon.

Upon entering this pitch black painted circular room it is difficult to find your bearings at first. Much darker in hue than the rest of the areas, the decor has been styled to represent a midnight sky.  An ebony archway barely visible rests on the far wall, magick surrounding it, preventing visibility into the area on the other side. Astonishing platinum stars inlaid into the ceiling flicker in the low pillar candle light.  Magickal platinum flamed candles made of deep black beeswax rest upon small round ebony tables.  Light fluffy pillows shaped to resemble clouds are stacked in three corners, dark blue and indigo in shade.  A few warm fleece blankets are stacked upon a black marble shelf carved into the wall, allowing visitors to keep warm even on the coldest of nights.

Bright light fills this room at all times of day, reminding of pure, natural sunlight.  The rays of illumination have a brassy tint to them, creating a warm hued glow upon the simple furniture of this open-air room. Only one wall stands here, a divider to some unseen area; covered in brilliant emerald vines, splitting and taking over through cracks and niches. A single dark green vine appears sturdy enough to climb. A handmade bronze sun rests upon the wall, attached at the rough hammered points, only barely visible through the vines. Furniture built of bronze and brass center around a small pond within the center of the room. Hardly deep, a few metallic-hued fish can be seen through the emerald greenish mossy waters. When night turns to day, the bronze sun glows momentarily as a pale blue mist comes from within it, creating a magickal faux sky overhead resembling that of noon time; slowly it fades away as the day truly changes and the stars outside fade from few.  A deep crack in the wall and a smooth ebony archway are here.

Pillows of bright colors, large and small, line the corner of the room, providing an inviting place for conversations and relaxation. A winding staircase with a thick wrought iron railing wraps its way upwards, only to grow hazy with wisps of mist as it reaches the ceiling. A few carved marble benches line the fountain for those that wish to sit next to it, the feet of the seating resembling that of a clawed Dragon.

Mysterious mists form the barrier around this strange garden. Nothing can be seen of the route you took to get here. Giant sized flowers bloom all around you, each one a different color and shade. A lush carpet of jewel green grass cushions your feet. The call of exotic birds echo through the air. Breaking through the path of flowers you come upon a small clump of peach trees. Luscious fruits hang from their drooping branches. Some have already been plucked and placed in a large straw basket. At the center of the stand of trees is spread a large quilted blanket. Upon closer examination of the quilt you notice each square shows a different stage of being in the life of a dragon. Quiet descends around you, filling the area with a sense of peace.  A long vine, an open deep ribboned picnic basket, and a large multicolored quilted blanket are here.

A smooth gray marble floor flecked with white spreads out beneath you. A constant, calming sound of trickling water can be heard from a small matching marble fountain in the center. The fresh water trickles down from the three-tiered fountain spreading over little black and white pebbles in the basin. Pillows of bright colors, large and small, line the corner of the room, providing an inviting place for conversations and relaxation. A winding staircase with a thick wrought iron railing wraps its way upwards, only to grow hazy with wisps of mist as it reaches the ceiling. A few carved marble benches line the fountain for those that wish to sit next to it, the feet of the seating resembling that of a clawed Dragon. Affixed to one of the walls is a small plaque made of a blackened silvery-gray metal.  A blackened silver-trimmed plaque, a tall flowing marble fountain, and a mist covered cobblestone pathway are here.

This room is illuminated.
In the room are Amabel the Noble Secian and Lurker the Drake.
Obvious exits: north* east* south* west*.
