[Cliffside Path.]

The hill rises steeply to the east, making travel difficult.  The intertwined branches overhead form an ominous cover, blocking out the sky from view.  A path along the cliff is here.

In the area are Marinda the Secian, Lilyth the Noble Secian, and Tymas the Leuian.

[Cliff.]

You realize this hidden spot is not visible from the edge of great forest across the ravine. Lush grass covers the ground surrounding a shimmering pure moonsilver pool; its surface reflecting the beauty of the skies above.  A steep slope and a path along the cliff are here.

[Forest End]

The trees end suddenly as you have come to an immensely wide canyon.  A bridge at one time led across to the other side.  Now, however, the bridge is broken and looks to be beyond repair. Across the ravine you see nothing but rock and barren landscape.  A crumbling bridge is here.

The path here is wide and seems to be underlaid with stone. Looking closer, the stone seems to be laid out in a regular pattern.  Perhaps this is the remains of a road. You wonder where it leads as a wolf howls mournfully in the distance.

The path slopes down to the south here as it leads away from the hill.  The evergreens subside as the ground becomes moist due to the proximity of the stream. The undergrowth is quite thick here, and the music of the stream begins to pervade your senses.  A charming embankment is here.

The skeletal remains of some fish litter the stream bank and nosing about you notice some large pawprints.  A wooden bridge and some skeletal fish remains are here.

A small stream runs noisily under the two bridges spanning the ravine. A number of the brunt oaks still stand about, memorials to the forest this once was. A number of small saplings dot the ground between the black trunks.  A stone bridge, a wooden bridge, and a clump of wildgrass are here.

A fine haze of dust hovers over the remains of the Silver Owl Inn. Through the fallen timbers and memories of lives lost, one can see brilliant green sprouts reaching for sunlight. A tiny songbird perches on an old stick of furniture poking through the rubble, singing sweetly to herald new life and hope.  A charred ancient steelwood tree and a broken wooden plank with writing are here.

The well-worn path leads past a small clean shack and into a well formed tunnel through the thorn bushes to the east and the Caersech to the west. The small shack is set back from the road, its walls built of a whitewashed birch. A sturdy corral, filled with well-fed horses, stands to the left of the shack. A matched pair of dapple grays stand in front of the shack waiting to take their human baggage to their destination. To the left of the door, behind a small paned window, a beautiful Fir Elf female takes coin and in return, with a charming smile, directs those who have paid their fare into the waiting room.  A small shack, a freshly painted sign, and a notice of non-refund are here.
