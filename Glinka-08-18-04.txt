[Trade Way.]

This well-worn road separates the Bazaar to the north and Market Circle to the south. Only a Thugian could appreciate the layered odors of simmering foodstuffs and shoppers from the Bazaar. Crowds of people push past, some brushing against you. It might be a good idea to keep an eye on your coinpurse.  A street lantern is here.

[Trade & Market.]

The buildings of Market Circle stand to the south. It becomes obvious that the area through the arch is a much cleaner marketplace than the bazaar. An inviting eatery stands beside the road, its door open to those weary after a long trip to Spur, as well as those preparing to venture to the great expanses beyond the west gate. A human couple exit the building, arm in arm. A small sign stands beside the intersection.  A sign, an open glossy lacquered oak door, and a street lantern are here.

[Trade Way.]

The throngs of travelers thicken as one heads east along Trade Way. An Anthian plays softly on a strange looking stringed instrument, her melodic voice filling the air. Judging by her clothing, and the number of silvers at her feet, she makes a fine living practicing her craft.  A street lantern is here.

[Trade Way.]

Deep grey mists surround a strange pile of rubble that lies south of the road. Occasionally a priest clad in a simple grey robe will wander past the rubble and whisper a short prayer under his breath. The fence running around the rubble is well kept, but the gate which once allowed entrance to this Temple has been chained closed.  A grey iron chained gate, a pile of rubble, and a street lantern are here.

From the city gate to the west, Trade Way continues eastward towards the busy Merchant district, past Joyeusse's Shop. The air is thick with the scent of fresh flowers. Wagons filled with goods bound for sale trundle past, their drivers hopeful of the anticipated profits. Eager young warriors venture towards the west gate and the dangers beyond.  An open carved rosewood door and a street lantern are here.

[Gateway.]

The relative safety inside Spur is a comfort to those returning from the fields and mountains. To those leaving, a massive wall of defense around the city lies ahead. Archer towers beside the gate overlook the wall, offering a painful welcome to would-be invaders. Several guards on foot patrol pass and disappear behind a thick, bluesteel banded steelwood door. Wall road stretches to the south, a wide passage between the city wall and several large buildings.  An open iron gate, an open thick stone door, and a street lantern are here.

[Spur Gateway.]

Travelers from Rathan to the northwest, and the Trade Route to the south, converge at Spur's west gate. Guards posted on the ground give those seeking to enter the city a cursory once-over. Their lack of interest shows that anyone approaching has already been observed from above for some time. A grate in the ground loosens mud from wagon wheels and hooves before they pass through the gate, helping to keep the streets of Spur fairly clean.  An open giant black iron gate, a giant green oak tree, a small blue pool, a thick oak grate over the pool, and a polished stone marker are here.

The path is flanked by countless tall oaks, swaying peacefully in the wind. They do their best to hide the sky from view, making it hard to tell night from day at times. Littering the area are pieces of broken wagon, bits of human remains and dried splotches of blood. The remnants of a violent fight lie all around you, whomever used to belong to the wagon is no more than vulture food.  A bloody severed foot is here.

In the dusty distance, Spur's great wall demarks the southern end of this well-traveled merchant's road. Soaring majestically to the north stands the spiky pinnacles and snow topped peaks of an epic mountain range so immense that it separates lands, races, and cultures. Connecting the two is a merchant road built long ago.

This well traveled road transverses the flat terrain shouldered by weeds and vines and, due to the proximity of the city, small paths continuously cut through the road from either side.

Lush grass grows up to the borders of a thick, dense forest that cloaks the hills to the west. The grasslands thin near the grove as the huge trees completely shade the ground, and are replaced by taller bushes and juniper trees. The contrast between the waving stalks on the flat vista and the dark leaves of almost vertical trees is striking.

From the west spans a dark green forest of Sycamore and Beech trees that soak in the moister parts of the lower river valley. The tall, shaded forest breaks like a green tinged wave upon the tranquil calm of the grasslands. The huge trees within are ancient, reaching hundreds of feet into the air. As if steaming from a great cauldron, a heavy ground fog seeps from deep within the forest carrying with it the fresh smell of decomposing green matter.

A rickety criss-crossed rough beam fence pens the grazing of black and white cows whose ponderous forms are barely visible through the tall grass on either side of the road. To the north, the soft, undulating grassland floor of the wide valley succumbs to the rolling foothills, which in turn delineates the imposing outline of a vista-spanning mountain range. Many a traveler has witnessed this idyllic vantage point and has been drawn on to follow the road that travels into the heart of the mountains.

The road diverts around a small pool of murky water that lies to the north. A confusion of hoof prints muddies the shoreline where the placid bovines have come to water themselves. The pool is damned by a small hillock which allows no drainage so the pool remains stagnant. The mountains to the north reflect in perfectly upside-down symmetry on the still pond's surface, only wavering slightly in concentric circles to the deft touch of small insects.

Splayed avion tracks dot the dried mud in random order permanently recording the hunters conquest of lesser things from the mud and moss.

Aged and splintered into the vague circular shape, a decaying wagon wheel is left to rot in the grass by the roadside. Their roots protectively sheltered from the weather, idiosyntric sprouts of taller grasses thrive haphazardly inside the wheel. Several tiny holes top small pyramids of sandy debris, where a few red fire ants scout their wagon-wheel domain for fodder.

As the road bends around a curve, ruts left by merchant's wagons cut so deeply into the mud that all wheeled vehicles are forced to follow the set path. Four loaded wagons of a merchants caravan stand idle as one larger than standard wagon skitters along the path. The buckboard's frame groans and strains to keep it inline while the driver attempts to negotiate the turn. Four dark maned, matched mules balk at the noise behind them, and stomp nervously over the deep ruts. The liveried caravan guards attempt to haul the mules forward, further adding to the mules stubborn refusal to move.

The road charges across a flat valley through waving stalks of grain with coppery tinted seeds. Around the northern edge grows a row of huge cypress trees with trunks that measure eight feet across. Debris from the trees' self-trimming mats the taller grasses into an impenetrable wall. The cypresses produce the necessary windbreak for the field to bear the heavy headed grain.

A neatly kept plank house with a stone well and fenced paddock overlooks grain fields to the southeast.

Neat stacks of foraged sticks and axe-hewn firewood sit adjacent to the blackened rocks of two impromptu fire rings. Freshly dug midden pits waft clues to the camp's frequent use into the clean mountain air.

Just to the north, the roadway curves gently around a bend in a large river that flows towards the southeast. An enormous smooth round rock splits off a small eddy from the main current resulting a deep, clear pool by the eastern side of the road. The cool calm water catches the reflection of the white snowcapped mountain range further up the valley while the river rushes past towards Spur. Five fishermen recline on folding chairs or against rocks, tethered by the silvery lines of their poles to the fishing hole. Each fisherman is spread evenly around the pool as if held apart by some invisible barrier as they eye the large shadowy fish shapes finning effortlessly against the mild current in the eddy.

The huge stone bridge span was built tall to allow the various merchant ships to pass underneath. This amazing height affords a splendid view of the countryside: from the blur of smoky residential air to the southeast, across the verdant grasslands that cover the foothills, to the majestic peaks of the mountain range to the north.

The river surges strongly below the stone span. Even from this height, the noise of the flowing water is near deafening. Two small fishing boats nearly collide as they try to tack between the same set of supports. Only skillful sailing prevents them from hitting each other, or the supports.

Mismatched mortar colors and varying types and cuts of the stone show the extent of the reconstruction made by quick working masons. A few proud workers chiseled their initials and the date into their handiwork, most reading the date of Rinannimas, 6th month, 61st day, year 313. Bright banners flutter in the breeze on both sides of the bridge as if in celebration of it's victory over both the river's truculence and sabotage.

A massive stone bridge spans a raging grey tinted river as it runs it's course towards the southeast. The mud around the bridge footings has been churned by wheels of quarry wagons, tracks of sleds bearing block and tackle, shod hooves of draft beasts and booted feet of masons and bridge workers. The newer parts of the huge bridge are obvious due to the contrast in colors of mortar and rock. Bright banners snap briskly in the wind from both ends of the bridge.  A broken wooden wagon is here.

A brown and white osprey soars above the raging river, scanning the water for a meal. Suddenly, it dives down to the surface and snatches a rather large trout from the water.

On the northern edge of the road stands a tall, flat rock. Chipped into the shape of a pillar and abraded to smoothness, it bears the stamped surveyor's mark of the road's builder. The mark's grooved letters are filled with sand and dust and obscured from age, but the arrows delineating north, south, east and west are clear and easy to read. The rest of the stamp is undecipherable and lends mystery to the road's origin.

Boulders stacked in pyramids contained by large timbers stand mutely to the side of the roadway next to an impromptu dump of broken tools, wooden stakes and empty buckets lined with mortar. Deeply grooved sled tracks lead to the east towards the bridge from this part of the road where the flatness of the valley was best suited for the staging area during the bridge's reconstruction. Smooth rectangles of tent foundations still mark their location in a semi circle around a blackened fire ring where the workers and their supervisors lived during it's rebuilding.

The decaying remains of the bridge workers camp sprawls across this flat valley. To house their draft beasts, the workers constructed small stalls and shelters from rickety boards nailed quixotically to the standing trees. Three brass ring topped posts lie sunk into the grasslands turf, to the south, which was most likely used for tethering grazing animals. Between the posts is a rough stone trough that is filled automatically with water by a rickety mechanical wind mill, whirling lazily in the breeze.

Running parallel to the road is a smooth rock lined trench that channels the road's run-off during rainstorms. This flat part of the road that follows the valley floor would be prone to turn into a muddy bog and therefore a hazard to most caravans and their pack animals. Anticipating this event, the road's engineers built drains into the lower side of the road that carry the runoff into the culvert, which carries it harmlessly down to the low end of the valley.

Thicker stalked grasses grow here on this high plateau where the air is rarified and rain spills quickly down the small rocky gullies. A few staunch oaks grow alone or in groups of one or two, their roots exposed where they cling to the rocky soil for sustenance. Thin, scraggly junipers suck up what little moisture the soil does manage to hold. The merchant road placidly passes by, untouched by time in the dry environment.

Bright green trees and healthy bushes stand out sporadically on the dusty steppe. The little spring fed islands are surrounded by the blue-green grasses that thrive here. All manner of beasts are drawn to the springs and the protection they offer. Bright blue scrub jays chatter noisily among themselves as they dart and swerve in accomplished aerial feats pursuing their winged insect meals. A small herd of wary jackrabbits stop munching the grass to turn their white ears towards the merchant road. The nearest jack to the road stands on his hind legs and tests the air for any scent of their many predators.

Blending perfectly with the muted hues of the arid surroundings, a lone timber wolf stalks the outer edges of the grassland about a half a mile from the merchant road. The wolf's ears are perked to listen for the rustling of the bushy tailed jack rabbits that thrive in the prairie. The wolf lifts it nose to catch a scent, howls briefly and trots off towards the southeast to catch it's prey from downwind.

Sharp yipping pierces the cold, quiet air from both sides of the road: the hunters. The widely spaced junipers, scrub oaks, and mountain hawthorns offer ample cover for the pack of wolves to range unseen through the plateau.

From here, it is possible to observe an astounding 360 degree vista of the towering mountains to the north, the thick oak forest to the southeast, and more dry grasslands to the south and west. The terrain buckles and bends towards the north like a giant rug of trees and rocks had been pushed towards a wall of solid rock.

Small cracks run parallel to the road, but none have broken through the thick layers of sand and stone.

The momentous forces that have wrought this valley still press upon the land and have done so for eons.  The walls of the valley are sheer and steep, and untouched by the raging waters of river or stream.  As if in testimony to the power of the forces that move the land, a huge dark boulder sits off to the side of the road. It is hewn in half like a sliced melon.  One part sits 20 feet north along the break in the rocks from the other part.

Sheer, monolithic cliffs dropping for thousands of feet front the western edge of the mountains; their sharp, snow-capped peaks vaulting nearly vertically from the floor of the fault line valley. The merchant road bed is cracked and broken as it negotiates the larger twists and turns.

As the merchant road approaches the western end of the valley, the valley wall abruptly falls away to a sheer drop. Crumbling rock and dirt spill constantly into the deep abyss. Sections of the mountain have slid away into the valley and the merchant road has been rebuilt higher along the steeper sides of the mountain. The fault line of broken rocks continues its path of destruction to the west, skirted by the land-slide prone softer dirt.   A freshly uncovered crevice is here.

Many attempts have failed at conquering the shifting dirt and rocks. Currently a bumpy trail skirts the bigger rocks and loose gravel.

To the north, a landmark of sorts allows travelers a point from which to reconoiter their path. A mount of rocks that resembles the beak of a large bird marks the northern rim of the crater. Southbound traffic must rely on their wits to reach the badlands beyond the chasm.

Even at its deepest, some twenty feet plus, the river bed is a sparkling spectacle of long ago left deposits of minerals. The river shore offers a multicolored, faceted, and slippery path of mineral clusters, owing their origin to years of evaporation of the river water.

The sinuous river flows swiftly at its center channel, while the shores are licked by the ebb and tide of the crystal clear water. Even at its deepest, some twenty feet plus, the river bed is a sparkling spectacle of long ago left deposits of minerals. The river shore offers a multicolored, faceted, and slippery path of mineral clusters, owing their origin to years of evaporation of the river water.

Patches of fiery flame writhe and wiggle upon the cavern floor of this underground habitat. A swift flowing river snakes its way in and out of the towering stalagmites and stalactites. Small, dancing tongues of crimson and orange flame burn brightly on the river shores, the crystalline mineral deposits, and even the river itself. A faint glow comes from the southeast corner, while sounds of falling water echo from northeast.  Some slick worn stone steps are here.

This vantage point offers an expansive view of the boiling river snaking through the underground cavern. From the northeast, east, and southeast, small streams flow from points unseen to converge into the river proper. At its widest, the river spans some one hundred feet across, while at its narrowest it is perhaps ten feet wide. Bursting hot water bubbles are not the only thing to disturb the river surface. Plated tails, elongated horns, and green-scaled heads with blazing, fiery eyes all break the surface periodically. In the depths of the main channel, orbs of crimson flame dart back and forth.

Sometime ago, a large portion of the east wall cracked and fell, destroying many of the stalagmites that had once stood tall. The slab of earth lies slightly elevated at one end, giving shelter from falling debris and water.

A hole about five feet in radius provides an opening in the subterranean ground ahead. All about the opening into inky blackness cluster jagged and spiked crystalline deposits of minerals. When viewed from different angles, each crystal mass displays a different color of the spectrum. Water constantly drips from the cavern ceiling several hundred feet above, soaking the surrounding ground and the jagged deposits, before dripping down into the abyss.  An empty bottle of viscous black ichor, an open baggy sack, a large sparkling onyx bead, a small black jade charm, a translucent grey pearl, and an empty bottle of viscous black ichor are here.

Several three-toed tracks, Y-shaped and relatively human sized, mark the ground littered with rotting fungus, vegetation, scales and fish bones. Long trails of a single line are apparent between pairs of the aforementioned tracks. The barely eaten carcass of an aquatic creature lies discarded nearby. It resembles a large, scaled lobster, with pincers on each of its eight legs, and a wickedly curved, spiked tail. Whatever preyed upon this scorpion stone lobster took only the head for a meal.

The expansive cavern is both hot and humid, surprising for the elevation of the mountains above it. The river of boiling water lends to the constant condensation and dripping of water off the tips of stalactites.

The mineral deposits that line the shore are constantly kept wet by the popping and bursting of the boiling bubbles. This also serves to further the growth of the clusters, as the water evaporates to leave behind its dissolved crystals.

The expansive cavern is both hot and humid, surprising for the elevation of the mountains above it. The river of boiling water lends to the constant condensation and dripping of water off the tips of stalactites. Some have nearly completed their pillar partnerships with matching stalagmites, while others have just begun the several hundred foot journey.  A small cloudy red jade bead and an open sturdy wool pouch are here.

Patches of fiery flame writhe and wiggle upon the cavern floor of this underground habitat. A swift flowing river snakes its way in and out of the towering stalagmites and stalactites. Small, dancing tongues of crimson and orange flame burn brightly on the river shores, the crystalline mineral deposits, and even the river itself. A faint glow comes from the southeast corner, while sounds of falling water echo from northeast.  Some slick worn stone steps are here.

The sinuous river flows swiftly at its center channel, while the shores are licked by the ebb and tide of the crystal clear water. Even at its deepest, some twenty feet plus, the river bed is a sparkling spectacle of long ago left deposits of minerals. The river shore offers a multicolored, faceted, and slippery path of mineral clusters, owing their origin to years of evaporation of the river water.  A weathered amethyst is here.

Several three-toed tracks, Y-shaped and relatively human sized, mark the ground littered with rotting fungus, vegetation, scales and fish bones. Long trails of a single line are apparent between pairs of the aforementioned tracks. The barely eaten carcass of an aquatic creature lies discarded nearby. It resembles a large, scaled lobster, with pincers on each of its eight legs, and a wickedly curved, spiked tail. Whatever preyed upon this scorpion stone lobster took only the head for a meal.

The top third of a fifty foot stalagmite spire is encircled several times by the tail of a fiery salamander. From the waist up, the amphibious creatures appears as a green skinned humanoid, with spikes along the arms, spine, and head. The arms end in a three digit hand, with long sharp claws. From the waist down, the resemblance to anything human ends; a tail twice as long as its torso, with alternating red, green, and black scales, and rigid plates along the spine complete the creature. Eyes that seemingly bleed fire from their sockets watch your every move.

The southern part of this subterranean cavern is a maze of nearly completed pillars of stalactites. Navigating between the towering columns eventually leads to a glade of half-foot tall morel. The edible fungi's veinlets are sunken in and the spaces between elevated, producing a wrinkled effect. A faint azure glow radiates from the individual stalks of each morel, illuminating the mossy-floored glade.

This vantage point offers an expansive view of the boiling river snaking through the underground cavern. From the northeast, east, and southeast, small streams flow from points unseen to converge into the river proper. At its widest, the river spans some one hundred feet across, while at its narrowest it is perhaps ten feet wide. Bursting hot water bubbles are not the only thing to disturb the river surface. Plated tails, elongated horns, and green-scaled heads with blazing, fiery eyes all break the surface periodically. In the depths of the main channel, orbs of crimson flame dart back and forth.

A hole about five feet in radius provides an opening in the subterranean ground ahead. All about the opening into inky blackness cluster jagged and spiked crystalline deposits of minerals. When viewed from different angles, each crystal mass displays a different color of the spectrum. Water constantly drips from the cavern ceiling several hundred feet above, soaking the surrounding ground and the jagged deposits, before dripping down into the abyss.  An empty bottle of viscous black ichor, an open baggy sack, a translucent grey pearl, and an empty bottle of viscous black ichor are here.

Ankle deep waters offer a clear reflection of crystalline spears that grow from the cavern's ceiling. Drops of water fall from above creating ripples that gently race across the serene surface of the shallow, underground lake.

A hole about five feet in radius provides an opening in the subterranean ground ahead. All about the opening into inky blackness cluster jagged and spiked crystalline deposits of minerals. When viewed from different angles, each crystal mass displays a different color of the spectrum. Water constantly drips from the cavern ceiling several hundred feet above, soaking the surrounding ground and the jagged deposits, before dripping down into the abyss.  An empty bottle of viscous black ichor, an open baggy sack, a translucent grey pearl, and an empty bottle of viscous black ichor are here.

[Underground cavern.]

This vantage point offers an expansive view of the boiling river snaking through the underground cavern. From the northeast, east, and southeast, small streams flow from points unseen to converge into the river proper. At its widest, the river spans some one hundred feet across, while at its narrowest it is perhaps ten feet wide. Bursting hot water bubbles are not the only thing to disturb the river surface. Plated tails, elongated horns, and green-scaled heads with blazing, fiery eyes all break the surface periodically. In the depths of the main channel, orbs of crimson flame dart back and forth.

Several three-toed tracks, Y-shaped and relatively human sized, mark the ground littered with rotting fungus, vegetation, scales and fish bones. Long trails of a single line are apparent between pairs of the aforementioned tracks. The barely eaten carcass of an aquatic creature lies discarded nearby. It resembles a large, scaled lobster, with pincers on each of its eight legs, and a wickedly curved, spiked tail. Whatever preyed upon this scorpion stone lobster took only the head for a meal.

The expansive cavern is both hot and humid, surprising for the elevation of the mountains above it. The river of boiling water lends to the constant condensation and dripping of water off the tips of stalactites. Some have nearly completed their pillar partnerships with matching stalagmites, while others have just begun the several hundred foot journey.  An open sturdy wool pouch and an open slender doeskin bag are here.

Steam tendrils rise lazily off the flowing river. The shallows and river edge churn and bubble, a testament to the extreme temperature of the water. The mineral deposits that line the shore are constantly kept wet by the popping and bursting of the boiling bubbles. This also serves to further the growth of the clusters, as the water evaporates to leave behind its dissolved crystals.

This vantage point offers an expansive view of the boiling river snaking through the underground cavern. From the northeast, east, and southeast, small streams flow from points unseen to converge into the river proper. At its widest, the river spans some one hundred feet across, while at its narrowest it is perhaps ten feet wide. Bursting hot water bubbles are not the only thing to disturb the river surface. Plated tails, elongated horns, and green-scaled heads with blazing, fiery eyes all break the surface periodically. In the depths of the main channel, orbs of crimson flame dart back and forth.

[Town Square Center.]

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.   A flowing white marble fountain, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a marble statue of a Human, a carved marble statue of a Dragon, a rosewood sign, some flower embedded smelly black droppings, and an empty cheap tankard of foaming ale are here.

This area is illuminated.

The elegant Hotel Royale towers above the street, its emerald door sparkling in the light. The patrons that stroll in and out are catered to, doors opened and closed for them, and baggage and packages carried by harried servants. The large Bank of Spur sits on the east side of the square. Its location close to the Royale is not a coincidence. A gold-trimmed door is proof of the success of this branch of the Spurian bank and those who run it.  An elegant gold-trimmed walnut door, open emerald steel door, and a street lantern are here.

The elegant Hotel Royale towers above the street, its emerald door sparkling in the light. The patrons that stroll in and out are catered to, doors opened and closed for them, and baggage and packages carried by harried servants. The large Bank of Spur sits on the east side of the square. Its location close to the Royale is not a coincidence. A gold-trimmed door is proof of the success of this branch of the Spurian bank and those who run it.  An elegant gold-trimmed walnut door, open emerald steel door, and a street lantern are here.

They prevent any pets from entering and keep out all but the quickest or sneakiest of the riffraff. A narrow passageway leads to the stables.  An open emerald steel door is here.
