>[Market, Golden Tree Center.]

A massive, golden oak, tree stands tall and proud in the center of the market. Deep black scorching marks cover its base, scars of battle and history of this tree. The local merchants have planted small ivy vines at the base, which have slowly inched up the trunk. Benches and tables fashioned from fallen and burnt trees line the flowering center of the market, offering a refreshing place to relax while out for a day of shopping.  A giant golden oak tree covered in vines, some creeping green ivy vines, some carved burnished wooden benches, and a flower edged stone lined pathway are here.

This area is illuminated.
Obvious paths: northeast* east* southeast* southwest* west* northwest*.
