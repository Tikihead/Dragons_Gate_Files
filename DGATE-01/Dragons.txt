[Circular Pit, Dragon Cavern.]

A winding tunnel opens above a large depression in the cavern floor. A wide ledge spirals its way down the contour of the circular pit, narrowing as it approaches the flat bed of the bottom. The upper concentric circles of the ledge accommodate several rocks. The large rocks are not made of the abundant sandstone of the caves; rather, they are chiseled obsidian. Most have narrow slits for claw perches, while some are crudely hewn into bowl shapes for seating. Sound reverberates magnificently within the bowl, causing any sound above a whisper to carry to any point in the chamber.   A ledge winding downward, a giant glossy black obsidian rock, a giant glossy black obsidian rock, a slick mottled obsidian bowl-shaped rock, a slick mottled obsidian bowl-shaped rock, a round carved sandstone tunnel mouth, and a light chain linked steel haubergeon are here.
