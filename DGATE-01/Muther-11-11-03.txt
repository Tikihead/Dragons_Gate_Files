[Tiruna's Garden.]

A simple red pavestone path leads from the front gate through a garden of colorful flowers and fragrant herbs. A small fountain bubbles merrily in the middle of the garden. A sturdy oak bench lies almost hidden between some bushes next to the fountain. The path ends at the glass-paneled front door of a wood and stone cottage. Some delicate wind chimes by the front door send beautiful notes ringing through the garden.  A fountain, a closed wrought iron gate, and a closed glass paneled door are here.

This area is illuminated.
