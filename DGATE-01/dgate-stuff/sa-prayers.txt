PRAISE SA
~~~~~~~~~~~


Where shall the Magick be found?

Not in the streets nor caves nor halls,

Not on the sea or the Islands or deserts,

It lives in the bosom of Sa...

All Praise his name



Who has walked the world since the beginning of tyme?

Not a human, not a runemage, nor a Dragond, nor a San..

Not the mortal ones with their tether of age..

Sa has walked thru the wynds of Magick..

All praise his wisdom..



What lyte have we, from the ancient tymes,

What guides our thoughts and opens our eyes..

What wynds did blow thru our mortal viens,

Twas the wynd of Magick, that touched our lives..

And Sa is the God of that plane...

All hail to Sa...



Who shall live without magick?

Who shall heal and protect and slay,

Who shall know the feel of a translocation,

Who shall keep a Dragond safe thru stage?

Who of all of us can live without his gift?

And who shall bring us from this darkend tyme?

Let us call out his Name!...

Praise Sa!



A Prayer before Sleep
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I lay me down, upon my bed,

I pray to Sa to guard my soul,

And place His blessings upon my head,

Watch over me, and keep me whole,

While spirit wanders in body's stead,

Through realms of magick, high and low,

And if life from this body is bled

Come morning, I pray Sa, call me home.


Sa is my Master
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Sa is my master, I shall not weep,
His guiding hand rests on my head
He shelters my body when I sleep,
His magick is my daily bread.

Sa is my master, I shall not want,
His gentle runes infuse my life,
I drink from the wellspring of his Magick's font,
His blessings comfort me in tymes of stryfe.

Sa is my master, I shall not fear,
Though enemies surround me, dark and fell,
I feel his comforting presence near,
His spirit resides in each magick spell.

Sa is my master, I shall not fail,
Though the way before me is long and hard,
I call His name when my heart doth quail,
His magick restores me, and is my guard.

Sa is my master, In him I trust,
No other Gods shall comfort me,
Nor any other shall before him be thrust,
I shall live with Sa for eternity.


A Traveler's Prayer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


May the wynds rise to meet you,

May the sun be ever upon your face,

May you find a path in the wilderness,

May you find shelter from the storms,

May your pleasures be many, and your troubles few,

And, until we meet again,

May Sa hold you in the folds of His cloak.


The Prayers of the Faithful
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


I pray Sa Strengthen me,
Make my body fresh and vigorous.
I pray Sa Heal me,
Take my tattered body and make it whole.
I pray Sa Hide me,
Keep me from the sight of my enemies.
I pray Sa Shield me,
Guard my life from those who would harm.
I pray Sa Protect me,
Keep my heart, and my soul in Your care.
I pray Sa for your Blessings,
May your spirit be infused within.
I pray Sa for Ressurection,
Let those who have died feel your renewing touch.

Saian Triskele
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With Integrity do I approach you Sa,
That I might do your will, with all my
strength, and courage, and soul.

With Honor do I appraoch you Sa,
That I may be humble when doing your works,
Proud when I call upon your name, and
responsibile when I use your magick.

With respect do I approach you Sa,
That I might know the awesome power you wield,
Feel the wonder of the runes upon my body,
And allways uphold the tenets you have set for me.

The Warding Prayer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the begining was Sa,
And from the glorious mind of Sa came all else.

In this place made sacred by his hand,
I call the spirits of the land.
Great and small, we welcome all,
Attend this palce, by the Great Sa blest,
Leave your troubles, and be at rest.

Fathers and Sons, Mothers and Daughters,
I call the sprirts of the waters,
By river and lake, by fountain and stream,
Let the waters of life feel His magick's gleam.

Let all within feel the Lord Sa's grace,
Fire and Flame, I call you to this place.
Guard and protect, defend and obey,
And light our steps upon His way.

Let all stand amazed, both man and beast,
I call upon the wynds, North, South, West and East.
May no one fear the guardians of air,
For Sa with his magick has them under his care.

Earth my body,
Water my blood,
Fire my spirit,
Air my breath,

Let all who are gathered fear neither life nor death,
We call the elements great amd small,
We call upon Sa, Lord over them all.

In the beginning was Sa,
And from the mysterious mind of Sa came all else...

A Blessing of Gatherings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sa , I ask that you look down upon all gathered here,
Observe and witness this ryte and the spirit in which it is performed.

We ask for your blessing and guidance in this undertaking.
Know that our hearts are pure, and that we are
the true believers of your people.

We come before you to renew our sacred bond, the gift of magick.
If it please you, bestow your blessings upon us, and
renew our faith.

We dedicate our lives to your service, our hearts to your ways,
and our magick to your will, may all we do in this tyme
and this place please you.

We ask your blessings for ourselves and our loved ones,
on this occasion, and for the tymes to come.
Let all who are gathered here bend their knee,
to the God of Magick, and Bless'd Be.

Grace
~~~~~~~

Sa bless this bounty set before us,
As at this table we are met,
Bless friends and family gathered 'round us,
And from this feasting may we get,

Strength of body, spirit and mind,
All good things to keep us complete,
And may we grow strong, and loving and kind,
As we share your blessings at this gentle fete.


In Praise of the God of Magick
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ascribe to great Sa, O families of peoples,
Ascribe to great Sa, All glory and strength,
Bring Him an offering, donations to temples,
Worship Great Sa in holy array!

Serve Sa with humility, and with gladness,
Come into his presence singing his praise,
Let the faithful rejoice even in sadness,
Great Sa will give comfort, live in his grace.

Hearken to Sa, O you of the people,
Stand in awe of his powerful reign,
His magick is like the mightiest steeple,
In Sa is your fastness, all worship his name.

Sit at his feet, and know no darkness,
His light shall wash the blackest stains,
His power is joyous, mystical, marvelous,
Shout to the nations, The Lord Sa reigns!

The Gift of Magick
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Look, and it can't be seen,
Listen, and it can't be heard,
Reach, and it can't be touched,
Smell, and it has no scent.

Such is the Mystery of Sa's Magick.

Above, there is no light,
Below, there is no darkness,
Formless and unknowable, it exists as nothing.

Form that includes all forms,
Image without a shape,
Subtle, yet all powerful,
Being, yet not being...

Such is the Majesty of Sa's powers

Approach it and there is no beginning,
Follow it and there is no end,
You can't know it, but you can feel it,
You can't hold it, but you can use it.

Such is the Presence of Sa's gift.

It flows though all things,
Within and without,
Formless and perfect,
Solitary, unchanging,
Eternally present, Infinite..

This is the Magick, the great gift of Sa,
It holds all the power of the universe,
It flows through your body and infuses your mind.

This is the power you hold in your hands,
This is the power that flows through the lands,

Such is the gift of Sa, The gift of Magick.

In Sa's Presence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the revelers, with the crimson dawn,
Come join in circles upon the lawn,
To greet the daylyte with gentle song,
I'll sing my song to Sa.

Under spiritual skies of celestial blue,
'Neath stormy tides, or trees of yew,
When met in temple with a faithful few,
I'll spend my days with Sa.

When the darkened flame of setting sun,
Calls all to home when daytyme's done,
And Mothers the bedtyme stories have spun,
I'll pray my thanks to Sa

Whether it be night and in solitude,
Or in the street, in a multitude,
Whether richly clad, or glorious nude,
I'll allways be with Sa.

Requiem
~~~~~~~~~~

Under the twilight Spurian sky,
Upon a grassy knoll I'll lie,
A mossy stone to lay flowers by,
And a circle of friends to bid farewell.

This grave be laid under the heath,
A follower of Sa doth rest beneath,
The faithful come and place a wreath,
To honor one who heard death's knell.

Let words be scribed upon the stone
My life for Sa, now he calls me home,
My body rests, my spirit shall roam,
Who will remember me, time shall tell...
