Elegantly crafted moonstone sconces on each side of the entrance light this spacious jewelry store on even the darkest of evenings while the skylight overhead has been encrusted with several crushed diamonds, casting a rainbow glow throughout the building during the day. The abundance of light helps gives each gem the attention they need to show off their true color. The room itself is made of several black velvet topped glass counters that have been arranged into the shape of a horseshoe. Each counter is divided into two sections; one side for displaying lose gems and uncut stones, the other for finished jewelry that is ready to be sold. To the rear of the building is a small desk with a glowing rune-enscribed lamp sitting on it. The desk is cluttered with loose gems that have yet to be examined. A small bookshelf rises up from the back of the desk containing several books on gems and minerals. A single solid black book labeled "borrowed goods" has been tucked away at the end of the shelf.   An open diamond cut frosted glass door, a closed velvet topped glass counter, a closed velvet topped glass counter, a closed highly polished duskwood jewelry chiffonier, and some intricately carved teak chairs are here.

[Imports House Fantastico, Premier Branch.]

The black marble floor of this strange establishment has a glossy finish, but it casts little sheen. Inconsistent and irregular light flickers from candles placed strategically in mirrored niches around the establishment. The walls and ceiling are swathed with colored silks, in deep regal purples, blues and blacks, interwoven with shimmering metallic thread. A few brass incense burners also hang from the ceiling, emitting subtle but unrecognizable scents. Polished sandstone counters support some low glass and black velvet display cases, hosting strange and varied items. Towards the rear, a black lacquered desk is covered in oddly lettered scrolls, ink maps and intricate diagrams of unknown design. A purple robed go-blin-al pours over the desk, glancing up on occasion to answer a customer's question.   A closed saltwater stained lemonwood sea chest, a closed saltwater stained lemonwood sea chest, and an open exotic sliding mahogany door are here.

Softly glowing golden orbs float about illuminating the shop with a mystical light. Runes embedded in the store's stucco walls blink and glitter adding life to their dark crimson paint. Polished mahogany shelves showcase the organized assortment of magickal trinkets and weapons while a glass display case boasts a collection of potions and other concoctions. A large attendant stands protectively in front of a locked cabinet filled with dangerous looking items. He keeps a watchful eye on a pair of Frontacian children chasing each other around with crackling display wands as their parents browse about oblivious to their actions.  A closed large rune lit glass cabinet and a twinkling rune beaded curtain are here.

The air is uncomfortably warm in the cramped store. Clothing fills nearly every corner of the dim room; spilling over shelves, crowding racks, and piling in corners and on stools. The majority of the clothing hangs with little sign of order on a wooden rod that runs along one side of the long, thin space. Gilded antique mirrors adorn every unoccupied bit of wall. The back of the store hosts a cluster of pedestals of varying heights, a pair of shoes adorning each one. A few carefully placed sconces provide just enough light to illuminate select pieces of merchandise and cause the polished teak floor to gleam. A few well-dressed mannequins are placed inconveniently throughout the area causing further crowding amongst shoppers. Muffled voices giving opinions on outfits can be heard from behind the dressing room curtain. A Sanene woman lurks in the shadows waiting to assist you.  A well dressed mannequin, a pair of crystal pumps on a pedestal, a large antique gilded mirror, and an open serpent handled teak door are here.

The filtered light from the window barely reaches through to the room. A few floating candles hover in the air providing minimal light where the window cannot. The shades of light dance upon the mountains of books that fill this room. From ceiling to floor, this store has been filled to the brim with all sorts of books: ancient looking leather bound books whose bindings have come loose, mysterious dark tomes, covered in ancient runes, and thick codices of lore and history from times long past. Volume upon volume have been stacked high forming large columns of books. The labyrinth of tomes conceals a stairway leading down to a wooden door. In the back, a wrinkled old Usil sits quietly behind the counter reading a book of his own.  Some tall stacks of books, a closed glass framed mahogany bookshelf, an open rune crested wooden door, and a closed silver rune-etched mahogany door are here.

The sweet smelling aroma of fresh cut roses combined with fragrant scented oils from a nearby display table greets visitors romantically as they enter the store. Several small tables draped in shiny black silks have been set up around the shop, each showing off a certain theme of items. A single rack of clothing in the rear offers a sexy selection of evening wear that is sure to compliment the oils and lotions on display at the front of the store. A drawn velvet curtain offers privacy to customers wanting to try on some of the more revealing outfits. A soft glow from the many candles throughout the room adds to the seductive atmosphere. A lovely delicately elven maiden smiles warmly at you from behind the counter, waiting to assist your every need. Just behind her is a wide assortment of fine wines and breathtaking goblets designed for romantic evenings. The counter is filled with rich chocolates and other sensual foods that are sure to set the mood no matter what the occasion.  A closed glass topped mahogany case and an open ruby encrusted arched door are here.

Clear crystal display cases sit interspersed on gold-veined black marble flooring, giving a perfect view of items for sale. A soft charming glow reflects from rune symbols embedded in the darkened cherry wood walls. Tiny crystal prisms dangle from the ceiling, catching the light as they stir faintly from a mysterious unseen wind that lightly circulates around the store. The only things out of place in this elegant environment are paintings on the walls of a Leuian and a lawn gnome in various locations as well as a lawn gnome in the front of the shop, with a card in front of it entitled, "Dufus."  A brightly painted grinning lawn gnome and an open darkened cherry wood door are here.

[Raptorian's Sugar and More.]

To one side of the room are several large barrels filled to the very top with sugar. The air is filled with the smell of the many kinds of sweets, pastries, and confections contained within the shop's main counter, which is made of large panels of blue sapphire, set in a golden frame and cut thinly enough to be transparent, lending a slight bluish tinge to the goods contained within. Behind the counter, a drake-shaped blue statue sits on a shelf below a large banner, which reads, "Why go to Rathan or Saldaea for your sweet needs when I provide them right here?" Below this banner, a smaller one reads "Sugar is not the only thing sold here." Next to the statue is a small disclaimer set in a sapphire frame. Hanging from the ceiling is a large, stuffed, fuzzy, winged pink oliphant.  A blue statue of a drake, a disclaimer sign, and an open oliphant etched sapphire door are here.

Cool gold-flecked crimson marble covers the floor in this elegant shop. Tall displays of armor line two of the four walls. The other two walls are lined with walnut display cases. Beautiful weapons sit within the large cases cushioned by black velvet. Hanging on the walls behind the weapon cases are a variety of shields. Each distinctive for its design and durability. A tiny drag-al sits high on a stool, slowly swishing his tail, he eyes the customers waiting for any sign they may have a question.  An open ruby-studded dragon-etched steel door is here.

Warm homey scents assail your senses as you wander in to this quaint shop.  Simmering potpourri pots placed through out the room are the source of these comforting scents. The comfortable feelings that surround you make you want to linger in this cheerfully cluttered shop. A small sapphire winged Secian statue stands near the door, cheerfully holding a sign that says, "Welcome all shoppers." The shop owner's eclectic tastes are illustrated with the variety of items for sale. Along one wall are musical instruments of all kinds, along with sheet music and carrying cases. Bags of every shape and size imaginable are found on racks and shelves in the back of the show area. Shields of all types are displayed behind the counters, some simple, some ornate and polished, all ready to serve as a strong defense against assailants. The display cases are filled with all kinds of shiny trinkets and knick-knacks that glitter and sparkle in the bright light of the sapphire glass lanterns hanging from the ceiling.  A sapphire winged Secian statue, a glass covered display case, and an open sapphire inlaid bluesteel door are here.

[The Vistalique Revelryy.]

Entering you are greeted with the most fantastic aroma of distant recipes and exotic ingredients wafting through the air. Fragrant and strangely shaped brass oil lamps hang from the ceiling, casting ample but irregular light below. The walls are draped in bright velvets and interwoven with swirling burnished gold and silvers. On top of the etched sandstone and silken-carpeted flooring, a wide variety of brass and copper tables and adjoining chairs invite you to sit and enjoy a drink. Luckily there are a few unoccupied tables, as discerning customers have already claimed many. In the corners, booths skillfully draped with cloth ensure privacy from prying eyes. In the back an exotically clad go-blin-al chats with patrons from behind a copper topped counter, serving a wide variety of foreign food and drink. Nearby, soothing music streams from a talented pair of young musicians. You are just barely able to catch a glimpse of the flurry of activity in the kitchen through some flowing curtains behind the counter.  A copper topped glass counter, some dangerously tall copper barstools, some exotic style table and chairs, some orange pinstriped broadcloth reclining couches, and an open elegantly embossed copper door are here.

The soft hum of quiet conversation from a variety of patrons lends to the cheerful and rejuvenating ambiance of this quaint eatery. The scandalous aroma of fresh baked pastries and dark roasted coffees and tea spices wafts past you as a serving girl bustles by with a tray laden with orders. Several cozy booths line the far wall, while a half dozen sturdy tables with oak legs and circular glass tops are scattered about the smooth golden pine floor. A jovial, old Human man stands behind a highly polished marble counter tending to the large brick oven along the back wall. Another stands ready to take your order. A finely crafted hat and cloak rack is placed near the door.  Some glass topped tables, some mahogany booths, a marble counter, a hat and coat rack, and an open lacquered oak door are here.

Illumination from the dim oil lamps barely cuts through spilt drink and stale tobacco scented air.  A group of drag-als that seem to have become a permanent fixture here beckons you to join them for a pitcher of ale, and motions to the bartender indicating that you're paying.  Without bothering to acknowledge them, the bartender flashes a toothless grin toward a crowd more likely to have a few coins in their pockets, points them toward a table in the back and offers them an etched wood menu.  An open finely carved rosewood door, a small stage, and a slightly stained parchment placard on the bar are here.

[Tempting Trinkets and Treasures.]

An assortment of small locked glass display cases atop finely carved mahogany pedestals are placed about this shop. Each case contains a unique and exquisite piece of fine jewelry, polished to shine in the light cast by the large glowing crystal chandelier hanging from the center of the ceiling.  A locked glass-fronted duskwood case towards the rear of the shop is filled with figurines, some more ordinary looking jewelry and assorted collectibles. One of the pale grey walls is covered with a beautiful mural of a forest grove - a light fog flecked with gold swirls in an archway formed by the trees and in the center are two gleaming golden eyes, the form of the muscular tiger they belong to barely outlined in the fog. The other walls are hung with charts listing the properties of precious and semi-precious gems and metals and the various methods of gemstone cutting.  A soft midnight blue leather upholstered couch, an open smooth edged pine charity bin, and an open exquisite stained-glass door are here.

A bell above the door tinkles as you enter this cluttered shop. Light filters in through a dusty window and glints off various metals and gemstones around the room, a bright blue and purple glass mosaic lamp on the counter provides further illumination. Weapon and armor racks are scattered haphazardly around the room, though the most valuable are displayed on a pair of ornate racks in the center of the room. A glass-fronted curio cabinet against one wall allows for the display of jewelry, several lockpicks and an array of trinkets. The glass-fronted counter contains a number of carefully labeled bottles and jars. A tall, metallic silver-eyed youth clad in simple brown clothing apart from an ornate dragon-shaped bluesteel pendant sits on an old stool behind the cluttered counter, idly flipping through the pages of a book. Behind the shopkeeper atop a cluttered bookshelf is a heavy steelwood lockbox; deeply carved into its lid is an arcane rune that glows with a faint green light.   An open sturdy blackened oak door is here.

The scent of jasmine fills the air as you enter, a small incense burner near the door gives off a few small clouds of smoke. The front windows of the shop allow plenty of light from the street to enter and show off it's wares. A young leuian walks forward to greet you, his eyes sparkling as he bows deeply before asking if he may help you with anything. A jewelry case separates the work area of the shop from the front. Gems of all shapes and sizes adorn the work bench.  A closed transparent glass case, a closed black oak display shelf, and an open wooden door are here.

Boxes on boxes, boxes in boxes, sacks in boxes, jars in boxes, boxes in sacks, and even one box in a jar are piled everywhere! If it weren't for a frantic flerian with orange hair pointing out a safe path while shouting "Careful of Jixi's pretties, big feets!" you'd have likely turned an ankle by now. A magickal sphere floating near the ceiling changes color every few minutes but manages to cast ample light to examine the multitude of containers for sale.

[Bare Arsed Baboon Pawn & Saloon.]

Sawdust has barely settled on the floor and already rattan, pik, kobold, and go-blin-al alike are running amok. Mongrels of all breeds down tankards of booze while gambling on quick card games that, as a rule, end in violent bloodshed more often than not. The plinking of a tired old piano struggles to lend cheer to the lonesome atmosphere. Patrons here are quick to the draw. Wanted posters adorn the walls depicting many of their faces, serving for bragging rights rather than law officials. The bartender, a rather burly looking human with a thick mustache, stands behind the counter cleaning glasses with a rag and phlegmy wads of spit. A large crossbow mounted on the wall behind him remains loaded at all times, in case any of the patrons get too out of hand. With a reluctant nod, he motions towards shelves of items and a list of prices on the back wall.  An old Go-blin-al playing a piano, some crooked wooden tables, a dusty bar counter, some bolts stuck in the wall, a giant stuffed wall-mounted boar head, an old rickety wooden piano, a giant stuffed hairy baboon, and a pair of skull inlaid ebony swinging doors are here.

This dark room is faintly illuminated by barely burning wrought iron torches that line the damp pitch-black brick walls. Screams of various races can be faintly heard echoing through the room, apparently coming from behind the walls. A cold and eerie chill sweeps through your body making you grin with delight, or shiver with fright as you peruse the vast shelves or merchandise all that seem to appeal to your darker side. An attractive Sanene female wearing a wickedly spiked thorn choker and a full studded leather body suit stands behind a cold iron counter glaring at you through her hypnotic pitch black eyes.

A large, woven rush mat at the door welcomes you into a brightly lit shop.  The glossy golden pine floor and strategically placed mirrors on the walls gently reflect the light shed by dozens of different lamps, lanterns, and magikal illuminations.  A short, round, glass display case holds a selection of candles in a variety of hues and scents. Torches and lanterns are affixed to the walls in neatly spaced rows.  At the back of the shop a cheerful male Secian sits on a tall stool behind a mirrored counter.  Behind him float several magikal illumination orbs glowing a rainbow of different colors.   A glowing bright crimson paper lantern on a stick, a glowing Dragon patterned stained glass lantern, a glowing finely woven silver mesh cage of fireflies, and an opaque ruby red glass door are here.

[Traveler's Emporium.]

You enter a large room with items of all sorts arranged neatly in mahogany and gold-trimmed glass display cases. Deep amber velvet curtains, set against rich royal blue walls, are opened wide to let in light from the street. A large candlelit crystal chandelier hangs from the ceiling, illuminating the room with dazzling color. Beside the large arched double doors are two display cases which stand out amongst the rest. Plush burgundy chairs and mahogany coffee tables are throughout the store to sit and look around in comfort, or perhaps join a friend for a bite to eat from a neighboring store. A light scent of spicy incense fills the room, and the warm ambience lends itself to a rich shopping experience. Some of the items for sale are mundane, yet necessary parts of everyday life, while others have more exotic uses and origins. The shopkeeper, with a friendly smile, is ready to sell ones every desire.   A pair of large arched double-doors, a closed display case and sign, and a closed display and placard are here.

This room is illuminated.
You see the 1st foreign merchant.

Numerous items line the walls of this store. The middle of the room is kept clean and open. Towards the back of the store, a large glass counter filled with gems and trinkets. On the back wall, oiled and polished weapons are on display.  Sitting to the right, an oak armor stand holds several different sets of shining armor. To the left, a strong magickal aura is emitted from the many magickal items inside of a clear crystal case. Behind the counter, a young harried Leuian looks up and asks, "May I help you?"  A glass counter, an oak armor stand, a crystal case, a closed teak door, and an exit are here.

[The Tangled Web.]

The small crevice you entered through opens into a surprisingly large natural cavern. A heavily muscled matron arachnian clicks her mandibles at you challengingly from a ledge on the far wall, but doesn't move to attack. She eyes you warily instead, rythmically swaying her mandibles from side to side. Several glowing iron braziers of coal cast a steady glow, allowing easy inspection of the selection of goods securely webbed to the walls.   Some glowing iron braziers of coal, a closed thick grey steel armory, and a small crevice are here.
