Brilliantly carved flagstones lead up to the marble fountain dominating Spur's town square.  The fountain is ringed with small gargoyles that spit water in all directions, and has a grey pearl broadsword driven into the top.  Oil lamps have been placed strategically around the fountain to provide illumination during all hours of the day.  A broad tarp is stretched overhead to keep the rain out.  Some burlap sandbags, a welcome mat, a potted plant, a crack in the earth, some vomit, a spent wooden torch, a spent wooden torch, and an empty health potion are here.
