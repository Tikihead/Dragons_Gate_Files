    Staging of Lunaris

        Lunaris says, "If you wish."

        You hold Lunaris close.

        A number of tiny runes begin dancing above the head of Glinka!

        Berial squints at the shallow pool.

        A bright golden light swirls slowly around Lunaris!

        The healing aura slowly fades away.

        [Carniliana's Garden]

        The path opens into a small cavern filled with trees and flowers. Two large crystals in the ceiling provide light for the area. A small waterfall empties into a pool of crystal clear water, the overflow spills into a stream that heads northwest.

        This room is illuminated.
        You see the 1st husky (wearing a small gold collar) and the 1st ferret (wearing a small gold collar). In the room are Berial the Noble Secian, Litorth the Noble Drake, Yad the Secian, Chromius the Noble Draco, Lunaris the Noble Draco (seated), Sebbien the Draco, Starlyn the Noble Secian (holding a glowing mysterious crystal orb of truth), Blair the Noble Secian, Aliyah the Noble Secian, and Zuril the Noble Drake.
        Obvious exits: northwest*.

        Zuril snickers.

        Lunaris flinches.

        You hold Lunaris close.

        The ferret chases its tail.

        Lunaris bones start to snap and reshape.

        Sebbien sits down.

        Berial says in Secian, "I remember lots of stories about that pool"

        Berial nods up and down.

        Lunaris groans softly.

        Zuril winces.

        Litorth says, "just relax and endure tis the best advice I can offer"

        Lunaris just dropped a pearl imbedded silver goblet.

        Lunaris looks like a 6'0" standard 1st stage massive boned, very muscular bodied Dragon.
        She is seated.
        She has long, wavy, white hair, with silvery gray eyes, and looks orderly.
        She appears to be in a tired mood right now.
        She can be attacked by other players.
        She has no apparent injuries, but looks nearly dead and exhausted.
        There is a shining gold emblem affixed to her clothing.

        Physical appearance:

        She glances back at you for just a moment, a faint twinkle in her deep coal eyes. As she turns away you become aware of the gentle white glow which surrounds her, like the touch of the moon on a frosty winter meadow. Elated Chosen of Glinka

        Slowly, ever so slowly, this dragon stirs...

        A number of tiny runes begin dancing above the head of Glinka!

        [Carniliana's Garden]

        The path opens into a small cavern filled with trees and flowers. Two large crystals in the ceiling provide light for the area. A small waterfall empties into a pool of crystal clear water, the overflow spills into a stream that heads northwest. A pearl imbedded silver goblet is here.

        You beam.

        Glinka asks, "how they feel?"

        You pick up Twilight's mental link, "When?"

        With a powerful downstroke, Lunaris soars 15 feet into the air!

        You shriek.

        Chromius grins.

        Lunaris circles around and does some aerial acrobatics!

        You stand up.

        Lunaris says, "Lovely."

        You take a few steps and soar 10 feet into the air!

        Lunaris winks.

        You hold Lunaris close.

        Lunaris beams.

        Glinka exclaims, "careful!"

        Lunaris pulls you closer to her.

        You shiver.

        You pick up Berial's mental link, "Just a while ago"

        You climb 5 feet.

        You snuggle with Lunaris.

        Lunaris fans her wings at you.

        You pick up Twilight's mental link, "Oh."

        You giggle.

        Glinka exclaims, "Don't furl em!"

        Lunaris kisses you on the forehead.

        You shake your head from side to side.

        You beam.

        Lunaris grins broadly.

        Berial just placed a light cotton towel within her open silk beltpouch.

        You examine Berial the Secian...
        She has no apparent injuries, but looks tired.
        You examine Chromius the Dragon...
        He appears to be in perfect health.
        You examine Lunaris the Dragon...
        She appears to be in perfect health. You examine Zuril the Dragon...
        He appears to be in perfect health.

        Lunaris circles around and does some aerial acrobatics!

        Zuril says, "And don't hit your head."

        Glinka exclaims, "and watch your fatigue!"

        Lunaris says, "I'm too short to hit my head."

        Glinka says, "and and"

        You giggle.

        Chromius chuckles softly.

        Lunaris grins.

        Berial says, "Have fun."

        Berial nods up and down to you.

        Zuril says, "True..."

        You beam.

        Lunaris smiles warmly.

        Glinka exclaims, "thankies!"

        Chromius says to Lunaris, "enjoy the skies"

        Glinka asks, "shall we fly about?"

        Lunaris says, "I need to get rid of all this platinum stuff..."

        You fly down 5 feet.

        Lunaris chuckles merrily.

        You fly down 5 feet.

        You giggle.

        You request that Chromius join your group.

        Lunaris descends 10 feet.

        Lunaris pulls Chromius closer to her.

        You smile softly.

        Chromius is following you.

        [Carniliana's Garden]

        The path opens into a small cavern filled with trees and flowers. Two large crystals in the ceiling provide light for the area. A small waterfall empties into a pool of crystal clear water, the overflow spills into a stream that heads northwest.

        Chromius nuzzles you.

        Glinka asks, "anyone else wanna go?"

        You giggle.

        Glinka says, "we can Swoop over the tsc"

        You giggle.

        You cough.

        You beam.

        Lunaris grins.

        Lunaris says, "Sounds good."

        Glinka asks, "ready?"

        Berial waves.

        You beam.

        Lunaris nods.
