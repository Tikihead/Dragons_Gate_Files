The buildings of Market Circle stand to the south. It becomes obvious that the area through the arch is a much cleaner marketplace than the bazaar. An inviting eatery stands beside the road, its door open to those weary after a long trip to Spur, as well as those preparing to venture to the great expanses beyond the west gate. A human couple exit the building, arm in arm. A small sign stands beside the intersection.  A sign, an open glossy lacquered mahogany door, and a street lantern are here.

People carrying bundles stream in from the west and rapidly lose themselves in the large crowds moving about in the vast town square.

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.   A flowing white marble fountain, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a cracked marble statue of a Human, a carved marble statue of a Dragon, a rosewood sign, a small jagged cobblestone crack, a welcome mat, and a spent marshmallow on a stick are here.

The traffic on the northern street heading away from town square is an eclectic bunch.  Those who belong to the guilds to the north travel in packs on their way to and from guild events.

Beds of wildflowers line the carefully placed cobblestones along this street. A pair of love birds, cooing in delight, sit upon a white marble bench.

A peaceful bliss pervades the very core of this guilded path. Below a large oak tree a couple of Rinannian priestesses sing lightly in Secti. Several merchants pause to listen to the song.

The distant glimmer from a temple made of white marble and pearl catches your eye. An intricate gilded iron gate and a small winding path are all that separate you from the dazzling temple of Rinanni. Majestic marble statues of doves in flight stand on either side of the gate. The gaze of their peaceful eyes seems to follow your every movement.  An open intricately gilded iron gate, a pair of pure white marble dove statues, a street lantern, and an open dragon-etched emerald door are here.

A large stone building rises just to the east of Northern Avenue. These barracks house those known as Dread Knights.

If only they would stop fingering their swords all the time, you might believe it yourself.  A street lantern is here.

Northern Avenue ends at a gateway set within the massive city walls. On the other side of the gate are the Guild Halls.

The sounds of clashing steel and the calls of battle fill the air near the entrance to the Mercenary's Guild. Numerous hardened warriors lean up against the walls of the building waiting for job offers, while others move in and out of the guild hall going about their daily business. By the looks of it, some of the veterans are giving a barbarian near the front door a hard time.  An open white cedar door and a street lantern are here.

[Northern Avenue.]

A narrow steel gate leads through a short white stone wall. Beyond the gate lies the practice yard for the Mercenary's Guild. Novice mercenaries sit or stand outside the gate, either resting from their exertions or gathering their courage to enter. Piles of old bandages lie beside the road. Behind the practice yard, the incredible outer wall stands high above the city.  An open narrow grey steel gate, an open polished oak door, and a street lantern are here.
