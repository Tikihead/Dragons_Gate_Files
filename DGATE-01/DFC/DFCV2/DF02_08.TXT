Dear Readers,

Greetings, and welcome to issue #8 of the Dragon Fire Chronicle.  As you may have noticed, our staff list has grown considerably smaller upon the recent departure of two beloved columnists.  Esper Lyrian, our loyal society editor, has been sent off on a vacation of undetermined length (without even taking me along…hmph!).  Word of when he'll return is still pending-but trust me, he IS coming back, even if I have to go find where he's hiding and drag him back here.  Fearagoh Stalberdin, who has faithfully provided our readers with the Top 5s and Rise Of The Classes since I became Editor, has also taken his leave, and is no doubt packing off away from the city in search of deeper pockets to pillage.  Wherever they are, I would like to wish both of them the best of luck, and thank them deeply for the efforts they have put into making this publication what it is today.  You'll be missed, lads.

In other, happier news, we've quite a few good yarns to be spun on the pages of this month's issue.  I hope you all enjoy what is offered up here, and if you don't-well, by golly, submit something you do!  Keep your harpstrings dry and your inkwells damp, and  until next month, I remain . . .


Your humble Editor,
Marigold Lyrian

Sagely Wonderings
By Weldoian Sesca Oskaloq

"Month One: A traveling companion"

'Today, I leave the Spur; my home, in search of books, scrolls, etc., which is a necessity of being a Sage.  I'm not worried.  The Spur's survived without a Sage for hundreds of years and without me for many months, so a travel about the world will be no harm to the city.  The citizens can live normal lives, if you call life in the Spur normal, without me.  So, with my backpack full of food, water and my various special items, I see off towards the dock.  When I get there, I try to look up a ship with a far away destination.  That turns about to be Moldavia.  No one, but the extremely brave or extremely dumb, boards that ship.  I, for one, am neither.  So, with that the only ship to set sail, I ask to rent a ship.  I buy the best I can, which, to my joy, is a big one.  Enough, I hope, to hold my stuff.  Just as I prepare to set sail, a Leuian walks up to the ship.

"May I join you honorable Anthian?" asked he.

"Of course." I said, being nice as I usually am.

"My name is Onlig K'aborg, son of Humil K'aborg, young traveler." said he.

"Good day.  My name is Triam Poklas, son of Ukiah Pokals, Sage of the Spur." I responded with equal formality.

"Ah!  Greetings and my thanks, Great Sage Triam." said Onlig.

"Please, no formalities.  Tri is fine." I said.

Onlig nodded, got onboard, helped me raise the sail, and we were off.

Its been a week since me and Onlig left port.  And though he's a Leuian, a race who I know is extremely honorable, I can't help but to be suspicious of him.  Who wouldn't be?  He's one of the quiet, mysterious types.  But I do know that's he an extremely good fisher.  Caught lots of fish, and even a dolphin.  That should last us awhile.  He's also a great steersman.  He knows how to tell which way the wind is going, where to find flocks of bird and fish.  But, alas, no land.  And, what's worse, a storm is brewing some miles away to the east.  I can't tell if it'll hit us or not, but I do know, whether it hits or not, we will be going somewhere.


I don't know how long its been.  Onlig says three days, yet my body feels like its been three months.  The storm did hit us, unfortunately....made us lose the dolphin.  That's good for the dolphin at least.  Remarkably, we took little damage.  But, we were thrown extremely off course.  Wherever we were before the storm hit must be at least five hundred miles away because now we're in a natural harbor next to some land.  I told Onlig to land the boat thirty minutes ago.  Hopefully, there's people there that will be able to give us food....our supplies we brought with us are down as it is....'

"Tri?  We've landed." said Onlig.

"Thanks Onlig." Triam said.

"What we're you doing?" asked Onlig.

"Just reading my journal." said Triam.

"Oh.  Meet you on shore, then." said Onlig.

"Alright." said Triam.

Triam got up from his bed, grabbed his journal, put it in his backpack, and left his room.  He closed the door and headed for the deck.  As he came on top of the deck, he breathed the sea air.  It was refreshing to him.  He looked around, saw the island, saw the sea stretch to the horizon.  He turned and walked down the plank, leading to the shore.  He saw Onlig sitting on a log, watching the gulls dive for fish.

"Onlig?" asked Triam.

Onlig looked in Triam's direction.

"Hrm?" asked Onlig.	
	
"Ready?" asked Triam.

"Yes." responded Onlig.

Onlig stood up and walked over to Triam.  Together, they entered a forest of lush trees, wildlife and plants.	

"Do you know where we are?" asked Triam.

"No." answered Onlig.

"Great!" exclaimed Triam, reaching in his travel bag for a notepad and a quill.

"Why is it great, Tri?" asked Onlig.

"I get to do research on it!" said Triam, happily.	

Onlig just nodded and looked on.  The joys a Sage has thought Onlig.  He flexed his claws to make sure of no object blocking a quick claw unsheathing.  Triam started to write furiously.  Onlig looked in awe and curiosity.

"If you don't mind me asking, Tri, what are you writing about?"  asked Onlig.

"Everything I see, hear, and feel Onlig.  Its an amazing feeling to actually be the first to discover an unknown island." responded Triam.

"Oh." said Onlig.

The two continued through the forest with relative ease.  No underbrush at all.  No foilage in the way.  Just a clear, clean path right through the forest.

"Hrm...I have a feeling someone HAS been here before." said Onlig.

"Probably some pirates trying to bury their treasure or something.  Whatever it was, its probably long gone." said Triam.

"Or, at least, let's hope." said Onlig.

The two continued through the forest, not meeting anything out of the ordinary.  After an hour, they came to a clearing.  In the clearing was a house, smoke coming from the chimney.	

"Well.  So much for hoping that the pirates left." said Onlig.	

"Hrm...," said Triam, looking up, "Perhaps a nice person lives there."

"Doubt it." said Onlig.

"Let's go find out." said Triam, heading towards the hut.

"I've always hated it, but you do know that curiosity killed the Khat, right?" said Onlig.

"Ah, but I'm not a Khat.  Don't come if you don't want to.  I'm not pushing you." said Triam.

Onlig stood at the forest border while Triam went over to the house's door.  He knocked on the door and waited.  The door opened to reveal a San Elf.

"Who knocks on my door?" asked the San Elf.

"I am Triam, Sage of the Spur." said Triam.

"The Spur?  Hrm....there's a big distance between here and there for an Anthian to travel." said the San Elf.

"I'm traveling the world, gathering myths from local peoples, information, geography, et cetera." said Triam.

"And you come to my house because...?" asked the San Elf.

"Because, me and my friend, Onlig, are hoping to find a place in which we can replenish our supplies." said Triam.

"Onlig?" asked the San Elf.

Triam turned and pointed to Onlig.  "My friend." said Triam.

`"Hrm......you may come in.  But be warned....this place is haunted at night." said the San Elf.

"May I ask who you are?" asked Triam.

"I am Piko Yli'ka." said the San Elf.

"Greetings then, Piko." said Triam.

Piko merely grumbled and went back into his house.  Triam turned to Onlig's direction.

"Onlig!  Come on!" yelled Triam.

Onlig started running to Triam, stopping an inch from Triam's face.	

Triam laughed.  "Happy, there?" asked Triam.

"No.  I hurried because you could've been hurt." said Onlig.

Triam smiled.  

"Sure.  Piko is the house's owner.  And he said we could stay the night." Triam said.

Onlig nodded and entered the hut, followed by Triam.

"So...uh...Piko...is there a place to replenish supplies?  A market of some sort?" asked Triam.

"I will tell you in the morning.  If you survive the night, that is.  Goodnight!" said Piko, shutting his bedroom door.

Triam looked around and saw two other rooms, one lavishly decorated, the other hardly even furnished.
"Uh....your pick." said Triam.

Onlig headed over to the almost empty room.

"Goodnight Tri." said Onlig.

"Night, Onlig." said Triam, heading for the lavishly decorated room.  He closed his door, and heard Onlig do the same.  He got in his pajama's and went to sleep.


…To be continued.  Stay tune for next month's installment of "Sagely Wonderings"!

Top 5's
By Fearagoh Stalberdin

This month we had a larger variety of interesting categories due to the suggestions of many Spurians. Keep up the good work folks, and here are this months results.

Most Changed
1) Mestoffa
2) Michael
3) Changeman
4) Tula
5) Narcissus

Mestoffa won the title of Most Changed this time around. He has gone from a Priest of Taath to a very different person- an Arachnian Psion. Michael came in a close second, after staging into a black Dragon.

Most Individual
1) Konichiwa	
2) Fearagoh
3) Kassandra
4) Reason
5) Axe

For Most Individual, Konichiwa won it this time around. Konichiwa is very chaotic, er, unique, and has graced the Spur with her individual style. Closely behind her is yours truly, Fearagoh. I guess the old age has brought out some individuality in me.

Most Artistic
1) Marigold	
2) Allandra
3) Bitley

Only three people were voted for the Most Artistic category, though all of them very artistic in their own way. Marigold's singing and instrumental talent have graced Spur and the Guild of the Bards, with Allandra's poems, storytellings, and fashion bringing a flare of art to our city. Bitley came in a close third, with his accurate, artistic Fortune telling. 

Loudest Spurian
1) Kitsa		
2) Aros		
3) Blackcrow
4) Wesley		
5) Tenser	

Kitsa has the honor of being proclaimed Loudest Spurian! She can often be heard screaming something or other in Leuian around Town Square. Aros the wise-cracking Hithual came in second.

Best Gladiator
1) Lobos		
2) Methos		
3) Sordum		
4) Mestoffa
5) Tenser		

Best Gladiator this month came out as Lobos. Lobos has dominated games with his skill in webbing and weapons. Methos came in second, with his deadly claws and magick at that. Then Sordum, with his advanced Psionic skills, came in a close third. Fourth we have Mestoffa, the deadly combination of webbing and Psionic power. And last but not least, Tenser, flying close overhead, flinging magick spells and shredding with his claws.

I hope you enjoyed this months Top 5's! Please keep sending me suggestions so we can keep the topics interesting!

Best,
Fearagoh Stalberdin

Misunderstandings
By Cutter Strongblade


The tavern was quite busy that night, the rumor of a sale on their famous bread pudding had spread all throughout the Spur. The many who had actually ate some weren't going to pass this up, not even if an Imperial stood in front of their path. The others who had never tried them- the poor souls of Spur that didn't know what they were missing- found this the best opportunity to give it a try. Besides, they heard from friends that the bread pudding was legendary. It was too bad the sale was only a rumor. Even if it were so, the rumor was great for business. All those who came, decided to stay and eat since they made the trek all the way there, though they were quite disappointed. 

Arragon emerged from the kitchen carrying a full tray ale mugs, heading for the table occupied by four burly Thugians, near the back of the room. 

"Here you go" Arragon said, placing the tray on the table. The foam from the Hithual ale flowed over the top of the mugs and onto the tray. 

"Is there anything else you'd like?" he added. 

"No, that's it. Thank you" one of the men said, hiding his disappointment that the beautiful Harra wasn't the one serving them. 

Arragon smiled and headed for another table on the other end of the room. This time, it was occupied by four women. 

"Here he comes" one of the girls whispered to the others, suppressing a giggle. 

"Are you really going to do it, Katelin?" another asked, her eyes gazing on the incoming warrior. 

"Yes" Katelin answered, her heart beating faster as Arragon got closer. 

Arragon, now at the table, totally unaware of them talking about him, asked them about what they wished for. 

"Good evening ladies" he said, his voice making the four women queasy with delight "What would you like?" 

"Um...four orders of your bread pudding" Katelin said, her voice practically failing her. She giggled silently to herself, thinking of something else she wanted other than the pudding.

"Is that it?" he asked, his gaze on the most beautiful of the four, Katelin. 

"Yes. Thank you" she answered, unable to continue to look into those beautiful, caring eyes. 

Arragon smiled and headed for the kitchen. 

"Why didn't you do it, Katelin?" a third girl asked once Arragon was out of earshot. She had been quiet until now. 

"I couldn't. I was too nervous" she answered, her heart rate now slowing down to its normal speed. 

"Are you going to do it when he comes back?" the fourth girl asked, now joining in on their conversation. 

"Of course." 

~~~~~~~~~~

"Boy, it's so busy tonight" Arragon said to his wife, Harra. She nodded in accordance, smiling sweetly. The big warrior wiped the sweat from his forehead with a piece of cloth. He and Harra were in the kitchen and the heat from the stove was getting to him. Harra didn't even notice the heat. She was too busy cooking a batch of pudding. 

"Do you need any help, honey?" Arragon asked, placing his big hands around Harra's slender waist and kissing the nape of her neck. 

"No, I can handle it. Besides, I'm finished" Harra answered, turning the fire off of the stove. She quickly took hold of a large bowl and poured the pudding into it. 

"Here you go" she said, handing him four more bowls. 

"Thank you" Arragon said, kissing Harra full on the lips. He then reluctantly turned away from his lovely wife and headed back out. 

Once out of the kitchen, Arragon headed for the table. 

"Here you go" he said, placing the large plate in the center of the table. 

"Thank you" Katelin said. What she did next caught Arragon by surprise. 

Before the big warrior had time to react, she got out of her chair and hugged him tightly, enjoying the warmth of his body. 

Inside the kitchen, Harra realized she forgot to give her husband some spoons. She quickly grabbed hold of four spoons and rushed out of the kitchen. She was shocked to see what was happening in the back of the room. She was infuriated to see Arragon hugging this woman. Actually, it was the woman hugging him, but Harra was too angry to notice. Besides, Arragon's back was to Harra, blocking off her view of what was really happening. Harra quickly turned to a man, seated by the bar, and asked him about who that woman was. 

"Who's that my husband is hugging?" she asked, her voice harsh, pointing towards the table. The man was momentarily taken aback at the coldness of her voice. He quickly turned his head to where she was pointing and recognized who the woman was. 

"Oh, that's Katelin" he answered 

"Katelin" she said "I'll remember that name" 

Harra headed back towards the kitchen, Katelin's name remembered. 

~~~~~~~~~~

"Please, I'm married" Arragon said, shocked to realize that a beautiful woman was hugging him. 

"I just wanted to thank you" Katelin said, not letting go, "For bringing our food." 

"You could of just said so" Arragon said, gently breaking out of Katelin's embrace. He was scared that Harra might come out of the kitchen and notice what was going on. He quickly turned his gaze around, towards the kitchen, hoping against hope that Harra didn't decide to come out, getting a eyeful of what had just transpired. 

"Good," Arragon thought, "she didn't see what happened." 

Arragon turned his gaze back towards the table and realized that he forgot to bring the spoons. 

"I'll be right back" he said. He turned around and headed for the kitchen. 

"Ha" Katelin said once Arragon was out of earshot, "I told you I'd do it." 

She held out her slender hand in front, happy to have won the bet. 

I wonder what that girl's name is, Arragon thought. She is pretty. But not nearly as pretty as Harra. He placed a hand on the door to open it. Right when he was about to go through the door, a Flerian grabbed hold of Arragon by his arm, quickly catching his attention. 

"Arragon" the man said, "It's me." Arragon looked at the man intently and immediately recognized him.. 

"Taran!" Arragon said, shocked to see the Flerian. He quickly picked Taran up off his tiny feet and hugged him with his massive arms, squeezing the air out of the hapless Flerian. 

"Hi Arragon" Taran said, gasping for air between words "It's good to see you" 

Arragon placed the Flerian back on his feet and gently patted Taran on his topknot. It's been quite a while since the two met, what, about several years. 

"How are you doing?" Arragon asked, quite happy to actually see the Flerian. 

"I doing great!" Taran said "How about you?"

"Just fine," he said "How did your trip back home turn out?" 

"Oh, it was great" Taran said "I met this really cool Oog-ra that was lost and the two of us had this great adventure. You want to hear about it?" 

"I'm sorry, but I have to get back to work" Arragon said, quite happy that the excuse was legit. He knew that once Taran started talking, he'd never stop. 

"Why don't you stay a while?" he asked, hoping they could catch up on what was going on around the world. It seemed that since Arragon and Harra took over the business, they never got out much after that. Arragon hoped that Taran could confirm some gossip he heard through customers who were speaking too loud and was overheard by the big warrior. 

"I'm sorry" Taran said sadly "I have to leave in a few minutes. The reason why I came here, besides to say 'hi' of course, was to ask you of a favor." 

"Sure, what is it?" Arragon asked curiously. 

"Well, I have this cat with me. And where I'm going, I don't want to bring her along with me. If I did, there might be a chance I can't keep her. So, I was wondering if you could take care of her, just for a week." 

"I can't. Harra wouldn't allow me." 

"Why not?" Taran asked. 

"Harra is allergic to cat hair" Arragon answered. 

"Don't worry. The cat doesn't shed" Taran said, smiling "At least she hasn't shed recently." 

"Well, I still can't. I'm sorry" Arragon said, feeling depressed that he couldn't help. He really wanted to help. 

"Pleeeeease" Taran said emphatically, his eyes wide, trying to look cute. 

"I can't" Arragon insisted. 

"Pleeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaasssssssseeeee" Taran said once again, this time with much more emphasis. 

"Ok. Fine. If you just stop that." 

"You mean saying pleeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaaasssssssssssseee?" 

"Yes" Arragon said, placing his hands over his ears. 

"I'll go get her" Taran said, already on his way out of the tavern "She's outside. I'll be back in a second." 

Taran exited the tavern, leaving Arragon to think out his plan. 

"Ok" Arragon said to himself "I'm going to have to keep this cat out of Harra's sight for about a week. That's shouldn't be so hard. I can leave it in Larras' room since Harra never goes in there. I can feed it when she's asleep."

Taran came back through the door, a small white cat in his arms. He walked up to Arragon and handed him the cat and a small bag of cat food. 

"Thanks Arragon, I really appreciate this" Taran said. He then gently caressed the cat's head and spoke "Don't worry. I'll be back real soon. You just let uncle Arragon take good care of you." 

Taran turned to leave 

"Wait" Arragon said, causing the Flerian to turn back around to face him. 

"Yes, what is it?" Taran asked. 

"What's the kitty's name?" Arragon asked once he had Taran's attention. 

"Oh. Her name is Katelin." 

~~~~~~~~~~

The tavern was now empty. It was way past closing. Arragon was busy wiping the tables with a rag, glad that the tavern was actually closed. He had been on his feet for many hours serving customers, tending back and forth between tables. He sat down in a chair, the legs almost breaking out from under his weight. He breathed a sigh of relief, stretching out his mighty arms. Harra, finished with cleaning the dishes, emerged from the kitchen. 

"Are you finished?" Arragon asked, getting back out of his chair, continuing with his share of cleaning. 

"Yes" Harra said "I'm going to sleep. Goodnight." 

Harra turned towards the stairs and headed for the bed, not even bothering to kiss Arragon goodnight. Arragon was totally unaware that she knew what had happened, he thought she was just tired and wanted to get to sleep as soon as possible. 

"Goodnight, honey" Arragon said, his voice so sweet and endearing, almost making Harra forget about the incident. She continued up the stairs. 

"I'm going to have a word with him when he comes to bed" Harra said to herself, just soft
enough that Arragon wouldn't hear. 

"Good. When she's asleep, I can sneak into Larras's room and feed what's her name.....oh yeah, Katelin" Arragon said to himself, continuing with his cleaning. 

It was very late when Arragon was finished with his cleaning. He took his time, hoping Harra would be asleep when he went up. He slowly walked up the stairs, it creaked loudly under his massive weight, as he headed for the bedroom. 

Once in front of the bedroom, he slowly opened the door, praying that the hinges wouldn't squeak, waking up Harra. 

"I have to see if Harra is asleep so I can feed Katelin," Arragon thought, opening the door very slowly. 

He entered into the bedroom and carefully tipped-toed up to their bed and breathed a sigh of relief, realizing that Harra was sleeping soundly, the slow rising and falling of the sheets giving him a sure sign. Quietly, he tipped-toed his way back out and closed the door behind him. He then proceeded towards Larras' room. 

"Here kitty-kitty" Arragon said, holding out a small tray of cat food. He quickly gazed around the small room for the cat, but couldn't see her. He repeated himself again and this time there was a response. Arragon looked around the small room for the cat, but he couldn't see her.

"Katelin" he said softly, hoping his voice wouldn't wake Harra up "Come out and eat." 

The name seemed to do the trick. Once Arragon called out the cat's name, she responded, coming out of hiding. Slowly, she came forward, towards the big human and the tray of food. She sniffed the food. 

"Go on, eat." 

The cat trusted Arragon and started to eat the food ravenously, finishing the dish within
moments. 

"Boy, aren't you're hungry" Arragon said, reaching his big hand forward to pet Katelin. The cat quickly took a step back, frightened at the sudden movement. 

"I won't hurt you" he said, keeping his hand still. 

Katelin slowly inched back up, her gaze on the hand. She then carefully sniffed it. After a brief moment, Katelin jumped up onto Arragon's hand and ran up the length of his arm, stopping right by his neck. The cat then gently started nibbling on his eat. 


"Hey, that tickles" Arragon said, giggling. He quickly took hold of her and held her in his hands "See. I'm not such a bad guy" he added, holding Katelin near his body to keep her warm. The cat gently purred and then rested her head against Arragon's arm and went to sleep. 

Arragon walked on over to a small sack of hay near the back of the room and gently paced Katelin on it, hoping he wouldn't wake her. The cat never woke, she was fast asleep. 

"You're so cute, Katelin" Arragon said, gently caressing the cat's head, making her purr louder in her sleep. 

Arragon stood up and gazed at Katelin for a few minutes before he turned around and left the room. 

~~~~~~~~~~

"Katelin, where are you?" Arragon said peering into one of the bushes. 

Nothing. No cat. 

"How am I gonna explain this to Taran?" Arragon thought. "He trusted me with his cat and what do I do....I lose her." 

It was an accident, though. Arragon had opened a window in Larras' room to let in a cool breeze of fresh air and Katelin had ran out through the opening. It was strange considering that Arragon had opened the window before and Katelin had never jumped out.

"Tonight's the night Taran gets back, he thought. Damn, I should've never opened that
window." 

"Katelin, where are you?" he said again, checking another bush like many times before. This time, Arragon got lucky. He heard a meow from one of the nearby bushes. Arragon quickly ran over to inspect. He carefully parted the foliage. 

"There she is" Arragon sighed to himself, recognizing Katelin, her coat now looking red against the setting sunlight. He was shocked to realize that Katelin wasn't alone. She was walking along side a black stray cat, a little bit larger than she was, indicating that the cat was a male. At that moment, Arragon realized why she ran out like that. She was in heat. 

"Katelin," Arragon said "Come here." 

The stray quickly ran away, frightened from the big warrior's voice, leaving Katelin alone with Arragon. 

"Come here" Arragon said, extending his hand non-threateningly. 

Katelin immediately realized that it was Arragon and quickly jumped into his hands.

"Thank goodness I didn't lose you" Arragon said, breathing a sigh of relief. He was terrified that he wouldn't find her. Now that she was safe, Arragon felt much better. 

"How am I gonna explain that she's pregnant?" he thought. "I better worry about that when Taran gets back." 

Arragon turned around and headed back towards the tavern, Katelin hidden under the cloak he was wearing.

Harra stared out the window at her husband, watching as he went from bush to bush shouting a name that was inaudible to her since he was so far away from her. From where she was, it sounded like he was calling for his brother. 

"Why would he be calling for Larras?" she said to herself. She was quite perplexed at her husband's recent behavior. For the past seven days, he had came to bed much later than before. Maybe he was avoiding her. Suddenly, Harra realized who he was actually calling for. He was calling for that cheap floozy he was hugging a week ago, Katelin. She had totally forgot about that incident. Now that she remembered, Arragon was in big trouble. She quickly grabbed hold of a skillet, the same skillet used to bash rodents, and headed for the front door to confront her cheating husband. 

"Boy is he gonna get it!" 

~~~~~~~~~~

Arragon was just outside the tavern when he heard a voice from a bush behind him. 

"Arragon" came a voice. 

Quickly, Arragon turned to face towards where the origin of the sound came from. He immediately recognized who it was. It was Taran. 

"Taran!" Arragon said, about to hug the Flerian. He quickly stopped his urge squeeze the air from Taran when he realized that he was carrying a sleeping Katelin under his cloak. 

"How did everything go?" Arragon asked. 

"It went great. I got the chance to meet Scuttle. You remember, my cousin. Well, he and I went all over Saldaea, finding items that people dropped. They can be so careless. You want to see?"

"That's excellent!" Arragon said, chuckling. 
 
Harra was now behind the door, waiting for Arragon to enter back into the tavern so she
could teach him a lesson. She leaned her ear against it to hear what Arragon was saying. 

"How was Katelin?" Taran asked, concerned over his cat. "Did she give you any trouble?" 

"Oh, Katelin was great. I had no problems with her. She followed everything I said. I really liked it when she nibbled on my ear and fell asleep in my arms. You know what, I even got Katelin to eat right out of my hand. She's so cute, I wanted to hold her close to me all day." 

"Did Harra find out about her?" Taran asked, changing the subject. 

"No, she didn't. Thank goodness. She would've killed me if she found out I was hiding Katelin in Larras' room" 

Behind the door, Harra gripped her skillet tightly, her knuckles now turning white. Arragon continued on with his conversation, totally unaware of Harra listening in. 

"Um, I have to tell you something" Arragon said "Something you wouldn't like." 

"What is it?" Taran said, concern in his voice. 

"Well.....I think Katelin's pregnant." 

"What?!?" Taran said, shocked at what he just heard. 

"First off, I take full blame for it. It was all my fault. I was careless. It was an accident. I never meant for it to happen." 

That was enough. Harra was beyond the boiling point. She heard enough. She quickly opened the door and faced the shocked Arragon. She then raised her skillet and..................

Bronze 7 
By Rhea Romero


Kichi  lurked nervously by the tram track, yanking and twisting the chain around her neck like there was no tomorrow.  She didn't feel comfortable in this cavern, with these dirty people and their dirty minds.  There were only a few of them, muttering to each other in shadowed corners and eyeing her speculatively.  The chain, Mugu had said, would keep her safe.  Whatever, Kichi had thought.  She had brought her poison darts.

The people she was supposed to meet here were real late.  She sat down and wrapped her arm around her knees.  Digging her shapr little chin into her chest, she stared quietly down the tunnel with her big red eyes.  Her oily wings flittered in agitation.  What could be taking them?  Kichi felt a little nauseous.  She was not made for this life, just like Mugu had said.  Not that she was made for any other.

Everyone in the cavern, including Kichi, stopped and stared when the bedraggled pair walked silently into the flickering torchlight.  The tall elf spread her hands.  "The cart," she said wearily, "jumped the tracks."  With that she stepped up into the chamber and collapsed dramatically against a wall.  The Hithual looked around, resting his somewhat surprised eyes on Kichi.  

They stared at each other for a second.  It took Kichi a few moments to realize that she must look even odder than the dark and bloodied dwarf.  She stumbled up into a standing position and self-consciously rubbed her close-cropped hair.

"I'da lend you's a hand, but..."  Kichi glanced at the stump of her right arm and shrugged with her good shoulder.  The Hithual nodded and coughed in his companion's direction.  The elf maid jumped and ran over to help her short-legged partner out of the deep tracks. 

"I'm sorry!" she exclaimed.  The Hithual nodded silently to her and turned back to Kichi.  

"I'm Lobb.  This is Inzy.  You're our contact," he said briefly.  

Kichi blinked nervously and fluttered up halfway between Lobb and Inzy's eye level.  "I'm Kichi.  Hiyas.  This izza Brak, a station for trabelers."  Try as she might, she couldn't quite lose her accent.  Then, remembering Mugu's instructions, "Oh yeah.  I needs to see some proofs."

Lobb nodded and pulled out the bronze amulet around his thick neck.  Kichi gazed at it.

"Okees," she said with a small smile.  "Folla me."  She turned and flitted down one of the corridors leading out of Brak, leaning in her unbalanced way.  Inzy and Lobb followed.

The Pet Game
By Frason Dranco

The Wonderful World of Pets (which are still described [inaccurately] as 'fams') has always been a strange one. For a fee, you could have a companion for life. One to help pass the lonely hours. Or in combat to help the more magickally inclined.

However might the Elindalians protest, fams are working their ways more and more into a combative and vengeful role in our society. Fams have been used in the past and still today are used to settle scores and to signify feralism.

Whether this is a throw-back to the old Oog-raian tradition of smashing anything that looks furry whenever their upset, or if this is just a new way of being highly annoying, I won't guess. But the act of fam killing, no matter how yelled out against, still occurs to this day.

Why should you care? If the old stand by of protecting that which is lesser then us doesn't cut it, think of the investment you made. Be you a Secian, a San Elf, up to a Dragon, while your bunny is sitting their dumbfounded he's just as vulnerable as the next.

What can you do? Refer to my last article concerning dealing with those who can't seem to 'get it' ('Them Wacky Peoples') for my view on dealing with them.

Then there is the flip side to this, using fams to hunt. While there are no laws against this (yet), I would recommend against this completely. There is a definite cause and effect relationship between hunting with fams and fams being hunted.

Does this mean they can't be of assistance (especially to the mages in the audience)? Of course not. But remember what your paying for is a *pet* more often then not, not a fifty-ton four legged creature of Death. Think about how it will fare before you tell Fido to go sic the troll.

Finding people with fams is another sour spot. And one that requires alot of thought. Having Fido go off to find your ally(especially when you have the powers to see where they are), can be a great way to save time. Finding enemies with your pet can put it in serious jeopardy. Yet another cause of Fido not coming home that night.

In conclusion, pets can be a useful and helpful addition to your abilities, but one that can go up in a pile of feathers (or fur, scales, or hide) in a flash. As long as you remember what's at stake when you have your fam venture where you dare not, you'll have no worries.

Possession: A Tale of Love, Faith, Courage, and Death
Kyrinne Woodmist


Town square bustled with activity.  A few chaotic san elves whispered secrets, lies, or rumors while several secians discussed important news or spoke of the importance of forgiveness.  Merchants proudly displayed their wares and townspeople bargained; their faces looking disappointed or delighted depending upon their success.  Two hithuals haggled over finely crafted weapons and exceptional armor suitable for the fiercest and strongest warriors.  One penthanian merchant boasted the finest silks and satins while a thin frontacian laid claim to the most precious gems, sparkling diamonds and rubies destined for the most beautiful ladies in Spur.
"Shimmering silks and plush velvets fine enough for the fairest maidens," the penthanian said, his voice as soft and alluring as his fine wares.  "Or perhaps you've a wife you'd like to please?"  He grinned widely at a hithual and held up a bolt of diaphanous white silk embroidered with thread made of pure gold.
"The finest gems, the most precious across the lands," the frontacian jeweler announced.  He peered at Kento with small, beady eyes and handed him a sapphire ring to examine.
"I've seen finer sparklies than dese," Kento smirked.  He took another look at the ring and handed it back to the jeweler who looked rather surprised.
"Perhaps you should see a healer about your eyesight," the frontacian suggested with his mouth twisted into a peculiar smug smile.  "Look at this exquisite necklace, a most elegant creation suitable for the loveliest of ladies."  He raised his eyebrow at Kento as he handed him the necklace.
Kento carefully examined the sapphire and diamond necklace and chuckled softly.  "Youse try to trick da Sparklie king?"
"The Sparklie king?" The jeweler gasped at Kento.
"These gems not worth dat much," Kento nodded.  "Now if youse had some large diamonds for dis price...."
Ambertiger grinned and giggled at Kento. 
The merchant frowned at him, gathered up his goods, and muttered something about secian gem experts beneath his breath.  The fire in his eyes was a fine match for the glittering gem that blazed in his forehead.
"Ya needs to lower your prices," Kento said, nodding his head up and down vigorously.  
Two secians, Demeralda and Kyrinne, tickled Kento and giggled.  Demeralda pulled out her copper chimes and played "The Sparklie King."  Everyone except the jeweler roared with laughter. 
The frontacian smiled thinly and said, "Good day."  Looking a little less confident and a little more irritated, he headed off in the direction of the guild district.
Ambertiger chuckled at Kento and pulled him closer to her.
"I am da Sparklie King!"  Kento yelled, grinning from ear to ear and snuggling with the tender-hearted leuian.

Though the sky was as blue as forget-me-nots and the sunlight as warm as a loving embrace, Kyrinne suddenly felt a chill.  Out of nowhere, a bitter cold wind swept through the square.  She trembled so violently that her velvet shawl slipped from her shoulders making Kento glance at her curiously.  Seeping up from the ground a strange freezing mist appeared and wrapped tendrils of intense cold around her small frame.  She noticed that no one else seemed to mind the chilling mist that grew denser and denser by the minute.  Why did only she shiver?
"What's wrong Kyrinne? Demeralda asked, noticing the puzzled look on her friend's face.  "Are you okay?"
"It's so cold, Deme," Kyrinne replied, shivering so much her teeth were nearly rattling.
"Youse feeling cold?" Kento blinked.
"Don't you feel it?" Kyrinne shuddered.  "The cold mist about our feet...?"
"I don't feel it at all....or see it," Reason said, looking worried.  "Are you okay?"
"I feel so strange..." Kyrinne whimpered, looking oddly pale in the bright square.  "The mist is so cold."
Jazbo, a monitanian Knight, pulled Kyrinne closer to him and set her upon his shoulder in hopes of freeing her from the chilling embrace of the mysterious mist.  Her trembling worried him and it showed on his kind face.  He frowned.
"Perhaps she's having a vision?" Reason suggested.
"Deme had one of those," Kento nodded to the human priestess of Set.
"My thoughts are tangled with shadows of the past," Kyrinne whimpered.  "Strange shadows."  Suddenly she winced, flew up, and hovered about ten feet above the square.  She looked nervous and fidgety as if she expected something very bad to happen.
"Oh dear...," Kento mumbled.  He flew up next to her and held her close.  "Youse stay here wif us."
Much to Kento and Demeralda's relief, she nodded and landed.  The cold mist completely engulfed her, almost smothering her in a frigid blanket of fog.  Shivering uncontrollably, she barely managed to pull her shawl closer about her shoulders before she nearly collapsed into the warm comfort of Demeralda's embrace.  Demeralda cried softly when she felt the rapid beating of Kyrinne's fearful heart and the deathly chill of her tiny hands.  She glanced at Kento worriedly, while she held her dear friend close and spoke gentle words of comfort.  Others searched the busy square and spoke in quiet whispers amongst themselves.  The air was tense with apprehension as they discussed the possibilities.  Was it the ice demon, or perhaps one of the chaos lords amusing himself with an innocent secian?  Or was it related to the attack of the bone worm several weeks ago?
Kyrinne could barely see or hear anything through the dense mist, a vile suffocating fog that reeked of decomposition and decay.  Nearly overwhelmed by the nauseating stench, she suddenly stiffened and shuddered violently when a dark presence filled her mind.  Crackling with impure energy, a small nefarious voice spoke to her in a hushed whisper.  "Remember me...remember well," the evil voice said.  "I am coming for what's owed me."  The presence laughed wickedly and fell strangely silent, leaving behind an eerie stillness in its wake. 
"Something's coming," Kyrinne said, tears welling in her eyes.  "Something terrible."
"What's coming?" asked Kelston, a leuian who had just entered the square.
"I'm dwunk," Michael yelled, staggering in behind Kelston.  The second stage dragon took another long draught from his pitcher of ale and grinned mischievously.  The lord's black scales rippled and gleamed as he sighed with contentment.
"Shhh!  Let her tink," Kento said, glancing at Michael reproachfully and mumbling something about some dragons drinking as much ale as hithuals.
"A dark presence," Kyrinne replied quietly, her eyes full of fear and apprehension.  "It says it's coming for what is owed it...."
"Coming from where?" Reason asked, looking up at the sky.
"Shhh?" Michael asked, looking perturbed.  "Why?"  He belched.
Kyrinne covered her face with her hands and sighed, shaking her head from side to side in confusion.  "Who is this voice, so dark and cold?"
"Shhh!"  Reason glanced at Michael and sighed.  She pulled Michael aside and they spoke in quiet whispers.  Michael growled and looked around the square suspiciously.
"It says to remember it well...,"  Kyrinne said, sighing deeply.  Once again, the obscene voice cackled to her, piercing her flesh like a thousand stinging needles.  She felt the chilling embrace of the fog wrap its clammy fingers around her throat with a grip that grew tighter with each passing second.  
"Try as you may, I will take your love this night," the voice whispered, snickering softly and jabbing at her with each intimidating word.  "I will...."  Fingers squeezed tightly around her neck, sharp nails digging into her flesh.
"Cruel!" Kyrinne cried, gasping for breath when the icy hand suddenly vanished.
"What's happening?" Zuberi asked, glancing at Kyrinne who had turned a ghastly shade of pale.  "Where's Depravato, her bondmate?"
"It speaks to me...," she said in a strange soft whisper.  "It threatens to take my love this night."  She cried softly, blinking away her tears.  Demeralda comforted her and muttered something beneath her breath about how innocents are always the ones to suffer.
"Your love?" Solic asked.  The hithual frowned and put on his armor.
"It won't take him easily," Stanrar said reassuringly as he readied his weapon.  
Khatmandu knelt before Kyrinne, took her hand in his, and pledged his protection.  "Not while I live, lass," he said, smiling softly with encouraging confidence.
"We won't let it!" Reason said, nodding to Kyrinne.  "If it's Evoloch, we shouldn't even worry."
Kento and Khatmandu grinned at Reason.  She winked at them and smiled.  
Kyrinne tried to smile and thank the brave souls gathered around her, but could barely move for the storm that raged inside her body.  She struggled to see through the dense fog that floated around her, to ignore the cruel taunts and promises of death and endless misery, and to repel the evil presence that she knew longed to destroy her soul.
Depravato entered the busy square and tenderly pulled his bondmate Kyrinne into his arms.  She cried softly as he comforted and reassured her, promising that she would come to no harm.  She whispered that her heart was not heavy with fear for herself, but for him.  Before he could reply, he felt a cold and icy embrace.  Without warning, the fog grew colder and thicker, reaching out to everyone in the square with icy tendrils smelling as foul and rank as executioner's square.  Like rotten breath from carrion-covered wintry slopes, the bitter fog chilled everyone to the bone and sent their senses reeling.  The square grew dark as ominous clouds formed a strange sentinel above their heads.
"No...," Kyrinne shrieked, snuggling closer in the protection of her bondmate's embrace.
"It comes," Khatmandu said warily as he prepared himself for whatever battle they faced.
Zuberi growled and searched the area, but found nothing.
"Nothin is gonna brush gainst my leg," Kento growled, pulling Demeralda closer to him.  She held her hands over her nose and mouth, looking a little pale from the foul smell.
"Something's out there," Reason said to Michael who nodded and growled.
"There...," Reason remarked, pointing at something dark moving within the eerie fog.  She wrinkled her nose and wiped the tears from her eyes.  "Geesh, what a stench."
"Maybe the little ones should all fly," Stanrar suggested. 
Sir Jinood, a hithual, entered the fog-filled square on his usual rounds.  Assaulted by the stench, he stopped abruptly and asked, "Der trouble brewin?"  He wrinkled his nose at the ghastly smell.
"Kyrinne is seein visions," Kento replied to Jinood, fidgeting nervously.
A small black figure darted from the fog, swiped an ebony blade at Depravato, and then disappeared from whence it came.  Several onlookers shrieked and readied their weapons, but like Khatmandu and Michael, they found no enemy to attack in the dense fog.  Dozens of runes flew around the square as healing and protective spells were cast.  A blue glow surrounded Depravato's head as his health was restored by Sa through a prayer whispered by his bondmate.
"Who is this dark thing?" Kyrinne shrieked, comforting Depravato and looking very apprehensive.
"Wat coward is hidin out der dat he scared to show himself?" Fuf demanded.  The oog-ra  grumbled, folded his arms across his chest, and looked around the area suspiciously.
"A servant of the Chaos Lords?" Reason suggested.
"It's gonna get it's face smeared into a smudge," Michael growled, glancing at his sharp and deadly claws.
"More than its face," Khatmandu nodded to Michael.
"You let Kyrinne alone!" Reason yelled into the fog.  "She's strong enough to defeat you!"
A cold wind rose from within the dense fog.  With frozen fangs as sharp as a cougar's, it pierced the flesh.  The air became heavy and difficult to breathe as the dark presence sought its coveted prize, a tender soul. 
"Anyone else feel dat?" Kento asked, glancing at the unnatural fog swirling around his ankles.
Feeling the chilling wind rush past them, Reason and Demeralda shivered and nodded at Kento.
"Some assassin...," Depravato said, holding his bondmate protectively in his arms and glaring angrily into the shadows.  "Some assassin or dark power."
A young troll sauntered casually into the busy square, raising a few interested eyebrows.  Reason glanced curiously at the troll, but before she could open her mouth to speak, Darkedge quickly swung his sword.
"Don't attack it!" Reason exclaimed, flailing her arms about wildly and staring at Darkedge.
"Wait!" Khatmandu yelled.
Teldor saw the troll bite Darkedge, growled angrily, and shredded it with his claws until it could barely stand.
"Don't attack da troll," Kento pleaded, sighing in frustration.  He hopped up and down and flailed his arms about in sheer desperation.
Blackbadger slashed at the bleeding troll with his steel sword, knocking its broken body to the ground where it shuddered, took its last of breath of air, and died.
Stanrar sighed and Khatmandu growled.
"Why did youse do dat!" Kento asked in disbelief.
"It attacked first," Michael remarked.
"No, it didn't," Reason replied, glancing at the ale Michael still held in his hand.
"Oh," Michael said with a chagrined smile.  He shrugged and glanced at Darkedge.
"It didn't attack first," Kento sighed.  "It was probably gonna tell us somethin."
"Trolls bear me bad memories," Darkedge explained with his shoulders slightly slumped.  "So I am bad for attacking a normal enemy?"
"An honest mistake," Stanrar said to Darkedge.
"Dat troll was probably de only ting dat could have helped us!" Kento exclaimed, muttering something about too many people killing first and asking questions later.
"Someone go kill Darkedge," Michael teased.
Darkedge raised an eyebrow at Michael and furrowed his brow, mumbling something about trolls always being mean.
"Kyrinne's having visions...," Oceanlily explained to Darkedge.  "I really doubt a normal enemy would be verra normal at time like this."
Out of nowhere, a loud embittered cry was heard throughout the city.  Depravato's head suddenly glowed a dark crimson, a peculiar shade reminiscent of dried pools of blood.  Into the sky above the square he quickly and effortlessly soared, his silver wings a brilliant flash even in the dim light.  He snarled and snapped at the air, eager to find the enemy and crush it.
"Youse otay, Depravato?" Kento yelled.  "Come down here!"
"Come on ye evil," Jinood yelled, his face flush with anger.  "Take me on, not Dep!"
Panting heavily, Depravato furrowed his brow and glanced about the square.  Kyrinne flew up beside him, her frail body shivering in the permeating chill of the fog.  "I am so worried about you," she whispered to him.
"Come out you damnable shade," Depravato cursed, his pale red eyes glowing with anger.  He growled and snapped at the air, relishing the thought of slashing the malicious beast with his sharp claws.
"Show yourself coward!" Zuberi yelled into the fog, his mood foul and black.
"Coward!" Khatmandu yelled, an angry hiss escaping his lips.  "Face me!"
A small black hooded figure darted from the fog, slashed at Khatmandu with a vicious dark blade, and then disappeared into the malignant mist.  An angry red slash on his side wept precious blood while the fog whirled and swirled around the square, cloaking the evil presence in a miasmic veil of white.  Dragons growled and secians shrieked in horror.  Within seconds, Demeralda was comforting Khatmandu, her healing spells restoring his health.
"Khat!" Fuf shrieked, surprised by the sudden attack on the noble leuian.
"Like it could touch that old fogie," Michael chuckled, glancing at Khatmandu and winking at Fuf.
"Vomitous scurrying evil," Jinood muttered, his eyes flashing with anger and impatience.  "Be daring and take us all on."
"I've seen dis happen before," Fuf said, nodding to Khatmandu.  "Same exact ting happened to Bizreel."
Fidgeting restlessly, Kyrinne nervously watched her bondmate stare blankly into the thick fog.  "Red glow," Depravato said softly, recalling a terrible memory.  "The dream..."
"I could never bear to lose you," she whispered quietly in his ear, overwhelmed with worry.  "Promise me you will be careful.  It wants to hurt me through you.  I can feel it...."  She had never felt anything so intensely evil.
"You're near....I am safe," Depravato said gently, pulling her into a reassuring embrace.
She smiled weakly, caressed his gentle face tenderly, and glanced uneasily around the square.  Demeralda and Kento were staring at her, their faces awash with worry.  Suddenly, the wicked voice whispered to her again, sending needles of pain up and down her spine.  "Join me in the house of the dead or many will die this night," the presence hissed.  "I will have what is owed me."  Venomous laughter rang out from somewhere deep within the foul-smelling fog.  "Come to me or many will die," it whispered, snickering softly.  Terrible cries of panic and pain assaulted her ears and hideous visions of disease-ridden corpses flashed before her eyes.  Her face as pale as sun-bleached bones, she trembled and cried softly.
"What's wrong Kyrinne? Demeralda asked, her brow furrowed in concern.  "Is it speaking to you?"
"It will kill us all unless I...," Kyrinne replied, looking very frail.
"Unless what?" Kento asked Kyrinne, glancing at Demeralda.  "Unless youse do what?"
"It waits for me in the house of the dead," Kyrinne sighed wearily.  "I...."
"Don't listen to it," Demeralda shrieked, fidgeted nervously.  "Fight it!"
"It says many will die!" Kyrinne cried, covering her face with her hands.  Before anyone had a chance to blink an eye, she flew west.   
Worried friends quickly followed her as she wandered through the fog searching for the source of the hideous laughter that filled her ears.  Tormented by screeching cries of tortured souls and relentless threats of death and misery, she nearly fainted when the voice cackled at her in the House of the Dead.  She covered her ears with her hands, but it did nothing to stop the dreadful screams or wicked voice.
"This is not the place, you fool!  Go to where the undead are to meet your fate."  An icy hand grasped eagerly at her throat as the tiny voice snickered.  "I will have what is owed me...."  She could hear little over the insane laughter that echoed inside her head.
"It's in the haunted house...," she managed to say at last, barely able to speak for fierce beating of her heart.  "It toys with me."
Kento pulled her close into his arms to comfort her as they followed Depravato who led the search in the haunted house.  As they wandered through the eerily silent rooms, shades and spectres leapt from shadows and attacked and killed several members of the party despite the constant rain of healing runes.  Much to their dismay, they found nothing except loose floor boards in the room where XJS once scribbled his initials upon the wall.
"I tire of  your pathetic chase, you puny mortals.  You will never find me...," the presence snickered to Kyrinne as the floorboards quaked and shivered beneath their feet.  "I will come again when I have more patience.  I promise you.  I will have what is owed me...."
The piercing laughter faded and the pain in her head slowly eased.  Unwilling to give up, they continued to roam the dark and dismal halls until convinced that the evil presence would not show itself.  Later, they stood in groups around the square, some of them talking quietly and wondering what the presence was.  Where had it gone?  Would it return to torment her or someone else?  Some simply went home to their beds while others found it hard to sleep for days, never knowing if and when the presence would return.

***************

Days passed and the memory of the presence slowly started to fade.  As usual, the square was fairly busy with townies and merchants wandering in and out and a few clusters of friends always standing around talking or joking.  Water in the marble fountain sparkled in the bright sunlight and a few soft clouds drifted slowly overhead.  Enjoying the quiet and peaceful morning, flocks of doves and sparrows were perched upon the roofs of some of the buildings that bordered the square.  Some of them slept in the warmth of the sun with their heads tucked beneath their wings, while others preened their feathers or nuzzled their mates.  Clusters of modest wildflowers clung to a few bare patches of soil around the base of the fountain, their sweet scent drifting in the air like the breath of angels.  In the cool and shadowy recesses where marble met the carved flagstone paving, a few hidden frogs were betrayed by their quiet croaking.  Suddenly, the tender peace was disturbed by the frantic beating of wings as dozens of startled birds soared high into the sky above the square.  Within seconds the roofs were vacant, the birds had disappeared, and a strange quiet hung in the air. 
"What's wrong Kyrinne?" Fey asked, startled by the birds and wondering why the secian had suddenly flinched and turned pale.
"You don't think you escaped do you?" a familiar presence asked Kyrinne while ghastly scenes of appalling and grisly deaths unfolded before her.  Terrible apparitions filled with hideous mounds of rotting and stinking corpses flashed before her eyes.  Yearning to suffocate her soul, the dark presence snickered wickedly at her discomfort.  Sickening images and stinging pain weakened her until she could bear no more and collapsed on the ground in a faint.  Demeralda shrieked, held her close in her arms, and whispered to her until she awoke.  Fey fanned her wings and glanced about the square suspiciously.
"What's wrong?" Nessessitas asked, fidgeting nervously and looking bewildered.
"A dark presence speaks in my head," Kyrinne replied softly.  She shuddered, her pale red eyes full of fear.
"What's it say?" Kassandra asked.
"It taunts me," Kyrinne whimpered.  "It says I have not escaped..."  She suddenly shrieked and cried in agony as the evil presence, black as pitch, consumed her body, weaving its tenuous fibers deep into her soul.  Overwhelmed by unbearable pain, she sank deeper and deeper into a dark abyss of helplessness while the presence slowly gained control of her mind.  The strange sadistic laughter rang inside her head like tiny bells playing a prophetic requiem of unimaginable suffering.
"What's been going on!?" Fey asked, looking worriedly at Kyrinne.  The second-stage dragon glanced around the square suspiciously, her amethyst scales shimmering iridescently in the sunlight.
"It hurts...," Kyrinne moaned as she struggled against the presence.  "It hurts so much...."
"It's okay, little one," Kassandra said reassuringly, gently stroking Kyrinne's fine blond hair.  "We're here for you."
"What is it?" Kyrinne sighed.  "Why does it not leave me alone?"
"Show yourself!" Teldor yelled at the unseen demon.  "I promise I'll kill you quick...."  Growls that nearly shook the ground rumbled from the second-stage dragon whose red scales burned with a furious fire that matched the fierceness and intensity of his temper.
Lobos glanced at Teldor and then calmly blew on his coral encrusted incense burner, watching the sweet aromatic smoke enfold Kyrinne in a fragrant embrace.  He blinked and pointed at her, for her eyes suddenly turned a deep black, grew hollow, and then appeared normal again.
"Oh, gods!" Kassandra shrieked.  The leuian gasped and looked closely at Kyrinne.  "She looked just like...just like...."
"A corpse?" Teldor asked.
"A skeleton," Kassandra nodded to Teldor.  "Kyrinne, are you okay?"
Fey spoke soft words of encouragement to Kyrinne, while Lobos continued to blow on the incense burner, sending wisps of fragrant smoke swirling around her frail body.  Kyrinne trembled in sheer misery, her pale red eyes staring helplessly at Fey.
 "It brings death...," Kyrinne whispered, her face ashen and strained.  "I can feel it...."  She shuddered and fell strangely silent.
Fey watched Kyrinne stare mindlessly into the darkness, her eyes unfocused and seemingly empty of life.  She sighed in sheer frustration.  "Kyrinne?"  She nudged her gently, but the secian just stood there motionless.  She glanced worriedly at Teldor who mantled his wings around the small secian, his anger a simmering cauldron of pent-up violence.  He snarled at the shadows and spit.
"Calm down." Kassandra said, glancing at Teldor.  "I suspect it wants you to get angry."  Kassandra nudged Kyrinne gently and looked very apprehensive. "Kyrinne?"
Khatmandu growled softly and looked warily around the square wishing the evil coward hiding in the shadows would show itself.  His mood black as soot, Teldor muttered something beneath his breath about cowards, glanced around, and snarled angrily.
"Teldor!" Kassandra sighed.  "Your anger may only make it stronger."
Lost in a dark and evil abyss, Kyrinne barely flinched when the baleful presence spoke to her.  "Kill them all!  You must!"  Eager to extinguish the light that dwelled within her, it wrapped itself around her soul and squeezed it tight.  Her pale red eyes wild and unfocused, she raised her tiny hand, pointed at Teldor, and shrieked insanely.  A dark bolt crackled and flew fiercely from her finger tips, striking Teldor with great impact and knocking him to the ground.  Healing runes flew through the air, while everyone stared at Kyrinne in disbelief.  Within moments she lost consciousness and fell to the ground unharmed, the victim of Fey's well-intended sleep spell.  Fey glanced worriedly at Teldor and caressed the gentle secian who lay pale and helpless, a pawn of some unseen terror.  Both Teldor and Khatmandu growled in anger at the shadows, looking very impatient and eager to slash the coward who preyed on innocents.  When Kyrinne finally awoke her eyes were wild and unnatural like dark portals into a world of demons.
"Fight whatever it is Kyrinne," Fey said, fidgeting nervously.
Glaring angrily into the shadows, Teldor tenderly mantled his wings around Kyrinne.  
"Is someone messing wif Teldor?" Hydroticus asked, peering into the shadows.
"Let her be...," Khatmandu warned everyone in the square.  "She doesn't know what she's doing."
"Don't hurt her," Fey repeated firmly, fidgeting nervously and peering into the shadows.
A portrait of torment, her face as ashen as a death mask, Kyrinne glanced around the square, her eyes darting back and forth as swiftly as a snake's tongue.  The evil presence dominated her, pulling her soul further and further into the shifting darkness that now permeated her frail body.  Distressed by pleas for healing she could not answer and shocked that she was being used, she could do little but watch in horror as a nightmare unfolded around her.  Her body no longer hers to control, her soul screamed in anguish.  The presence snickered sadistically as the blood inside her veins began to boil.
Minerva entered the square, glanced at Kyrinne, and gasped in alarm.  "What's wrong, Kyrinne?"
"Wrong?" she smiled at Minerva.  "Why do you think something is wrong?"  Her strange sweet smile belied the relentless agony of her imprisoned soul, for her words were not her own.
"I brout yu anudder sparklee," Fuf said, showing Kyrinne a gem he held in his hand.  "But yu got git rid a dat evil presence in yu to hav it."  With his brow furrowed in concern the oog-ra nodded and sighed.
"I've ne'er seen ya angry," Minerva said, looking very closely at Kyrinne.  "You look so angry."
Her eyes hollow and tormented, Kyrinne growled viciously at Minerva and shoved her to the ground.  She took a few steps and soared into the air.  Her body trembling, she slowly raised her hand and let loose a crackling bolt that shot fiercely from her finger tips.  It struck Minerva with incredible impact, knocking her back a few feet.  Shocked, Minerva quickly healed herself.  Her welts and bruises disappeared quickly, but her concern and worry grew in their absence.
"I giv yu sparklee if yu make evil go away," Fuf sniffled, his face pinched with worry. "Yu gotta try hard."  Deeply troubled by her torment, he sighed sadly and stared at her, tears welling in his eyes.
"You think that book you carry can help you?" Kyrinne snickered sarcastically, glancing at the red healer's rune book that Minerva held.
"No," Minerva replied softly, pulling Kyrinne closer to her and kissing her softly on her pallid cheek.  "Tis only a book."
Kyrinne flinched and touched her cheek where Minerva had kissed her.  She shrieked and then stood oddly still, staring strangely at Minerva with vacuous eyes.  "I know not what I'm doing," she suddenly cried, holding her head in her hands and weeping softy.  "I feel as if death has taken over my soul...."
"Show yourself coward!" Teldor yelled into the dark shadows.
"Please help me!" Kyrinne cried, leaning her head on Minerva's shoulder.  Minerva held her close, Fey fanned her wings in nervous agitation, and Teldor grumbled angrily, feeling restless and frustrated.
"What's happening to me?" Kyrinne cried, blinking back her tears and looking utterly confused.  "What is this presence?"
"Isa bad thing, Kyrinne," Minerva explained.  "Ya gotta fight it."
"It's dark and evil...," Kyrinne sighed, still trembling.  Suddenly, one of the figurines she carried bit deeply into her flesh. While onlookers stared at her in puzzlement, she shrieked and dropped all the figurines she was carrying.  She stood there staring fearfully at the them as they lay motionless upon the ground.  Several bystanders picked up the figurines, including Minerva.
"Don't touch the reds one!" Kyrinne warned.  "One of them bit me!" 
"I know you're a coward," Teldor snarled.  "Picking on lil ones."
"Drop da red one Minerva," Fuf pleaded, looking more worried than ever.  Minerva nervously examined the red obsidian figurine and looked curiously at Kyrinne.  Lobos removed a cloudy red one from his leather backpack and glanced at it suspiciously.
"Drop it Minerva!" Kyrinne shrieked.  "It's evil...."
"Drop it please?" Teldor asked, pulling his bondmate into a protective embrace.
"It's okay, Kyrinne," Minerva smiled gently.  "I'll destroy it."  She threw the figurine on the ground, watched it shatter into pieces upon impact, and snuggled with Teldor.
"I'll be back to torment you," the black voice whispered to Kyrinne as it slowly lifted from her body.  "Till they are all dead."  Reeking of death and corruption, the wicked presence cackled and slowly faded from her mind. 
"Do you still feel the presence Kyrinne?" Fey asked as she pulled her close and fanned her wings around her.
"It's left for now, but it's not done with me or us," Kyrinne replied quietly, ready to collapse from exhaustion.  "It promises to return...."
"You're okay now?" Teldor asked Kyrinne.
"I think so," Kyrinne said.  "For now...."  She looked at her hands in disbelief and sighed sadly.
"Sorry bout that sleep spell," Fey said, blushing slightly.  "I didn't know how else to stop you."
"I'm grateful," Kyrinne replied, snuggling with Fey.  "I was afraid what it might make me do."
"Don't worry lil one...," Teldor said, smiling softly at her and glancing around the square.  "We'll protect you."

A Squire's Tale
By Blister Peddlerskan

There was once a young Human Knight venturing along noble road to visit a friend of his.  Along the way, he passed by a young human woman, lying by the road and weeping silently.  The knight dismounted with haste and came to her side.  When he lifted her up he saw she had been beaten almost beyond recognition.  When he asked the woman's name, she told him it was Rose Brightblossom.  The knight was shocked.  He knew Rose Brightblossom, and had loved her from afar for many years, he had considered many times asking her to be his bride.  Her beauty had been well-known throughout Spur.  But, now it was gone, stolen by the evil trolls who resented beauty in its purest form.
           
 The Knight took the young woman in his arms and prayed to Rinanni to restore Rose's beauty, promising to marry the woman and protect her for the rest of his days if she would grant this one wish.  Rinanni answered the knight's prayers, appearing before him as a glowing dove.
              
"I will restore her beauty," Rinanni told the knight, "but I will leave it up to you to decide whether you wish her beauty to return during the hours of day, when others might see her, or during the hours of night, when you will alone be by her side."
               
The Knight was unsure which of Rinanni's offers he should accept.  Certainly he would desire her beauty as she lay by his side, but then again he couldn't force her to show her hideously scarred face as he presented her as his wife during daylight hours.
                
In the end, he could not decide.  He wasn't even sure it was his decision to make.  And that is what he told Rinanni.  "Rinanni," he said "I can not decide the woman's fate for her.  I leave the decision up to her, and will stand by my offer of marriage whatever she decides."
                 
The glowing dove shone brighter and seemed to radiate eternal warmth and happiness.  "I am proud of you, knight," she beamed, "You have chosen correctly.  It is not up to you to decide another's fate, but to allow her to make her own choices in life.  As a reward she will have her beauty restored....both night and day."

The dove transformed into a beautiful maiden who then kneeled down and placed a warm hand on the girl's cheeks.  Her body glowed briefly, and she blinked and all her wounds were gone and she was just as beautiful as ever, if not more.  Soon after, they got married in Rinanni's temple and lived happily ever after.  

The young knight came to be a respected and noble High Lord and owned many lands in his own manor.  Rose became a healer of Rinanni and opened up a school for clerics with her husband.

An Oog-ra Story
By Dagoon Bloodfang


This is story that my mum told me. It is one of my favorites.

Once upon a time, in a village not far from here, there lived a young Oog-ra.  He was a big fellow, with arms the size of tree trunks, and a skull plate strong enough to shatter rocks.  He was big, strong and some even say, wise.  He was clever, and made a club with a sharp rock in it that could really hurt, but he never used it on his friends and family.  He put a knife on the end of a long stick, and was able to throw it really far.  He was very well liked, and everyone wanted to be like him.

One day, he was out wondering around the hills and fields, when he came upon two grate dragons. They were sitting in the field starring at one another very hard.  He knew they were dragons because they were bigger then anything he had ever seen before.  He sat and watched them for a few minutes.  They didn't move, they didn't even blink. They just sat there staring at each other.  Between them was the prettiest rock the young Oog-ra had ever seen. It shined and sparkled in the sun, and as he watched, he felt himself drawn to the rock.  Walking slowly so as not to disturb the two dragons, he moved to the rock and looked deeply into it.  He watched as the light played off the dragons and shine back at him, and with a trembling hand he reached out to touch it.

Then the dragons ate him.

You sure you should have that?", a voice asked in the night.

No one answered.

"I asked if you should have that . . . " the same voice asked.

"Quiet you!", another voice whispered after a pause.

"But dad.. I was just y'know.. asking..."

"Shut up!", the father whispered back to him.

The child nodded in the darkness, and crawling further down the passage. The father could see the broadsword gleaming in the distance.

His father smiled,". . . Look at that son". His son cleared the sewage off his face, blanched, and looked down the passage. A bright light shone in the distance.

"Should I get it?", the child asked him quietly. His father looked at him, and nodded.

"I'll back out of here, while you go in and get it", his father finally decided. His child crawled through the small sewer, while he backed out slowly.

"Hurry and get it, Shad!"

Shaderick finally got to a room full of treasures and weapons... including the Demantoid Broadsword which hung from the ceiling. This room wasn't like all the rest of the poor quarter. It was illuminated by tiny magick flames in each corner, and one on the ceiling. The walls were all draped in velvet, while the ceiling was pure marble. Treasure surrounded him, and the inscription of rare runes crowded the walls.

Shaderick stared in awe. He quickly walked over to the broadsword. He was ready to pull it out, when he heard shouts from the entrance of the sewer passage. He ran to the opening of the sewer, and peered through it, hearing his father scream: Castovio. 

Outside stood 4 guards, each of them carrying one limb of his father... disconnected from his body. On the ground lay his fathers torso, bleeding from the arms and legs. Tears forced through his eyes, his nose and eyes swelled up, and rage filled his heart. He took the sword from it's holder, and charged through the sewage pipe.

The guards looked surprised, but this was their job, so they were ready for it. Shaderick glanced down at his father's corpse, and wielded the blade. It started glowing fiery red, and it sealed itself to Shad's hands.

The guards, confused, drew their blades anyway. Shad growled, and started swinging unskillfully. But oddly enough each swing connected, and the guards all fell to the ground, without their life. Shad looked at his fallen opponents, and back to his father, and the blade grew dim once more. He looked around with surprise on his face, as if he forgot what just happened. He quickly stored the blade, and walked back to his home.

He stepped up to his door, the house was in the Poor quarter, a small shack near the Anything Goes Club. He reached forward to put his hand onto the knob, but dropped to the ground in pain, instead. His eyes beclouding, he reached down towards the sword, it was glowing that same red color again, this time, the 'power' looked as though it were going back into the hilt, instead of out like last time.

He dropped the sword behind a pile of trash near his house, and opened his door. Right as he opened the door, two knights stood charged out from his house, knocking him unconscious.

Shaderick looked around, his eyes still white from the onrush of morning's first entrance into his body. His head swirled around to see the face of a Frontacian Justice. The justice's cold, white eyes peering into his own. He jumped back, and snarled, not knowing where he was, or what happened, he couldn't trust anyone. The justice glared at him coldly, "You realize you have just committed a very serious crime".

"W. . . what?", he asked the Justice.

"That blade didn't belong to you, it didn't belong to scum like you. . ."

"How dare you!", Shaderick growled and slowly started standing up.

The justice pushed him back down, "Oh, would you like to try? You do remember you threw away the sword, and we have crews looking for it right now. I figured it would be great to have you decapitated by it . . . seems fitting doesn't it?"

Shaderick bumbled to get back up, and swung his fist at the justice, "DIE!". The Frontacian quickly threw some runes at the human entrapping him in a Web of Ice. 

"How stupid are you?", the justice growled. Shad just glared back at him. "To think you could kill me? You need some teaching, I'll send you there...", he smirked, and tossed a translocation spell at the young boy.

The boy's body slowly twisted and swirled into a created white vortex above him. Shad's limp body reappeared in a dark and foggy forest, above a black vortex. He slowly regained his senses, and stood up. He shot his gaze across the forest, only to see more and more of the purple mist that rose from the ground slowly . . .

'Where the hell did you put him?", the stout Mayor demanded. The justice jumped back, and dug through his brain for the appropriate words. Things were very hard to say around the mayor, he was a demanding man, and an amazing mage. His eyebrows curved upwards inside of down, and his eyes burned fiery red.

"I . . erm . . . I sent him to your forest.. so he could..", the justice barely got out.

"So he could die? You idiot! We NEED him for that broadsword, otherwise, we won't find it."

"We combed his house, and the surrounding areas, it's not there. We aren't going to find it even if he knew where it is."

"How does that make sense? It's obviously not there, he hid it."

"Our guards reported it being around his house, you ign..."

"What were you going to say?", the justice looked at the ground, "Never mind then, I'll punish you later.. when the time is more convenient for me. And about the guards, Who cares what they say? Four of them were defeated by one child!"

"With the blade... sir..", the justice followed up.

"Blade Schmade, he's still a kid," the dark skinned mayor snorted.

"You said the blade was magickal . . so why not?", the justice asked, confident he would stump the mayor this time.

"No Magickal blade will help you hit better. Not even I could do that."

"If your so powerful, create another blade yourself, oh great mayor", the justice rolled his eyes.

The Mayor chuckled and said, "You stretch my patience. But nonetheless, I'll explain why..."

The mayor started speaking more quietly now, as if he didn't want people to hear him. "It all started about 250 years ago. Around the time when second stage dragon's started showing up in our city. Now, as you know, Frontacians like myself can create magickal weapons of mass destruction. If you've ever seen one of these weapons used in combat... you'd be dead. Frontacians didn't obtain this ability easily, it took awhile of living for them to accomplish this great task. One Frontacian by the name of Enkidus, learned to make weapons that did more then attack when swung. The bearer could control them with his mind, instead of with their arms. He was a weak man, so this suited him well. He made these weapons more powerful then anyone mage can do with his runespells. They were known throughout the world as "Blades of Spur". Which would explain why I am so rich..", the mage chuckled to himself and continued, "by this time, the Frontacian had worked up a great reputation among all Spurians. Dragons, at this point in their life, were active among the community, and known for their combat skills in games held by Arenamasters. So, of course, dragons knew about him."

The Justice let out a silent sigh, because he had no idea where this story was getting to. The mayor, however, continued, "A Dragon by the name of Bizriel approached the mage one day, and asked him to build a fine broadsword, so he could use it to teach the young of his race how to use weapons. First stage dragon's couldn't use their claws yet..."

"Do ya think?", the justice snorted.

The mayor growled, but kept telling his story, "The Frontacian looked surprised, and asked him why he picked him. Bizriel told him that he was the best, and he needed the best, since dragon's weren't very good with their weapons.. The Frontacian agreed, and set to work crafting the finest blade ever to be built.  It took several years, but Bizriel waited, knowing that a dragon's lifetime was long, and he could help the young in other ways without the blade, primarily magicks, something he excelled in. 17 years had passed, 150 new dragon's were born Each of them needing help, so he had lots of work to do with this blade. He told the mage he would need more, but faster this time. The mage raised his eyebrow, and asked him how many he would need. Bizriel smiled and said, as much as you can do.."

The justice looked a bit more interested now, for, it was one of his race that was completing this amazing act. The mayor could see his pride too, and continued, "You see, once you make one weapon, the others aren't so hard. So Enkidus set to work. But, with each blade, his forging power became weaker, and with that, so did the blades. Soon enough, he had found out his power was drained. After 149 blades, he had no power in his body to create more, and he went into severe depression. Bizriel didn't mind much, he was only using Enkidus so he could wage war upon the Arachnians. Enkidus, finally lost the will to live, and took the weakest of the blades, and plunged it through his heart, sealing his life into it... Bizriel found his dead body, and cursed himself for not helping the poor Frontacian out, so he could obtain more swords. But, he would know the city would blame him for the death, so he had to stage it as a murder, ,and who better to be set up then the Matriarch of the Spurian spider's. Late that night, Bizriel snuck into the webbed halls of the Matriarch's home. He took the blade that killed the Frontacian, and stabbed it into the sleeping spider, killing her instantaneously. Bizriel chuckled, and walked through the gloomy halls, back out into the marshy paths in the Eastlands. He trudged across the Gnome Village, and finally took flight, with the golden spider roped onto his back. He grumbled, and swooped down onto Enkidus's house, which was only a few miles away, near the gremlins hideout. He quickly drew some blood with the same sword that was used to kill both Spurians, and dashed it upon the Matriarch's mandibles. Creating the illusion that the golden spider was in fact, the killer of Enkidus. He then cast a flame spell on the spider, to make it look like Enkidus fought back, because everyone knew he would."

The Frontie justice grumbled.

"Anyway, he knew that he would have to do a little more, so he took the swords, and magickally altered their color, to make them look different. He  then hid them away in his lair, except the weakest one, which he had also not painted. It was covered in blood, so that was good enough. He sheathed it behind a wing, and slept at his lair for the night, which was unusual for him, he liked sleeping above ground, but tonight he felt safer under. The next morning, he awoke above ground, almost frightened, but more curious. He knew someone had done this, but he'd find out later, after he checked the word on the street about the two . . . murders."

"The bas. . .", the justice started, but his words were cut short by the mayor's story, and his rude behavior.

"Bizriel strolled into town square, he asked another dragon what had happened in Townsquare, seeing the worried faces, and all. The dragon told him there was one murder, and that a few people were all cut up when they awoke.. Bizriel thought to himself... '1? and where's my sword...'  The other dragon's, however, heard this. They questioned him, but he didn't answer, however, he did notice a few dragon's telling him to check his back, for cuts like the other Spurians had gotten. He had 7 distinctly patterned cuts on his right shoulder. A small 5 sided star enclosed in a larger circle, with a tiny circle outside of it. Bizriel murmured a curse, and set off for the newsstand. He picked up a  paper, and read the headline: "Issabelll Found Dead In Missing Frontacian's house! He looked up shocked, and threw the paper down. He set off for his lair, which was being magickally protected, by a barrier. He looked around for someone, but no one was there. He finally figured to just blast it open, which succeeded. He entered his lair through the silvery portal which was constructed by an intelligent first stage dragon.. who wasn't as lazy as Bizriel. He looked in his treasure room, everything was intact, including all the swords, except the bloody murder sword It contained the small symbol on Bizriel's back, as on his hilt. Bizriel quickly translocated himself back to spur, He asked a local peddler who had been attacked by  the "Night stalker", as people referred to him as. The peddler, being a drag-al, knew everything about it, from chatting with certain females. He quickly sought out these individuals, and killed them. One he wasn't so sure about, it was a young man, who had just given birth to his first son. He was a very poor man, so one has to wonder why he was the victim. Anyway, the son's name was Shaderick, the first in the line of six Shadericks in Spur. The last, was that boy you just sent to my forest, the sword, was the murder sword from the past. The frontacian... is me. I need to talk to this boy, get the sword back, tell him why I hurt his great great great great grandfather, and kill that blasted dragon!"

The justice gasped in awe. Everything fit together so clearly now, and he had wondered why he sent the boy to the forest . . . and regretted in doing so. "I thought your name was Izli, sire. . . ?"

Enkidus squinted at him and said something completely irrelevant to his question, "Your going to have to retrieve that child for me, you know?". The justice murmured a curse, and went towards the door.

"Excuse me, Shaderick, be well.", The mayor winked.

Shaderick nodded, and opened the door, he turned back to Enkidus, and said, "Sir.. I ask for 10 guards to assist me in finding my grandchild."

"I knew you would come to your senses, and I'm sorry for the hereditary scar, the only one I knew how to create.", Enkidus bowed, the first time Shaderick had seen him do as such. 

. . . The younger Shaderick clung to the branch of a tree had had climbed. He knew he'd have to make it on his own. He thought to himself, 'This sure would be a lot easier with the broadsword'. He mumbled, and swung down the tree, the fear in his heart still there, but his courage roared through it. He darted forward into the purple mist, not knowing what was ahead of him, nor caring. He was a quick runner, so he did not fear being caught. He could see things as they came close, so he knew when to duck, jump and turn. The only thing he feared was running dead on into a dead body, one of the undead. This oddly enough, happened. A zombie stood in his way, towering 3 feet above him. The icy gaze of this dead, but not so dead creature sent a chill down his spine. He looked in his pouch for his dagger, but it was missing. He flailed his arms, and started running the opposite direction, only to be cut off by the most powerful of the undead, the Greater Wight. He started to weep, and chant prayers he had only heard his father use in times of great need, luckily, they were answered.

Sa appeared before the young Shaderick, and asked him what he needed. Shaderick shrieked, "A chance!". Sa looked confused, and looked around. There he saw the two undead.

"Usually, I don't help people like this, but you are worthy, and I see potential in you as one of my priests, even though your family reeks of thief. Nonetheless, I'll hand you a blade, the last one you touched. It looked nice enough to do some damage. Heh. Well, have fun.", Sa chuckled at his own little joke, and as promised, the Demantoid Broadsword of Enkidus appeared before him. Shaderick quickly wielded it, and the glow became visible again. He grinned evilly, and swung, unskillfully, but as before, each hit connected. The undead quickly perished, again, and he set off in the same direction.

Grandpa Shaderick was rounding up his guards, and heading for the forest. It was located just north of the Governor's mansion, where the Mayor resided. The older Shaderick hastily entered the gate, where the mist grew. He touched a large panel on the gate's base, and the mist disappeared. Through the trees, he could see his grandchild, fallen from the swords backlash. He smiled slightly, and rushed to save him.

"Shaderick..?", the older Shaderick asked, more as a greeting, then a question.

Young Shaderick's eyes were clouded, and he looked up at his grandfather, unknowing of who it was. He rolled over onto his back, slowly, and asked where he was, "Where . . . am I? And wh . . .you're the justice . . you . . .". The older Shaderick frowned, and picked him up to carry him to his small house just off of Noble way.

The forest was near the old haunted house, where adventurers sometimes ventured, in search of old treasures and practice. He circled around the Haunted House, and finally made his way to the front gate. There, he spotted two shades, waiting to sink their frozen claws into the two Frontacian's flesh. The older Shaderick cursed, and picked up the boy's sword, only to have it glow bright pink, and jar itself lose from the holder. A huge green ball, translucent in appearance, solid as a rock in touching.  It quickly started to separate into many other balls, tiny as the pupil of a small Secian. They burned fiery red now, and bounced of each other excitedly, until one of them burst. The older Shaderick shielded his eyes, while the two shades that were in awe by this performance, vaporized. The Shadericks, however, stayed intact, the eldest quickly picked his son, and the treasure, up and darted away. For he knew guards would be there to investigate soon, and feared being caught.

Once in his home, a large two story building made up of magickal ice in a gate off of noble way, he put his grandchild in a small iced bed. He put the sword back into his grandson's hand, and he awoke promptly. He sat up in bed, and sipped the soup his grandfather had made for him. "Look, grandson..", the elder of the two started.

"What? I have no grandfather, my father told me he perished long ago. So don't lay claim to what isn't yours!", Shaderick yelled to his assumed grandfather.

"I am your father's father, making you my grandson, look Shaderick, look at my shoulder.", Grandpa Shaderick removed his Archaic Robes, revealing a large scar on his shoulder, faded, but intact, it was a five sided star with a circle enclosing it, and another tiny one outside of it. His grandson pulled up his sleeve, showing the grandfather the same scar, only lighter.

"You are my grandfather . . .", both Shaderick's smiled and embraced in a hug.

"But, about the name, we'll need to change one of ours.. and since I'm the eldest..", Granfather paused.

"Then you should have your original name.", The younger smiled.

"Nay, let you have the original, you'll last longer in the world, I'll change mine to Craon, named after the brother of Enkidus," Craon smiled.

"That came.. rather easily, Grandfather . . ." Shaderick remarked.

"That's a whole different story, Shad m'boy, and I'll get to it later, but right now, we have to get some sleep, we have a long day ahead of us . . . we need to find those other swords, and Bizriel."

 Craon awoke to a cool morning breeze, he stood up slowly, and stretch his arms wide. He heard a stirring in the kitchen. Fear took over his body, and he quickly got a runespell in his mind, to be able to cast on reflex. He slowly drug his unwilling body into the kitchen.

"STOP!", someone shouted out. Craon jumped back with fear, and let loose his spell, it bounced off the marble table and shattered a few bronze pots and pans.

"DIE!" Craon shouted back; Shaderick was on the floor . . . laughing.

"You sure are careful, ya old coot!" Shaderick remained laughing.

"You little rascal! What are you doing up so early?" Craon said as he, too, started laughing.

"Father always made me get up this early, I had to cook breakfast everyday, I made us Yelicakes. Scrumptious!", Shaderick smiled.

"Look good, I haven't had a real meal in ages, always ate that prison food, I guess the prison and Yelicans are related, being so close together and all.", they both smiled, and sat down to eat and converse.

"So . . . what happened to your fath . . . my son . . . ?", Craon finally asked.

"He died," Shaderick replied smally.

"That's it? He just up and died? I highly doubt that, we have always been such a healthy family, disease wasn't something that carried throughout our blood," Craon pointed out.

Shaderick started telling him of the night he and his father had found the broadsword, ". . . And I couldn't go back . . . because he was dead, and I didn't want to see him, but I knew I couldn't help him, so I went back to the house, to sleep for the night, but then I was knocked unconscious by your guards." Craon nodded, and turned his head towards the window, peering out into the morning blue sky.

"We have to kill that Dragon," Craon stated, shocking Shaderick.

"Why?  He didn't do it.  Enkidus did!" Shaderick announced.

"How did you know that?" Craon demanded.

"I heard everything that was said when you and Enkidus were talking in the throne room, while I had been running for dear life in the forest, he must have left a magickal speaker on . . ."

"So what? It was a Frontacian that was hurt, not the dragon, and it was the dragon's fault, not the frontacians, we need to kill that Sapphire.", Craon sighed, "Enkidus will have my head otherwise . . ."

Shaderick grumbled, "If Enkidus isn't alive, how will he take your head?"

It finally dawned on Craon, he got a few runespells ready, and had Shaderick wield the sword, they marched silently towards the mayor's gates. Courage and Bravery were the only things in their mind, no fear, no pain, just the feeling they would succeed.

At the mayor's gate, Shaderick swung his blade at the gate, shattering it into small pieces of glass, of which it was made out of. Not a very sturdy gate. Craon marched in Enkidus chambers, and threw a runespell onto his bed, charring it, and leaving Enkidus unharmed.  Enkidus rolled onto the ground, and shouted a curse. "What do you think your doing you idiot!?"

"You've always been the best at everything," he grunted and threw a ring of fire behind Enkidus, who was pushed forward, "You've always been the richest," he grunted again, and threw another ring on the left of Enkidus, "You've always been most powerful," he threw another ring of fire on the right side of Enkidus, "You were always the best . . ." He threw one more ring of fire in front of Enkidus. "Now what, brother! What can you do?! You can't do anything! I'm better at this, I always was, you can't do anything! I have you where I want you! And now I'm going to kill you!" Craon flew into the air his arms behind him, he threw his arms forward, shouted an incantation. A Glowing Wall of Fire started to form at his fingertips, and Enkidus started screaming.

"Don't! BROTHER! NO!" Enkidus screamed as the runes from Craon's fingertips slowly formed into a flaming wall, it shot out of his hand, and singed the back wall of the room. Enkidus ring remained, plastered to a melted glass vase.

Shaderick bowed his head solemnly; his great uncle had just perished. Craon wiped the sweat from his brow, and panted. "It's . . . over . . ."

"What about the dragon, grandpa?", Shaderick asked.

"I could never take him . . . alone.", Craon frowned.

"I can help, my sword can help!" Shaderick beamed.

Craon smiled, and nodded, "Tomorrow then, we'll round up some cleric's, and kill Bizriel."

Dawn broke early, not a good sign for an attack. Craon slowly woke, and rose to a cloudy morning. He put on his Archaic Sapphire Robes, again, and set out for breakfast in the Yelican forest. Craon knew about the martial arts, and was good with them. He killed a few yelicans, quickly, and skinned the meat off them with a small dagger. He walked back towards his home, and greeted his grandson, as he was stretching. "You cooking today, son?"

"I'm the only one that can," Shaderick winked and smiled. He threw the meat into a pot, and some herbs and spices. Shaderick was an excellent cook, not a heredity thing. There was a silence in the room, and they both knew why. 

"We're talking to some clerics today, right?" Shaderick slowly said.

"Yup, we sure are. ." Craon said distantly. "Did I ever tell you why we have these scars?"

"I figured it out on my own."

"Tell me what you think, then, boy." Craon listened to his own words, seeming snippy.

"Well, you were his brother, and, he cut you, but if you were his brother . . . why are you still around?"

"I'm not your grandfather, Shaderick."

"You aren't?"

"No, I'm your great great great great Grandfather, the first in a line of Shaderick's. I changed my name to Shaderick, after the... deaths, so that Bizriel wouldn't kill me."

"So, I was related to Enkidus?"

"Yes, his great great great great nephew. We lived a long time, because of a few soul dealings with Sa. I wanted to kill Bizriel and Enkidus before I died, and here's my chance. I got one, now we'll get the other," Craon snickered.

"Is my real name Shaderick?" Shaderick asked.

"Yes, of course, you were named that at birth."

"My father said something before he died . . . Castovio."

Craon jumped back, like he had seen a ghost. He eyed Shaderick carefully. "The name of the blade, boy".

" . . . What?"

"The name of the bloody blade is Castovio, meaning weakest in our tongue. Prophecy fortells you are to be the last of the Shaderick's...your scar, it's almost gone... You are the last, therefore the weakest. Not weakest in heart, not strength, but in blood. You carry the our symbol the weakest. Castovio is you, which is why the blade only accepts you as it's one true wielder. As long as that blade stays connected to you, then you are immortal, like Bizriel. It prevents old age death, only, if Bizriel was to say . . . scratch you," he chuckled, "you'd die."

"I'm not weak!" Shaderick yelled in defense.

"I didn't mean it that way . . .", Craon frowned.

"Let's just kill the wyrm, and get done with it, where are these clerics?" Shaderick mumbled.

Craon nodded, and got ready for the fight. He put some special alchemic potions into his bag, got a few spells ready for counter-actions, and made sure Shaderick had his blade. They set off for Town Square.

"Alright, we need volunteers, high skilled only, were going to kill a wyrm!" Shaderick shouted throughout town square.

Shouts ran through the city, and many people applied for the job. As they were narrowing out the applicants, a shadow was cast on the citizens.  "You wanted to see me, Craon?"

"It's been a long time, dark one."

"Perhaps too long."

"Enough with the chit-chat, I want a duel, two of my cleric's, my boy, and me, versus you, and one pick in the crowd." Craon glared at him.

"How about me versus you?", Bizriel smiled from the corner of his mouth.

"You know you are too po . . . Yessss . . . me and you . . .", Craon was startled by his own words.

"Hm, change of heart from the cowardly drainer I knew before. Maybe this will prove interesting." Bizriel cackled, his sapphire scales shaking and glaring into the eyes of everyone on the ground.

"A few rules, to make it a little more even . . . wyrm . . . first off, no flying, secondly, you keep your breath to yourself. And no healing. Deal?"

"Cakewalk," Bizriel snorted.

Shaderick looked on carefully. "Tell us when to begin, son," Craon nodded to his kin.

"BEGIN!" Shaderick shouted, catching Bizriel off guard.

Craon struck first, with an amazing spell, sending Bizriel to the ground, gasping. The sapphire Dragon was overconfident. The large dragon stood up, and bit at the Frontacian. But all he came up with was wood splinters in his mouth, because while Bizriel was getting up(He is a very large dragon), Craon managed to put up a wall of wood.

"Gonna have to do better then that, Sapphire!" Craon yelled.

Bizriel roared, and began casting a dark spell. Strands of red appeared before him, and Craon cursed. Instead of Craon protecting himself, he concentrated on the spell heading his way. To his luck, and skill, the spell broke it's strength, and dissipated. Bizriel cursed, and clawed again, still hitting more wood.

"Let's see you do something worth my while, old friend," Bizriel chuckled.

"Not taking me seriously yet, wyrm?"

"Nor will I ever," he smirked.

"Then watch this, dragon."  Craon threw another runespell in the path of Bizriel. It glowed for a minute, then disintegrated.  Bizriel chuckled.

"Knew that one, try another."

"Hmm . . . " Craon tried to hide his anger, and show that he wasn't afraid. A bad feeling set in his stomach, he licked his lips, and flew his hands into the air. "DIE DRAGON!"

Runes whipped from Craon's hands. The gems on his palms lit up with fury, and the gem on his head glowed an eerie purple, which illuminated the now dark city. The glare of his palms broke the dragon's concentration, and he winced his eyes. He roared as the spell from Craon scratched across his face, scarring him for life, if he was to live through this battle. Bizriel growled, and his sapphire scales rippled as the power of his runes jumped into his hands.

"Blast it!", Craon shouted out. He put his hands up in surrender, but Bizriel carried on. The spell hit Craon with force, knocking him back to the ground, growling with rage. The feeling of helplessness took over his body, while rage pushed him forward. Constantly being knocked down, claw after claw. Penetrating his silvery colored diamond mail. Craon gasped for air, as a claw raised up for the final blow. Shaderick set his foot in place, and dashed at the dragon with the sword readied. Bizriel's claw swept down fiercely, shattering the armor of the now deceased Frontacian. Blood spurted across the battlefield. Bizriel turned around just as the sword plunged into his stomach. It glowed, bright orange, and the blood on it seeped slowly through the dragon's body. His body now translucent, glowed the same bright orange. The blood shot straight back into the sword, exploding the hilt into Shaderick's hand.

"AGGGGHHH!", Shaderick screamed as his hands burned from the magickal force of the blade. His gems on his hand had also been destroyed, rendering his runes unusable. Bizriel laughed coldly, and clawed at him toyingly. Shaderick's emotions ran high, his adrenaline took over his body, and he screamed fiercely. His fists lit up, and he charged at Bizriel. "You killed him you worm!"  Bizriel smirked, and clawed at his face, blood gushing out fiercely. He let out a cry, praying to his god for sanctuary.  Sa appeared before him once more. Bizriel swung his claws at the back of Sa's neck. They were reflected back, sending the sapphire Dragon backwards, onto his rear. Sa turned around and glared coldly at Bizriel.

"Are you stupid, Drake?" Sa laughed.

"This isn't between me and you, it's between me and him.", Bizriel growled quietly through his teeth.

"Well, it looks like I'm just going to help out."

"I'm warning you...", Bizriel stated confidently.

"Of what? You can't make me leave!" Sa smirked.

"Yes, I can," Bizriel launched a translocation aura from his hands, sending Sa to whatever plane he had been thinking of at the moment, and quickly turned his attention back to Shaderick. "Good night, Shaderick." With that, Bizriel sent his teeth deep into Shaderick's skull, piercing through the skin, bone, and brain, sending his spirit to another land.

Bizriel fell to the ground with blood loss, and tried to heal himself. It wasn't working. He gasped as he felt his life try to slip away, and a cold chill ran through his body. Just as the last of it felt it was gone, a warm breeze blew over him. His eyes shot open, staring right into a pair of ruby eyes. "Weldo . . .", speaking took away the last of his strength, and he slipped into unconsciousness.

Bizriel awoke later, the Secian was pouring more medicine into his mouth. "It's good to have a sage as a bondmate . . ." he smiled warmly.

"Welp, anyone could have done this," Weldoian giggled.

"Still, you were there," he grinned, and sat up. "We'll be back in Spur soon enough, so we won't have to stay in this place."

"We'll see."  Weldoian grinned, and they left to watch the sunrise on the rock near his lair in Asma.
