Dear Readers,

Surprise!  The DFC offices, contrary to popular belief, have NOT been ransacked, imploded, or burned to the ground, and yours truly is still alive and well.  After a hiatus of roughly three months, entailing too many setbacks and complications to mention, we're back in business.  Hopefully, with the start of the new year, the DFC will experience a rebirth of sorts.  Things have been lagging lately, but if all goes as planned, that will change soon as well.  I have made it something of a resolution to get this publication back on its feet, and thus, naturally, the suggestions of our contributors and readers are vital.  Let me know what you would like to see from the DFC in the future; this is, after all, your paper, as much as it is mine.  That's not to say I'll LISTEN, mind you.  Err, ahem.  Just a little Drag-al humor, of course.  In all seriousness, it is my intention to restore this paper to its former . . . glory?  Well, close enough!  

Until next month--and it really will be next month this time, I promise.


Marigold Lyrian

Sagely Wonderings, pt. 4
By Weldoian Sesca-Oskaloq


"Onlig . . . .thou hast done well in thy quest to please me!  And, though thou hast died in a dishonorable way, thou hast deserved the pleasentries and holy gifts of a Hero.  These are . . . ." said a divine voice from above.

Onlig waited for the voice to finish, but instead, felt himself float back down in the miserably cold cave, and into his body, where he came to with a jolt and looked around.  He didn't feel any pain, but he couldn't decide whether it was because he was numb, or because it was too painful to feel.  He looked at Triam across the way, and frowned when he saw Triam was still out cold.  He heard a rush of waves swept into the cave, and he feared he would go unconscious again.  But as the waves came to swallow him up in their unearthly chilling jaws, something, a forcefield of sorts, appeared, as if by magick (which it probably was), and the waves crashed into it, barely managing to push the field backwards a few centimeters.  He stared at awe at the disappearing forcefield, and turned his head to a soft giggling he heard from the back of the cave.  He saw a young Frontacian girl standing there, watching him.  He got up, and sprang for the girl, not knowing who she was or what she was doing there in the cave.  He began to swing his claws, but was stopped by a similar forcefield that had stopped the waves, only smaller.

"Who are you?" growled Onlig.

"Calm down, Mr. Khitty Man!  I'm Aristhma!  Triam's friend." said the girl.

"You know Triam?" asked Onlig.

"Yeah!  I took care of him.  And my Father took care of you . . . until he found what you were carrying." said Aristhma.

"Why did he throw us in here?" asked Onlig.

Aristhma shrugged.

"He said something about Nalnoia." she said.

"Nalnoia . . . .what's that?" asked Onlig.

"Don't know . . . .read something about it years ago.  Some place where evil is born, nurtured, and then released unto the world.  And when it dies, it goes there again, and the cycle starts over." said Aristhma.

Onlig chuckled.

"I assure you we are not." said Onlig.

"I know.  Traim said so.  Call me too trusting, but hey!  Sometimes it helps." said Aristhma.

Onlig smiled, then turned his attention to Triam.

"How is he?" asked Onlig.

"Well . . . .you took the strongest blow of my Father's.  He should be alright.  He's sleeping now, I think." said Aristhma.

Onlig nodded.

"What is this place?" asked Onlig.

"The Cliffs of Chill.  Centuries ago, it was used as a torture device for prisoners of war.  Now, it's not used much.  But you should know by now, that you can die easily here, especially if you're out cold for hours.  The waves can crash you into the rocks, and the cold can give you hypothermia.  Not to mention the diseases you can get by swallowing the water!" said Aristhma.

"So, why are you here?" asked Onlig.

"I'm here to help you!  We can't get out the way we got in, because the waves splash into the Cliffs every five minutes.  And the cave's entrance is ten minutes away." said Aristhma.

"So . . . ?" asked Onlig.

"So, we take the secret way out. I discovered it one day as I was walking to go gather firewood.  I followed the path down until I got to this cave.  But the secret exit is 4 minutes away.  So unless we're fast, we'll never make it." explained Aristhma.

Onlig nodded.

"I see . . . " said Onlig.

"I don't think he's much in a running mood right now.  So, please, carry him." said Aristhma.

"Of course!" said Onlig, who walked over and picked up Triam, and placed him over his shoulder.

"Sadly, I can't keep the shield up while we're moving so, we have to time this just right!" said Aristhma.

Onlig nodded.

"I'll follow you." said Onlig.

Aristhma nodded and waited impatiently.

The sound of waves hitting rock sounded moment before the waves came crashing through the caves.  The chilling waves swept through the cave at amazing speed, but was stopped by the magick field protecting the three.  As soon as the waves subsided, Aristhma put down the field, and darted off towards the entrance.  Onlig darted after her.  

"We only have three and half minutes.  We have a few more meters to go!  Come on!" yelled Aristhma, running and dodging the various stalagmites and stalactites.  Onlig paid little attention to her, but kept running and following her.  He smelled the salt of the ocean on the rock, and the sea down below.  Aristhma jumped on a small rock and stopped.

"This is it!  Hurry!!  Only about two minutes! yelled Aristhma.

Onlig jumped on the same rock, and looked up.  He saw a small ledge five inches up, another five inches above that, and so on, up.  He wondered if he could fit through the 15 inch hole, but didn't spend a lot of time thinking about it.  He put Triam down, holding his arm in his own, and made a jump for it.  He grabbed it with his free paw, and pulled with all his might.  He knelt down and pulled Triam up.  He jumped again, barely managing to see Aristhma jump up for the ledge.  Again he scrambled up to the second ledge and placed Triam there.  He was about to jump for the third one when he heard Aristhma scream.  Onlig jumped down off the second ledge and looked down.  Aristhma had missed the ledge and fell down.  She had obviously gotten up again, but now her foot was stuck in a wedge between the rock and the cavern floor.  Onlig estimated he had about 50 seconds left before the waves crashed through the cave, so he jumped down and tried to pull Aristhma's foot free.  He heard the waves crash into the cliffs, and tugged with all his might.  He picked up Aristhma, jumped to the rock, saw the waves coming towards him, and jumped for the ledge above.  The waves hit his legs hard, throwing them against the nearby stalactite.  He winced in pain but refused to scream.  He felt the feeling in his legs go numb and he feared that his legs had been torn off.  The waves subsided, and he pulled him and Aristhma up.  He sat against the ledge's wall, and moaned and looked down at his legs.  They were still there, but he felt nothing.

"Thanks . . . " said Aristhma softly.

"Anytime." said Onlig.

"Here.  Let me help you." said Aristhma.  She raised her hands in the air and called upon some runes.

"What are you doing?" asked Onlig.

"Don't worry!" said Aristhma.  She let the runes go loose on Onlig's leg, healing them.

Onlig felt his legs return to his senses, and without pain.

"Thank you, Girl." said Onlig.

"It's Aristhma!  Now come on, let's go!" said Aristhma, standing up.  She jumped for the ledge, grabbed it, and pulled herself up.  

Onlig followed suit.  He picked up Triam, let Aristhma jump to the next ledge, then followed.

"How many of these ledges are there?" asked Onlig.

"About 20 or so.  The hardest one is the last one.  It's muddy, and quite high up." said Aristhma, jumping to the next ledge.

Onlig sighed.  The next couple hours will be long ones. 

****

Two hours after they had started, Onlig and Aristhma, carrying Triam, finally reached the last of their journey up the opening.

Onlig pulled himself unto the grass surrounding the opening.  The sun hurt his eyes due to their prolong exposure to the darkness.  He laid Triam's body on the ground next to him, and sighed.

"Why are you helping us, anyway?" asked Onlig.

"Because I think what Father did to you was wrong.  I don't think he should've put you into those caves even though you are from Nalnoia, which I also don't believe." said Aristhma.

"Oh . . . .smart girl." said Onlig.

Aristhma giggled.

"Thanks Mr. Khat." said Aristhma.

"Onlig." said Onlig.

"Okay . . . Onlig." said Aristhma.

Triam moaned and stirred.

"Triam?" asked Onlig.

Triam didn't respond.  He just lay there, as he had the entire escapade.

Onlig sighed.

"Don't worry.  He'll be okay." said Aristhma.

Onlig nodded.

"Oh!  I meant to ask you.  What is this?" asked Aristhma, pulling out an amber ring.

"Oh . . . .I found that on our last stop." said Onlig.

"Well . . . this is what caused Father to throw you in the cave." said Aristhma.

"Oh, I see.  What's so bad about it?" asked Onlig.

Aristhma shrugged.

Onlig nodded.

"Say . . . ?" asked Aristhma.

"Yes?" asked Onlig.

"You're exploring the world, right?" asked Aristhma.

Onlig nodded.

"Well . . . you don't know me very well, I don't know you either, but do you think that I could possibly, maybe, join you guys?  I could be helpful to ya, fending off creatures and evil attacks with my shields and magick spells.  And I'm not a Secian, but my healing spells are semi-adequate." said Aristhma.

Onlig thought about it.

"I suppose Triam wouldn't mind.  Sure, I guess.  but I'm not in charge of the mission, mind you, so, when he wakes up, maybe you should ask him too." said Onlig.

Aristhma nodded.

****

A few days later . . . .

"It was nice of your Father to magickally rebuild our ship for us, Aristhma." said Triam.

Aristhma giggled.

"Wasn't Father.  Father doesn't even know.  And it's not your old ship." said Aristhma.

"Hrm?" asked Onlig.

"Nope.  I totally made it from scratch . . . magick scratch, that is, from the wood I asked you guys to gather.  And as long as I'm on this journey with you, it'll stay like this.  Otherwise . . . .you'll find yourselves washed ashore another island." Aristhma said, giggling.

"Your father doesn't know you're coming with us?" asked Triam.

"Nuh uh." said Aristhma.

"Then we need to tell him." said Triam, heading for the plank.

"Please don't!!  He'd never agree, and he'd probably think you guys are trying to kidnap me or something and throw you guys back in that cave.  And I hate being cooped up on this island.  It's so boring.  Please don't tell him." begged Aristhma.

Triam sighed and nodded.

"I won't." said Triam.

"Thanks Triam, sir!!" said Aristhma, happily.  She ran over and hugged Triam, and, behind his back, dropped a small parchment into a bottle down to the beach.

"Anytime." said Triam, smiling.  "Onlig?"

"Yes Tri?" asked Onlig.

"Prepare the sail and grab the wheel.  Get us out of here!" said Triam.

"Aye aye!" said Onlig.

The new ship, with full mast, pulled away from the beach and headed eastwards, towards the horizon.


**What lies ahead, beyond the horizon, for our travelers?  What was that parchment Aristhma dropped to the beach?  And what will her father do when he discovers Aristhma missing?  This, and more, in the next edition of Sagely Wonderings!**

Fare Ye Well My Beloved
By Caille Morsdatter


It is that time between midnight and dawn when the night is blackest. A young human female slips from the shadows of the docks and moves quietly to the edge of the sea. Standing at the water's edge she scans the horizon as if force of will could make the ship she seeks appear. Bowing her head, she realizes that she is too late and he has sailed. She remains at the water's edge for a time, her head spinning with memories, dreams, and regrets. Her thoughts are centered around a jet black Leuian, whom she now knows, she will never see again. He has returned to his homeland to live out his days. A sad smile tugs at the corners of her mouth as she remembers her first sight of him. It was in the Merchant's shop in the Training Grounds of Spur that her life changed forever the moment he strode through the door.

For what seemed to be hours she stood in that shop listening intently to the adventurers as they came in to make their purchases or sell what they had acquired in their travels. New to the land, she was equipped with naught but the standard issue backpack, torch, water and rations given to all upon entering the training area for those seeking fame and fortune in the city of Spur. Several times she attempted to gain the shopkeeper's attentions but was pushed aside by those familiar with the elf behind the counter. Having signed on as a fighter she knew that without some serviceable weapon her days would be short. Suddenly the door burst open and the largest khat she'd ever seen came striding in.

It seemed that most of those in the crowded room knew him and stopped what they were about to call out a greeting or ask where he'd been in hopes of an invitation to join him on a hunt. Unbeknownst to her, his prowess with a sword and his uncanny ability to sense the best hunting spots were legendary among those living in the training grounds. The young recruits knew that traveling with Stifferd would see them wealthier than most other expedition leaders and his healing abilities were a boon to those unskilled adventurers busy honing their abilities in hopes of traveling to Spur. Stifferd always did his level best to see everyone who signed on with him safely back and their pockets lined with silvers.

Seizing her opportunity, Caille slipped through the distracted adventurers and up to the counter. The shopkeeper scowled at her as she stammered her request to see his wares. Quiet fell over the shop as if sparkling silver sleep dust had been sprinkled over them all. The shop keeper refused to acknowledge her amid quiet snickering among the other patrons. Having been in her shoes, the other travelers knew that without the properly worded request she'd leave empty handed. As she started to turn away from the counter, her silvery gray eyes flashing with anger and embarrassment, the khat reached out and gently grasped her by the elbow. "Greetings m'lady I'm Stifferd Spinaltap, Sword of Odarous, at yer service,"  he said quietly, "what purchase did ye need to make? Mayhaps I can help." 

He towered over her at well over six feet. As she looked up into his reddish brown eyes, her breath caught and her heart skipped a beat. Not trusting her voice to anything more, she whispered to him "I'm in need of a sword." He pulled her up next to him at the counter and whispered the appropriate words she should use. The shopkeeper, amused and somewhat leery of the khat, quickly displayed his collection of edged weapons. "Examine them carefully," Stifferd whispered to her, "He'd just as soon cheat ye as look at ye." Stifferd then guided her hand to the simple sword on the end of the counter and nodded his approval. The shopkeeper had laid it almost beyond her reach hoping she'd foolishly favor the more expensive weapons. The sword fit her hand as if made for her and she quickly handed over her coins to the ornery shopkeeper. Caille beamed up at him and said "Thank ye sir, ye've been most kind."

Her business concluded, Caille turned towards the door when he laid a paw lightly on her arm. "Would ye care to join me in a hunt m'lady?" he offered. Not believing her luck she quickly agreed to follow him. They slipped out into the cool night air. Caille's eyes wide at all the new sights and sounds of her new surroundings. Stifferd fielded her questions graciously giving her a quick tour of the grounds.

He led her to a black obsidian gate north of town and bade her to ready her sword. Stepping boldly through the gate he sniffed the air and grinned. The next thing she knew Caille was face to face with a sight she'd not soon forget. There before her was one of the undead that haunted the graveyard they had entered. Terrified she quickly began to hack and slash at the zombie. Stifferd stood back for a moment, taking her measure before joining in to help. He stepped in, rattling off pointers to her to improve her stance and which move would be most effective. At one point it looked as if the creature would overcome her and he quickly placed himself between her and her opponent, shielding her with his body. "Do not be afraid to retreat, m'lady, there's no shame in stepping back and treating yer wounds," he scolded over his shoulder. Lifting her chin willfully, Caille raised her sword and took one last swing.

The zombie moaned and fell silent and still at her feet. Stifferd laughed and applauded her; grudging approval in the dazzling smile he flashed her. "Stubborn one ye are," he smirked. He bent over the corpse and took out his dagger. With a single deft movement he removed a claw from the creature. "Strip him m'lady, that one's all yers," he chuckled as he handed her the claw. She accepted the claw and slipped it in her backpack as a trophy of her first kill. Many months later, she would lovingly place that claw in a coral encrusted bronze locket he slipped her with a kiss. A reminder of their first meeting and first adventure together nestled close to her heart as he will always be.

The figure on the beach is seated now. Knees pulled up to her chin and her arms wrapped tightly around herself. She rocks slowly to and fro. Caught between the sweetness of her memories of him and the grief that threatens her will to live she bows her head and weeps. As the sky begins to lighten she raises her head. Slowly moving to her feet she removes a scrap of parchment from the pocket of her coat and slips it in a glass bottle found on the beach. "Fare ye well, my beloved," she whispers to the air, "Know that ye'll always have my heart." She eases the bottle into the water, praying that it finds him, and brushes the sand from her cold fingertips. As she turns back toward Spur a warm breeze kisses her forehead as the first light of day softly caresses her cheek.

Psycian's Saga: The Adventures of Roien Daysien
Episode One: The Beginning, Part 1
By Alazam Duri


The harsh winds blew through the treetops of the dark and foreboding forest, causing the ancient limbs to bend and creak. One might be given the impression that these massive trees were alive. The black wood stretched out in a never ceasing mass toward the horizon. 

The only indication of life in the void created by the shadows of the trees was coming from the light of what appeared to be a small camp fire. If one gazed closely enough, three figures could be seen moving about. 

The slightest creak here and a rustle there made the young Leuian jump and twitch. Cautiously he gazed about his surroundings, ready to spring to action as soon as his sharp senses detected the slightest hint of danger. The sinister air of the forest didn't seem to upset his Psycian companion nor the wolf at his side. 

The Psycian seemed immersed in what he was doing, scribbling away his thoughts into a rather large text.

"I don't like this place, Roien." whined the Leuian, drawing his bastard sword from its sheath. "Be best if we keep moving."

There was a sudden rustle in the brush near the camp which made the wolf at the Psycian's side spring to its feet and growl. Roien put down his quill and glanced about the camp. He could barely make out anything in the darkness of the wood, even the light provided by the camp fire was no help. 

Instinctively the young man closed his eyes and began to concentrate. Suddenly his head began to shimmer with a blue aura then faded away when he opened his eyes.

The young Psycian grinned, "It's only a couple of rats in the brush.", he pointed in the direction of the noise.

Immediately the wolf let out a muffled sigh of relief, then glanced at the Leuian and sat back down beside his master. Roien patted the wolf gently on the head and fiddled with the gold collar about its neck and whispered, "Good boy, Sasha."  Then he picked up his pen and began writing again. The young khat was still at his guard.  

Glancing for a moment at the young khat, Roien let out a big laugh that made the Leuian feel childish. 

"Wileykat, you really ought to relax. You're so tense I'm afraid your limbs will pop out of their sockets," Roien finished with a chuckle. 

"Its quite safe I assure you, my telepathic probe of the area only picked up those rats."

"Well I still don't like this place, its eerie, and I keep getting the feeling the trees are watching us." answered Wileykat, eyes still searching the perimeter of the camp.

Roien stopped writing again and patted Sasha on the head. "He's just a big scaredy khat isn't he boy?", both the Roien and the wolf seemed to laugh at the same time.

"Go on, laugh if you must!" Wileykat finished with a pout, returned his blade, and sat down near the fire.

Normally an insult like that made to a Leuian would mean ones death, but Wileykat is not your average Leuian. He possesses the catlike appearance and reflexes of his people, but Wileykat is untrained as a warrior and was raised by Roien. He was brought up to be a scholar and not much a fighter, plus the fact he's only sixteen. 

The young kit had come to look upon Roien as an older brother, father type figure. Roien had found the young khat while on one of his travels orphaned and alone. The young Leuian stood at about 5 feet 3 inches tall, and had orange hair and auburn eyes. He was in the process of being trained in the ways of a Sword Cleric of Sa, until the hand of fate mysteriously cut his training short when they arrived in this sinister place.

Wileykat peered into the crackling flames of the fire, then fixed his gaze on Sasha, the wolf lying next to Roien. Sasha was a noble and majestic looking wolf. Unlike his feral cousins, Sasha is very intelligent and loyal. He would lay down his own life to protect that of his master. Together the three have been through many adventures.

Roien regarded Sasha as his most trusted advisor and dearest of friends. Together they braved many perilous quests. Roien has a telepathic link with his companion which allows the two to communicate with each other. 

Wileykat would sometimes sit for hours and watch the two of them have conversations, never once seeing Sasha speak a word, only see Roien's reactions. 

"If one didn't know that Roien was a telepath they would think him a mad man", Wileykat thought as he chuckled.

Now Wileykat fixed his gaze on his mentor. He watched as Roien put his thoughts on paper. Wileykat blinked to discover Roien was no longer moving the quill with his hand but with his mind, one of the many psionic abilites Roien is blessed with. The tiny pen scribbled so fast that Wileykat could barely see it, moving with every thought Roien projected.

Unlike the average 4 to 5 foot tall Psycian, Roien stands at a good 6 feet tall. He has a good build and is stronger than most his brethren, perhaps a product of Human blood introduced into his family line. If Roien himself would not mention to others that he was Psycian people would mistake him for a Human. 

He has golden hair and eyes the color of the ocean. He considers himself a loner amongst his people, wandering here and there in search of new adventures.

An accomplished mage, Roien with his skill in rune magick and psionics alone is a match for the best of warriors. Although Roien is a RuneMage by trade, he is also an accomplished swordsman and weilder of the quarter staff. 

"There comes a time when the mind and magick fail and brute strength is needed.", was Roien's constant lecture to Wileykat. 

Such a phrase is ironic when it comes to a Psycian, to whom the mind and magick are usually the only means of defense.

Ever since Wileykat could remember, Roien was always there for him. The young mage taught him everything he knows, even about his own latent psi potential. Eventually when Wileykat was old enough he made the decision to enter the Sword Cleric Guild and learn the ways of the holy warrior. He still needs a lot of work.

The camp fire slowly began to die out and the gloom began to creep in.  Roien, pausing a moment from his writing, made a gesture with his hand.  A number of tiny runes began to dance about his hands then shot out towards the dying cinders.  

The runes struck their target and the fire blazed with full force once again.  By now Sasha had fallen asleep and Wileykat was about to do the same.

"Do you think we'll ever get home Roien?"  Wileykat asked with a yawn as he lay himself down next to the fire.

Roien, suddenly affected by the question, peered into the roaring flames with a distant look on his face, then cast a glance at the black rune inscribed book in his open leather backpack. 

"Lets just worry about getting out of this forest first.", he answered the young khat with a reassuring smile, then began to write again.

"What are you writing about anyway?" asked the Wiley sleepily.

"Oh a record of events and everything that's happened to us since we left Spur.", answered the young mage, not moving his lips when he said it, the words echoing around the camp.

"That's all?" snickered the young Leuian as he yawned.

Roien raised an eyebrow then chuckled, "Well someone has to tell our tale, might as well be me."

"Can I hear some of it?"

Roien raised an eyebrow, "Really? Its kind of boring, and not very good . . . "

"Just read!", interrupted Wileykat with a grin.

Roien began to flip through the pages of his leather bound text, found a suitable part, and began to read. Just as he began the winds started to wail through the treetops again. The ancient limbs swaying and creaking, seeming almost to be reaching down towards the camp. 

The gloom of the forest began to creep closer and closer. Roien wrapped himself in a blanket, then made another gesture with his hands. A number of tiny runes started glowing and began to dance above his head! Instantly the camp was surrounded by a pale blue aura.

"There, that should keep any intruders out." Roien thought to himself as he read.

Roien cleared his throat, then began: "Greetings friends, my name is Roien Daysien and I am a Psycian RuneMage. By now I must be in my twenty-eighth year of life. The following texts are a record of my life and the events which I have experienced as written and accounted by myself and my most trusted of friends.

 I started my life within the city of Spur and all its familiar surroundings. Now I find myself lost in an unknown world, without a clue as to where I am or how to get home. It seems all I can do, to maintain my sanity, is keep a written record of all the events that have happened to me thus far.

Perhaps this is a dream and nothing more, but I keep this record to prove to myself that it is in fact very real. As to how I arrived in this strange land is another tale, which I will eventually get around to telling. For now I will start at the beginning . . . "

Wileykat had fallen asleep before the first sentence had even began . . . 

*********************

Night had just spread it's dark veil over the city of Spur the night we were taken from our home. Not long after twilight, a shadowy mist began to creep over the city, filling everything it touched with a sense of dread and death. The source of this foul mist seemed to be coming from somewhere in the Poor Quarter . . . 

The townsfolk were all in a mad dash to head towards their homes. Merchants closed their shops, women gathered their children, and the beggars and urchins scurried to their shacks and sewers. No one in their right mind would set out on a night like this.

Even the Governor increased the number of guards patroling his estate and the surrounding areas of the city. Whatever was occuring this night the Governor wasn't going to be caught by surprise. Even the few adventurers in Town Square were reluctant to venture out this evening.

"Boy I hate nights like this, its getting that the gov'nor don't pay us enough for this.", grumbled a city guardsman to his captian.

"Aye I agree, maybe we should just march straight up to his door and demand we get a raise!", chuckled the guard captain.

At that moment there was a sudden cry for help at the northwest corner of Town Square! Due to the mist the two guards couldn't make heads or tails of what was going on. The men quickly ran towards the direction the cry came from.

The guards arrived at the area and to their surprise saw three dark robed individuals and a man lying on the ground.

"Now, see here, what's going on!", exclaimed the guard captain as he drew his razor-sharp steel saber from its sheath.

"Why officer, we were merely offering aid to this poor unfortunate soul.", said the dark priest in a cold voice.

"Yeah I know what kinda aid you people give, now stand back!", ordered the captain saber ready in hand.

"You heard him, get away from that man!", exclaimed the city guardsman his steel pike at the ready.

"But we haven't finished what we started . . . ", the dark priest said with a sinister smile.

"And just what exactly are you doing?", interrupted the captian angrily.

"Why collecting his soul . . . ", cackled the dark priest has he removed a glowing red orb from his robes.

The dark priest then quickly knelt beside the dying townsman and waved the orb over his head. The orb began to glow and blaze!

Before the two guards could react, the injured man was instantly covered in a blazing green flame that consumed his entire flesh! The man screamed in agony as his soul was ripped from his charred body and absorbed into the depths of the orb!

"Murdering bastards!, yelled the city guardsman as he lunged for one of the dark robed men with his pike!

His attack was a good one! His razor sharp pike piercing one of the dark priests straight through the chest, emerging on the other side with its bloody heart implaled on the tip of the pike, still beating and oozing blood everywhere! 

He then lunged after another only missing this time, that proved to be a fatal mistake.

The second priest struck a critical blow to the guard's head  with a steel morningstar, forcing him to fall to the ground, his head a bloody mess staining the ground red.

"No! You bastards, that's my younger brother!", cried the captain as he raced towards the remaining priests, saber flying at them!

The captain managed to deliver a perfect blow to one of the priests severing its arm, blood splashing everywhere and sending the priest screaming to the ground where he finally bled to death! 

At that moment three cult fanatics leaped from the mists and attacked the captain! One delivered an exceptional blow to the captain's head with an wooden club knocking him near paralyzed to the ground.

"Heh heh heh heh! You see my good captain, no one can stop the dark forces, especially pitiful excuses for soldiers like yourself!", bellowed the dark priest.

"This one's already dead.", said one of the cult fanatics leaning over the body of the dead guardsman.

"Bah! He's no use to us then, we need them alive to extract the souls. Well at least we have the capatin here. His soul is strong and will help our cause greatly.", smiled the dark priest as he began to walk over to where the captain lay.

Just as the priest was about to wave the orb over the head of the captain, the captain made one last attempt to reach his brother's body. His hand was able to touch his brother's and he shed a single tear before the raging  green flames of the orb consumed his body and his soul.

"Soon we will have gathered enough souls, then the dark portal will open and we shall rule this city! What of the the dagger, the girl, and the sacred book?", demanded the head priest to the fanatics.

"We managed to get the dagger with the aid of a few thieves from Taath's temple and the girl and the book are being gathered as we speak.", responed one of the fanatics.

"Excellent, let me see the dagger!", commanded the head priest.

One of the fanatics removed a stained pouch from his cloak and handed it to the head priest.

The priest quickly opened the pouch and removed a blood-stained black rune inscribed horn dagger.

"At last, the dagger made from the horn of the archdemon Lahgos is mine! The very demon that on this night will come forth and consume the entire city! Come, the time is drawing near, let us return to the temple. Muha ha ha ha ha ha ha!", cackled the dark priest.

And with that the priest and his followers retreated back to their sanctuary in the Poor Quarter . . . 

***********************

Meanwhile at the Mage's Guild in the Guild District . . . 

A shadowbeast clawed at Wileykat nearly tearing him in two! The young khat lunged at it with his short sword to no avail, the sword went right through it.

"Hahaha, weapons are no use on things here my boy, you have to use magick!", chuckled Roien as he watched the fight from the side of the Phantasmal Arena.

"Bah! I don't see you in here, now shut up and let me concentrate!", yelled Wiley as he attempted to summon a spell to fend off the creature.

Crackling energy began to form all around the young Leuian's body, the energy then quickly gathered together and formed into a blazing sword and slashed at the beast! The shadowbeast was severed in several electrified pieces and vanished in a puff of smoke! The lightning sword slowly faded away.

"Well done, well done!", Roien said as he clapped.

"Heh, wasn't that hard!", chuckled Wiley.

"Hmm well I say we give him something a bit harder, what do you say boy?", Roien, his mood now amused chuckled as he asked his wolf, Sasha.

Sasha gave a nod of agreement and quickly Roien flipped through the rune inscribed book sitting on a podium in front of the arena.

"Hmmm, yes, yes! This will do nicely!", Roien said with a sinister smirk as he read the incantation from the book.

Suddenly a swirling mist began to form all around the arena! The young khat was ready for anything, that is until he heard the sinister primal chanting in the background . . . 

"Ack! I know that sound!", the young khat said with a growl of both anger and fear!

Suddenly a swirl of leaves began to form at the center of the arena and a tark totem beast appeared!

"Oooo, I'm gonna get you for this Roien!", Wiley yelled as he dodged each of the totem beast's blows.

"Heh heh heh, this is great! I'd pay to see this rather than the dull Gladiator games any day!", chuckled Roien as he watched Wileykat get beaten about the arena by the imaginary totem beast.

"Grrrr . . . ", was Wileykat's only remark as he began to concentrate again.

The totem beast clawed at the young Leuian then soared 40 feet into the air! Wileykat managed to leap up into the air and began chanting! Crackling energy began to form around his fingers and he sent a lightning bolt crashing towards the totem beast!

The lightning bolt struck the totem beast hard and it fell 40 feet back to the ground!

The air began to ripple all around Wileykat's body. Wileykat then raised his fist and it was consumed by raging flames! He then leaped into the air again and sent the Fist of Fire soaring towards the totem beast!

The Fist of Fire exploded on the totem beast causing it to vanish in a blinding flash!

"Good shot my boy, good shot! You definitely are getting better!", applauded Roien.

"You know had it been a real totem, I doubt you could've finished it off like that, but good show all the same, I'd say you're ready to train again.", Roien chuckled as he threw Wiley a towel.

"Hrmph! Sometimes I think you make me train here just so you and Sasha can get a quick laugh at my expense.", muttered Wiley has he wiped himself clean with the towel.

The three friends then glanced at each other, a moment of silence went by, followed by simultaneous laughter!

"Ha ha ha ha, what . . . ha ha ha . . . gave you that impression . . . hehehe hee ha ha ha ha ha?", Roien attempted to say as he rolled on the floor laughing.

"Psycians, I never will understand their sense of humor!", Wileykat said as he rolled his eyes and chuckled.

At that moment Sasha's keen ears raised and he leaped to his feet! He began growling in a low tone to alert his friends of approaching danger.

"What's wrong boy, you hear something?", asked Roien.

There was a sudden crash that sounded like broken glass.

"Shhh, did you hear that?", asked Wileykat as we drew his short sword.

"Sounded like it came from the guild library." Roien said queitly.

"I thought you said the mages don't work this late at night.", Wileykat whispered.

"They don't now quiet before they hear us! Sasha, make your way to the library and see what's going on!", exclaimed Roien quietly.

Sasha nodded and quickly left the arena and made his way towards the guild's library. The wolf stealthed his way into the open door of the library and surveyed the scene. Meanwhile back in the arena Roien sat down, closed his eyes, and began to concentrate.

Roien's head suddenly began to glow! Instantly his mind was linked with that of Sasha's and he was seeing and hearing through the wolf's eyes and ears . . . 

There were several dark figures in black robes. Each of them appeared to be searching for something. They were grabbing books off the shelves, flipping through them, and discarding them to the floor in a mad frenzy.

"What's happening Roien?", Wiley asked only to get slapped in the face.

"Hush! You'll break my concentration!", snapped Roien.

"Sorry, geez!", muttered Wiley.

"There are several men in black robes in the library, they appear to be searching for something."

"Black robes? Sounds like cultists or Taathians to me.", Wiley added.

"Aye, they sure do look like cultists."

"What are we going to do? Should we stop them?", asked Wiley.

"Lets see what they're after first. Then we strike!", Roien said.

Sasha kept a low profile near the library door, quietly observing the black robed men in the room with his keen yellow eyes. Several of them were still searching the shelves while others were now smashing open glass display cases.

"I found it! I found it! I found the Book of Lahgos!", cried a cult fanatic.

"Lahgos, now why does that sound familiar?", Roien pondered.

"Excellent! This should make Mardor happy! Come let us return to the temple!", commanded a priest to the fanatics.

"Ack, they found what they came for, quick or else they'll get away!", exclaimed Roien as he leaped to his feet.

Both Roien and Wileykat raced towards the library arriving just before the cultists could escape!

"Hold it right there! Just what do you think you're doing here!", commanded Roien.

"Nothing that concerns you boy, now be gone before you get hurt!", bellowed the dark priest in a sinister tone.

"I believe that's guild property you've just trashed and stolen, return that book at once and we may spare your lives.", Roien said loudly.

The group of cultists began to laugh darkly.

"Ha ha ha, you amuse me boy, you expect us to believe that you, that pitiful excuse for a pup, and that kitten will be able to stop us? Its a pitty we have to kill you!", the dark priest cackled.

The dark priest then raised the black rune inscribed book above his head.

"Behold the Book of Lahgos! With this book we shall finally be able to rule this city and the entire world! Muha ha ha ha! Kill them!", the dark priest commanded.

At that moment the group cult fanatics dashed towards Roien and his friends each with his heart set on killing them.

One smashed at Wileykat with an iron mace, he missed! Wileykat then countered by driving his sword into the fanatics side and sliced all the way to the front of the fanatic's body, then withdrawing the sword, leaving the fanatic rolling on the ground in agony with his endtrails hanging out!

The second stabbed at Roien with a dagger, the cultist managed to slice his arm, but that would be the only blow it who make. Roien quickly began concentrating and sent a bolt of mental energy towards the second fanatic. The psi bolt exploded on the fanatic's head causing him to scream out in terrible pain and fell to the ground.

Blood was oozing from the nose and ears of the fanatic as he trembled on the floor then finally died.

A third leaped at Roien, this time to be caught by one of Roien's spells! Roien began to gesture at the cultist and several glistening strands began to form around his hands! The strands then flew towards the fanatic entagling him in an Acid Web, the fanatic's flesh smoking and blistering where the strands of the web touched his flesh causing the fanatic to scream out in terrible pain!

Wileykat finished off a fourth fanatic in a few swift blows! Sasha to managed to kill a few as well. The remaining fanatics started to back off and retreat!

"Where are you going you fools, I suppose if you want something done right, you have to do it yourself! Behold the dark power of Lahgos!", yelled the priest as he held the black book above his head and began chanting.

Suddenly bolts of dark energy began pulsing from the book and swirling around the body of the dark priest! The energy began to concentrate above the head of the priest then crashed in a black thunder bolt towards Roien! The dark thunder stuck Roien hard and pummeled him to the ground surrounding his body in a terrible web of thunder!

"Roien, no!", Wileykat yelled as he attempted to reach his injured friend.

Just then another dark bolt struck the young Leuian knocking him to near death, the same dark web of thunder surrounding him!

"Ha ha ha ha! Fools! No one can stop the dark forces!", bellowed the dark priest.

Then Sasha suddenly leaped up from behind the dark priest, clawed at him, and caused the priest to drop the book and lose his concentration of the spell on Roien and Wileykat! The dark thunder bolts dissapated from around Roien and Wiley and the two regained consciousness. Then quickly the two invoked healing spells on themselves.

"Damn mut, I'll teach you what it means to attack me!", the dark priest growled as he picked up the book and directed it at Sasha, still growling and ready to strike again.

Sasha leaped up at the dark priest once again, his claws extended, this time caught by the dark energy from the book! The wolf was suspended in mid air by pulsing jolts of dark energy eminating from the cursed book!

"Heh heh hee now be gone you foul pest!", the dark priest commanded as he gestured the book swiftly towards the nearby wall.

Sasha's body went flying with deadly force towards the western wall of the library! The wolf's broken and bloody body crashed straight to the other side of the crumbled wall!

"Sasha! Noooooooooo!", Roien cried out, still attempting to recover from the last attack.

"Heh heh heh! Fear not, soon the great Lahgos will rise and come forth from the realm of darkness and you will join your pitiful mut!", cackled the dark priest.

"My time is running short I'm afraid, perhaps we'll meet again, if you're lucky that is! Until then here's a little gift from Lahgos to keep you busy while I escape!", cackled the dark priest again as he raised the cursed book above his head.

The black rune inscribed book began to blaze with a dark fire! Suddenly two jolts of dark energy bolted from the book towards the ground in front of Roien and Wileykat! The jolts formed two dark fissures in the ground from which a terrible stench of death and decay emerged! Instantly two pairs of clawed hands emerged from within the fissures revealing two lesser demons!

"Heh heh heh, its been a pleasure boys, but I have a prior engagement to attend, tah tah!", cackled the dark priest as he once again waved the black book above his head.

A huge bolt of black thunder leaped from the book towards the ceiling of the library creating a huge opening in the roof! The dark priest began chanting once again and suddenly two massive demonic wings emerged from his back! The priest quickly took to the air and soared through the opening in the roof!

Sordum The Big-Headed Psion
By Aubrei Rashakae (1st place winner, 12/27/98)

You know Sweetie and Syrus and Surtur and Beth(any)
Mestof(fa) and Aubrei and Rrylar and Vorach
But do you recall, the most big- headed Psion of all?
Sordum the Glow headed Psion, had a very shiny head.  (It was huge!)
and if you ever saw it, you might be fused or dead (In the games, of course)
All of the other psions, use to laugh and not let him eat cakes ( The Drag-al ones)
They always made poor Sordum beat up on the big ole' drakes (like Michael'a)

Then one lonely Rinannimas eve, Skyta Claws came to growl (Grr Grr Grr)
"Sordum with your head so big, won't you call some girls for this mistletoe sprig
(Smootch, smootch smooch)
Then all the Psions loved him, as they contacted all with glee, (Yipee!)
Sordum the Big headed Psion, you'll go down in history (Like that great Wyllow person).

The Snow Queen
By Aviandha Waterqueen

As I came across a cave of snow
The stars were twinkling with a glistening glow
Diamond icicles stretching down all in a row
I had no other place to go . . . 

I stepped inside this magickal place
And looking around found not a trace
But a silvery light that danced in a race
And the snow was soft in this case . . . 

I heard a soft, kind warm whisper..
Turning quickly I was afraid to miss her . . . 
I found myself looking straight in the eyes . . . 

She stood there in her grace and glory
and this is why I tell the story . . . 
She was tall and frosty white
with long Sparkling hair, and her smile was pinched tight

Her eyes pierced the darkest shadows
And her dress of White fur flowed gently behind her
and if you listened quietly . . .  you could hear
The jingling of the jewel . . .  a tear

hanging around her long thing neck
I jumped from this sight, for I was a wreak
scared and confused I saw her as a threat
I closed my eyes to count to 10
and when I opened them again . . . 

 She was gone.. without a trace.

Upon the chime of wintry day
The winds of ice will blow.
They whip and whirl and the snow they curl
and blanket everything we know.

Dancing amongst the sun's meek rays
The winds of ice will breathe
In the streets they dance, in your hair they prance
And blowing through the reeds.

Of Rinnanimas past the wind has played
A very substantial role
For the season rides in on the wintry winds
Causing your breathe to fold.


Along the winding, narrowing path
A young and innocent soul did trek
With glimmering eyes and a gleaming nose

One can tell the child is sick.
She happened upon a barren field
Encircling a single tree.
The branches were scarce and needles were gone

And it looked pretty shabby indeed.
A moment of thought her eyes lit up
To her head, her hands flew deftly.
Untying her shawl from around her neck.

She shredded it oh so calmly.
Tying each strip into intricate shapes
With knots and bows and curls.
She tied them onto the tree that eve

And smile with a loving glow.
I believe that day a tradition was made
Where Spurians decorate the trees.
With loving hearts and silent hands

Their ornaments hang like leaves.
So every year in joyous fashion
We string so delicately.
Shining gems and flowing strings and candles all in rows.
Along the limbs of vacant trees.
And remember them wherever we go.

A Carol of Kinship
By Marigold Lyrian (1st place winner, 12/25/98)

The bright bells ring, 
And glad we sing,
For all our joyous tidings;
The candles are lighted, 
And darkness is blighted,
And in each heart, love is abiding.

Now our carols we shout, 
All glum are things cast out,
And our hands we extend with a smile;
For today, this one day,
We cast malice away,
To be dear, welcomed friends for a while.

No more sadness tonight,
While the moon shines its light
On the soft gleaming snowdrifts and flurries,
Be a stranger to care,
All things jolly and fair;
Stay a bit now, there's no need to hurry.

Pale faeries of frost glitter gently,
When the bonfires crackle intently,
And the icicles glimmer with stardust and cheer;
There is time, if you wish,
To steal off with a kiss,
As we herald the turning of seasons to years.

One last drink with us, friend,
'Gainst the chill winter wind,
Warm the air as our hearts warm with laughter;
One last toast to your health,
And the truest of wealth . . . 
In the good will we bear, ever-after.

***

Hullo! This is Blister the Brave, Burrowmaster, Professional purse cleaner by trade, Veteran warrior, Ex-Archmage, and Pro Marbles player, part-time Fortune teller, town crier, apprentice Fungi gardener, keeper of the lost and found . . . 

Anyway, this is a new little article Marigold is going to let me try, apparently she owes me a favor.  Or maybe its because I know about her ____ . . . 

~ Well, let's see . . .  Sir Jazbo was recently promoted to Arms Master, and Leader of the Council Knights.  That was all due to his capture of the Assassin plaguing Spur for some time.  And leaving by a horrible mess, I'd hate to see his room.  

Even more recently, the assassin was set for execution the next day at noon; apparently before anyone knew what was happening he croaked right over dead!  Witnesses said they saw two holes in his corpse.  Included was a message about how 10 more will come if they ever try to kill him again.  Guess that means Jazbo didn't catch the real killer, does that mean he gets to keep his promotion?

~ This may be a little late, but, Ferronogon finally staged black.  Sadly, he didn't make it, though a witness reported seeing him try to fly up to the sky. 

"He had a strange look on his face, almost as if he knew he was about to die.  He seemed very peaceful and complete.  Sure enough he flew up with all his heart and strength, and he came plummeting down.  Very sad indeed . . . Of course, I never did like Dragons, always eating my cattle."

Ferro made a lot of people mad, yet even more were sad to hear of his death.  Rest in Peace, Ferro!

~ The recent Rinnanimas Festival was a hit!  Economy is said to be booming thanks to the Merchants, and adventurers are happier than ever with their new goodies.  Silly gadgets are being bought by rich Dragons for ridiculous prices,  proving that yes, it must be the Holidays indeed!  Oh, and let me take this time to remind everyone to keep a safe eye on their pouches.  Thieves lurk everywhere at these Festivals you know!  As a matter of fact, I seem to find purses laying around everywhere these days.  I have one here with the initials M.D . . . Anyone know an M.D.? Maybe, he's a doctor . . . 

The Festival was timed perfectly, coinciding with all the snowfalls; in fact, you should keep an eye out for Khane, as he seems to have hoarded them all . . . Could be planning some kind of ultimate snowball war!  

If anyone sees a fat, naked man running around, you should go to Skymath.  Someone stole the Fat man's Black boots, and red fur-lined Coat!  I, however, would like to know how Skymath came across the clothes . . .

~ Also, in contrast to the happy Rinannimas festivities- There have been many strange earthquakes shaking Spur.  Houses in the Poor Quarter, the Bank, and certain areas along Trade Way were damaged. 

Coincidentally, the Demon cocoon seemed to change colors and grow some more.  The tension around is getting very tight; can't we just pay Smakem to lift it out of here and throw into the Saldaean Sea? And even weirder, some Gnomes came by with a barrel of yellow apples.  Of course, some of our brighter citizens were the first to eat the unknown food.  Sweetie said they were poisoned, but then, who believes Sweetie?

~A couple of weeks later, the cocoon hatched.  Made a real dramatic entrance and killed a few people… Witnesses say one stride with his foot reached to the Guild district.  The footprint is still there!  Then, he ripped a big hole in the sky, and started mumbling about how he has to dominate his realm first, and then he was going to come back for us.  After that, he threw a fireball down toward the Dragons' Lair and said, "That one's for you, Teldor." Then he stepped into his hole, and both he and the hole were gone.   I hope everyone has thanked Teldor.

~ Speaking of Drakes, the black Drake, Zuberi Goldenfeather finally found all the missing pieces to the Golem.  He brought it to some Gnomish tinker and got a big ole Golem made!  Apparently, it did fly but the fan broke off almost immediately after it was made.  Heck, I'm surprised it works as well as it does so far.. 

~ Sweetie Niftyswift has been plagued by some past demon of Taath which possesses her soul.  It's rather intermittent.  Anyway, you might want to watch out, I was almost a sacrifice!  Actually, I was a bit disappointed . . . never been sacrificed to anything you know . . . Oh well, if you ask me its just due to overdose, or lack thereof, of the Psycian drug..

~ Speaking of Psycians, an Order of the Psi has been organized.  It seems to be quite popular, probably due to the ridiculous amounts of Psycians and Psions.  I still haven't found out the purpose in it.  Maybe someone could fill me in?  If you want to join, contact Alazam.  Rumor has it, Old Man Milanden disapproves of the younger Psycians letting non-Psycians into this Order of the Psi, and he further disapproves of their being allowed into the Guild.  He doesn't believe they can handle the power.  Which brings up an interesting question- who let Mestoffa into the Guild?

~A very scrawny, and very scared kid was seen running around Spur with a message.  Before he could deliver his message, Kitsa Laetis attacked the kid (way to go Kitsa, ya big bully!).  I think I also saw her steal his lunch.  Anyway, he seemed a bit snotty and didn't want to put up with it so he went and got his big brother.  Predictably, he was rather powerful.  A black-robed Archpriest.  He was about to deliver his message when he was challenged by a young Psycian by the name of Sylane.  Even though Khane was teaming up on the Archpriest, another one appeared and they both called upon the power of their gods to kill Sylane.  No one saw Khane slip out.

Well, after someone served him a drink, he stated, "Hands of the Lord have been brought forth . . . the left hand and the right hand, they are two, the soulless. The great Lord has risen in power with the resurrection of these two servants, whose souls now belong to the Lord himself."  That's the gist of it, I believe he also was talking about it being the one Mighty Lord: The Lord of dead, lord of the demons, and lord of . . . well I think it was ignorance?  He also mentioned how his Lord's temple will be the only one that will stand.  Could this Lord be Taath?  

~ Apparently, the Master Tattooist, Zaco Detaco was marking his territory.  Kitsa Laetis was seen walking around with "Zaco were here" tattooed on her body.  When asked, Kitsa said she has no idea what the meaning was.  But, he is a Gobbie . . . Let's just hope he doesn't resort to 'marking' people in more . . . primitive ways.  In even more recent news, Kitsa now has a Tattoo of a horned Anthian with the Taathian mark which replaced Zaco's tattoo.  Kitsa still has no idea why she received the tattoo, or who gave it to her.  What I want to know is this- how does someone tattoo you without knowing it? Maybe she's a real heavy sleeper . . .

~ High Priestess of Set, Reason Valencia was seen kissing Pelian, a Cleric of Set, in Treehaven.  When asked, Reason denied it (as she leaned her head on Pelian's shoulder) and offered to draw blood from me as routine health check-up.  No thank you, Reason.

~ Vortex the Drake was reportedly  responsible for the death of a Secian, Goldenhands.  Witnesses said he continually attacked Townsmen and innocent bystanders, then as the room filled with Spirits, ghosts, and wraiths, he abandoned Goldenhands to his death.  Maybe this is how Vortex vents . . . 

~ Speaking of murder, the governor seems to have hired a bunch of ugly, worthless ninny assassins as his guard.  Otherwise known as Dread Knights.  They've been posted mainly in TSC.  A rather grumpy and swift bunch.  In fact, I was victim to their wrath myself . . . apparently throwing a snowball is against the law and warrant to kill.  After an invasion of assassins, Spurians were defending themselves agains them, only to have a Dread knight start killing the defenders.  Protest anyone?

~ Insprin and his ex-partner have been up to no good lately.  Back to retrieve their orbs, they have gone through trying to kill a lot of people.  Uriah was seen drinking vials of essence to create a protective barrier.  Apparently, Insprin needs the life essence from the orbs or else he will die.  Insprin spent much time trying to entrap Secians into the orbs.  I believe Weldo almost was trapped, and Child volunteered.    Later on, Uriah was betrayed by the Taathian Convert, Dark Mage Insprin.  After trying to threaten a lich, Uriah's tortured screams were heard throughout the Spur.  I believe that was the end of him.  I suspect Insprin will be back soon, to pick up his orbs . . . 
     
~ The one and only Jhered is rumored to be returning soon, in fact I caught a brief glimpse of him running through Spur.  One Spurian stated, "He's different . . . "

Whatever that means . . . Aren't all Sanae different?  Anyone know his plans?

Well, that's all for this issue! Comments, suggestions, complaints, death threats? Leave a scroll for me!

THE TOWN SQUARE DRINKING GAME
By "Lady" Marigold Lyrian


Greetings, all ye merrymakers, ye revelers, ye partygoers, ye who seek the finest and most troublesome in localized Spurian entertainment.  Bear with me for a moment, as I pose a few hypothetical questions.  Have you ever found yourself standing in our fair city's central point of interest (no, blast it, not the Anything Goes Club, the OTHER central point of interest . . . ) with a mug of ale or some other strong spirit in your hand, and nothing to do with it?  Ever just wanted to get thoroughly floored with that new keg of rum and have fun in the process?  Or stay completely sober, only to laugh mercilessly as your friends and family fall for a cheap trick and set themselves up for the most monstrous hangover this side of the Great Divide?  Well, look no further!  I, Marigold (who shall from this point forward will be referred to only as "The Plastered Piper"), have seen your plight.  By means of most ingenious talent and undisguised wit, yours truly has devised the one and only . . . Town Square Drinking Game!

Now, some of you may be asking yourselves at this point, "Just what is the Town Square Drinking Game?"  I'm very glad you asked!  The Town Square Drinking Game is a relatively simple game which can be played by ANYONE!  Yes, anyone.  Whether you choose to imbibe in the stronger stuff or not, you are welcome to participate.  All you need are a Town Square, some people (you can play by yourself if you so desire, but then all the other children will laugh at you), and a hefty supply of your favorite alcoholic beverage.  In the case of hatchlings too young to drink, or prudes-errr, that is to say, those who find alcohol repellent to their tastes, water or some other non-intoxicating drink may be substituted.  It ain't nearly as fun, though.

On to the good stuff!  The following is a quickly compiled list of frequent (and in some cases, not so frequent) events which may take place during a normal (or in some cases, not so normal) day in Town Square.  Each time such an event occurs, all participants will drink the amount prescribed.  The winner is proclaimed when . . . well, OK, there really aren't any winners, it's just an excuse to get drunk.  However, some adventurous souls have been known to drink themselves to death, and consider any remaining survivors the winners of the round . . . Well, you can flesh out the rules yourself, let's get this list going!


Drink (once unless otherwise noted) whenever:

1. Someone is chased screaming from the square by an angry Dragon (twice if it's you.) 

2. A Fir kisses or hugs a San, or vice versa.

3. Someone winces or cringes from a particularly bad musical performance. (one drink for _each person_)

4. More than three stomachs growl in unison.

5. Anyone dies in the square (three times if their ghost yells, "Heal!")

6. Someone is clawed to shreds for picking a pocket.

7. A new citizen asks for help (drink full container if anyone actually helps them.)

8. A lockpick is inadvertently broken (twice if it's Drathain).

9. Anyone is chided and/or bopped over the head for trying to hide in the square. (three drinks if it's Smakem).

10. Any thrown item is inadvertently shattered.

11. Someone verbally or physically accosts an innocent townsman (pushing down, insulting heritage, comparing to a Monitanian, etc.)

12. Any instance of heavy PDA occurs. (group vote) ((merciless taunting if you don't know what PDA is)).

13.   A rodent/skeleton/mugger or other nasty critter enters the square (twice if no one can kill it before it leaves the room.)

14.   Any mention of tokens is made. (two drinks for each Dragon whining to buy them.)

15. Someone vomits (Including yourself- this could definitely become a vicious circle . . . )

Well, there you have it; all I could come up with after the seven-odd tankards of mead which went into the production of this article.  The above list is intended only as a starting point.  If any of you, my dear readers, are actually batty enough to attempt this, feel free to add and amend list items at your own discretion and amusement.  Just remember, I take no responsibility for what may happen to you and yours as a result.
  
 . . . Though, if anything good just miraculously happens, I'll be glad to take the credit.

This is Marigold Lyr-errr, The Plastered Piper, wishing you all a year of happy but responsible partying.  Until next time!
