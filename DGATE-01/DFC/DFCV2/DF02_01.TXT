Greetings!

Welcome, one and all, to the newest issue of the DFC!

To me, this issue signifies the dawning of a new era.  I have proudly and eagerly gone into my work as the new Editor in Chief upon the resignation of Michael, so here's hoping I will be able to achieve the same degree of excellence which he has reached.  I am confident both in my own abilities and those of my staff, as well as those of you who have been constantly faithful in your readings and contributions.  With your help I am sure we will take the DFC to heights never before imagined.

This time around we have all manner of interesting reading material for you.  From revealing Monitanian information, to the words of two of Spur's most talked-about Secians, to the pointless rantings of one of my ever-loving staff members, I believe you will all enjoy what is offered up this month.

You may have noticed the "resetting" of our issue numbering.  As I mentioned above, this reflects the new era we are moving into.  Volume 2 of the DFC has now begun, and soon you will be able to find Volume 1 compiled in the Lore Center.  Other changes are being made as well, as you will see by taking a look at our new DFC News area.

Again, welcome, and thank you all for the warm welcome you have given me.  I am excited about the happenings around here, and I make my promise now- the DFC's future will be bright indeed. Now if only they'd let me change it to the Drag-al Fire Chronicle…

-Marigold Lyrian

Lament
By Reason Valencia

(OOC note: written at 8:42 am EST (8:25 pm Spurian time), when only
five people were in the realms.)

Evening in the Spur, with the sun sinking down, turning buildings to black silhouettes against it.  This is a midnight city.  Stuck smack in the middle of miles and miles of grassland, it just gets too hot during the day; everyone retreats back into their cool houses, leaving Spur silent and empty while they dream.

It's just beginning to cool when I wake up.  Perhaps it won't be much longer before snow paints the grasslands white, nothing to see looking over the walls but an ocean of ice and the Meetpoint towers.  Time for a visit to the AG, for some nice warm furs.  Which just means more hunting, more money to the Artificers'.

A little breeze messes up my already-tangled curls while I lean in the cottage's doorway, trying to finger-comb them straight.  Something hot to drink would be nice, but the guides--wonderful public servants that 
they are--have Spur's entire coffee supply, and don't seem inclined to share, more's the pity.  Barefoot and yawning, letting the cottage door swing shut behind me, I leave the Gilded Lion and set off up Noble Way 
towards TS.

Leaves off the big swaying trees crunch as I step through them.  There's a smoky tang in the air; promising snow, or maybe just left over from the bank fire a few days ago.

The flutter that catches my eye is delicate wings caught by the breeze; two Secians swirl around me, headed for the rogue fields or maybe the Lair.  Their laughter echoes in the empty street; I toss one of them a garnet, underhand, and chuckle when the weight bears her almost to the ground.

A tap at the golden door; just checking, but nobody's home as usual.  Who would waste time sitting at home--no matter how palatial the house--when they could be lazy in TS like normal people?

The wind's picking up, whipping the hem of my tunic back and forth around my knees; and I'm starting to wake up, walking faster.  The haunted house looming off to my right like a rotten tooth...I toss XJS off a snappy, irreverent salute as I pass.  Everyone takes him so seriously--when they remember him at all..

Kicking through the leaves like a kid.  It would be shaping up to be a wonderful day if the city didn't seem so empty.  The air is crisp and smoke-scented, the sun's glare is hidden down away past the horizon; I rub the rounded edge of my Setite amulet and smile.  Young, and content in the service of my God, and plenty of money to call on in the bank besides.  Nothing could ruin my good mood.

Glint of bronze from the shadows is my only warning, before the hammer's blow sends me sprawling in the dry leaves.  Staring up at a hulking mugger; everyone else is asleep, why not them too?  He's eyeing my amulet and getting ready to swing that hammer again.

Bruised and fallen I am, but not exactly beaten.  A soft growl from the shadows heralds my cat's arrival, and its claws dig deep into the mugger's shoulders.  Heat prickles in the palms of my hands as I cast.

When he falls it's with the particular hollow thump of a dead body hitting the ground.  Getting up I dust myself off, give my cat a thankful hug, kick the corpse once out of sheer spite and take his hammer out of sheer avarice.  He doesn't need it anymore, anyway.

Finally the arch is up ahead, antique gold in the fading light.  Smoke spirals up from the charred remains of the bank, off to the right, two battered walls and a pile of blackened bricks.  A quick glance around shows no coins left in the rubble, and I have a little chuckle at the thought of Spur's thieves partying off the largesse of everyone else's bank accounts.

TS, the cobblestones smooth and clean under my bare feet.  Empty.  It's not a nice feeling.  I'm used to lounging  here for hours chatting and meeting people; empty and lonely it gives me a sick lost feeling.  Like Spur's been empty for centuries; and I'm the only one left in the city, a ghost wandering the streets as misguided and angry as the ones in XJS' hallowed halls.

I walk out quickly; the air's getting colder as the day sinks away and I need to get new furs from the AG.  The Merchant's Circle is all brick and polished wood, orderly and neat, with the shops looming over me in a perfect, well-lit circle.  The bazaar up north I can vaguely see, glancing up the avenue that passes under Swords'n'Such (there's an arch built through the building, with a ramp to one side leading up to the shop, can you believe it?  Hithual engineering..); all tattered tents and crudely-built stalls.  A bored bank teller gives me a jovial wink as I catch the bag of gold he tosses.  Back to TS, quickly, the coinpurse jingling in my hand held close in case of thieves--well, the annoying sort of thief who would steal from their clergy.  No worries, 
no one's on the streets.

The buildings up in the guild district are *big*; bigger than the merchants', bigger than the mansions down Noble Way, almost as big as the temples of Odarous and Taath.  Nobody richer than Gods and the guildmasters, of course; they're almost equals in pretentiousness and greed.  

I'm just done ordering my furs from the gruff gnarled Artificer when with a wincing little pain Angelstar's mental voice echoes in my head.  Finally, someone that I know.  I spend the rest of my money up at the Mages' guild, sour-faced old men working the strange device that renews my runes, and hurry back to TS.  Parn and his Chihuahua walk in just as I get there, and I pounce him (and fail to knock him down) just as Angelstar pounces me from out of the shadows (and succeeds, but only because I fell when I tried to down Parn.)  He whines at me and I whine back (because I failed), and Angelstar whines at both of us.

Finally more people are waking up, shaking off their otherworld dreams, hunting or being hunted.  Spur's alive again.

The Links of our Lives
By Rixinon Corinth and Rosi Isor

As the Secians have become a little sullen over the past few months, two Secians, Rixinon and Rosi, decided to put together a script of events that have occurred lately. Some events date back to almost 3 months ago, while some may have happened yesterday. (The Secian community is all but unpredictable =) ) Most of them are slightly exaggerated, while a few are largely exaggerated. The names have been changed, albeit somewhat familiar, to protect the innocent, yadda yadda yadda. Anyhow, it's just a bit of comic relief, and we apologize if you are offended by the content of this story. (To preclude any flame wars, please don't post your complaints and/or whines about the story in the folders, but send them to SN Bood909 (Rosi) and she will forward them to Rixinon. Again, we apologize in advance if this offends you in any way.) Anyhow, we hope you like it, and with feedback, we hope to make LOOL a recurring article in the DFC (feedback should also be sent to Bood909).

And so it begins...

<Spur Park.  This short, circular path curves back upon itself around the trees. The gardeners spend their mornings here, grooming the lush flora so that people can end their day with a quiet stroll along the path, a high point for many residents.  A path is here.>

<Sissi enters from the northeast.>

Stinca:  "Ahh Sissi, I'm glad you could make it."

Sissi:  "What do you want?"

Stinca:  "You're in love with Pukie, correct?"

Sissy:  "Yes.  Why do you ask?"

Stinca:  "Well, I'm in love with Varkid and he's marrying Pukie any moment and...I've got a plan."

Sissi (mumbling):  "That's even worse then 'Nothing can go wrong!'"

Stinca (not hearing Sissi):  "I've thought it out over and over and nothing can go wrong!"

Sissi:  "Oh great."

Stinca (confused):  "What?"

Sissi:  "Nothing."

Sissi (sighing)  "Lets take a walk on the path and discuss your plan."

Stinca:  "Okay."

<Sissi and Stinca begin walking down the path.>

15 minutes later, at the wedding sight of Pukie and Varkid...

<Hill Top, ancient Alter.  Most Secians present.>

Priest:  "We shall begin in just a moment."

<Pukie squirms, she seems nervous and uncomfortable.>

Varkid:  "What's wrong, my love?"

Pukie:  "Nofing much. I'm just a wittwe newvous." <Pukie checks her sun-dial.>

Varkid:  "Nothing to fear, my dea--"

<Sissi and Stinca break in, screaming.>

Sissi (screaming at the top of his voice):  "No, Pukie! I love you! You can't marry this.. this.. THAT!!" <Sissi points at Varkid.>

Stinca:  "And Varkid, I love you! You can't marry... HER! <Stinca point at Cerial> err.. umm.. <Stinca points at Pukie> her!"

<Varkid faints dead away.>

Pukie (to Sissi):  "We need to go talk about this, NOW."

<Varkid awakens and Stinca goes over to comfort him.>

<Sissi and Pukie leave the wedding site, heading for the southlands...>

10 minutes later...

<Sissi and Pukie are walking along the river.>

Sissi (thinking to himself):  "Why did I listen to Stinca?  I've only hurt Pukie and ruined her wedding day."

<Sissi stops walking suddenly, so Pukie stops also.>

Sissi (to Pukie sadly):  "I'm sorry Pukie, this is just wrong.  I should let you be happy if I really love you."

<Sissi takes a few steps and soars 10 feet into the air.  He climbs to 600 feet.>

Pukie (staring up at Sissi with tears in her eyes):  "Oh no Sissi!  Don't!  Please don't!"

<Pukie takes a few steps and soars 10 feet into the air.  She climbs to 600 feet.>

<Up in the clouds, inside a storm.>

Sissi (scared and nervous):  "Goodbye Pukie!"

Pukie (hysterically crying):  "You can't do this to me! I love you!"

Sissi (shaking): "It can't work out, a marriage based on lies won't."

Pukie (confused):  "Lies?  What lies!?"

<Sissi kisses Pukie and closes his eyes getting ready to let himself fall.>

Pukie (screaming):  "If you're going through with this then so am I!"

Sissi (shocked):  "No, you can't!  You have your life ahead of you!"

Pukie:  "I want to be wi--" <lightning strikes Pukie and she falls into the river as Sissi is blown away!>

In Town square...

<Dominating the center of the Town Square is a gate whose 20-foot arch is formed of two grappling dragons. The townsfolk never seem to pass through the gate but walk around it with a sense of awe. Nearby, a group admires the latest hero's statue.>

<You pick up Pukie's mental link, "Sissi and I have plunged to our death.  We love each other dearly, and we could not have this love while alive.">

<Woshi snickers.>

<Ricksonin rolls on the floor laughing.>

Cerial:  "Plink!"

<You pick up Varkid's mental link, "WHAT? PUKIE NOOOOOOO!!">

The raven says, "Varkid will never love again."

<Fork shrieks at the raven>

<Fork swings his diamond-spiked fork at the raven!
  The attack is a deadly blow to the head!
  The raven's head is severed and comes rolling off onto the floor next to you!>

The next day in Town square...

<Varkid and Stinca exchanging vows.>

Jenni (whispering to Cerial):  "I thought you, like, said you were going to, like, clean this place up."

Cerial (whispering to Jenni in a mumble):  "Thats my assistant's job."

Priest:  "I now pronounce you husband and wife, you may kiss the bride."

<Varkid kisses Stinca.>

<Woshi winces.>

Ricksonin:  "What's wrong?"

Woshi:  "I had a vision.. Sissi.. river.. alive..."

Cerial:  "Let's go!"

< Woshi and Ricksonin follow Cerial and they head to the river...>

Jenni (yelling):  "Hey!  Like, wait up."

<Jenni heads for the river.>

Meanwhile...

<Sissi crawls out of the river, dripping wet and a bit shaken.>

Sissi (aloud to himself after thinking for a while):  "Oh my god!  I love Stinca!"

<Sissi stands up and takes a step back, he then he falls down and disappears...>

<Cerial, Woshi, and Ricksonin arrive on the scene.>

Ricksonin:  "No one is here!"

Woshi (sniffing the ground):  "Look A foot print."

Cerial: "Yep, A foot print."

<Jenni arrives, panting.>

Jenni (angry):  "I thought I like, told you to like, wait up!"

Woshi (mocking):  "Well, like, we were like, in a hurry."

<Jenni joins Cerial, Ricksonin, and Woshi.>

<The group heads back to TS, questioning Woshi's vision.>

Meanwhile, in a mysterious cave in Tanga....

<Sissy, drenched with water from the river, squeezes through a crack.>

Sissi:  "Where ARE they? My plan is foiled if I can't find them--"

<Sissi catches a glimpse of a sparklie stone mixed in with some rubble. He picks it up and dusts it off...>

Stone (chanting): "You found the magick wishing stone!  You did what others can't!!  And now my dear young fellow, one wish to you I'll grant!"

<Sissy ponders for a little bit>

Sissi:  "Aha! I wish.. to look like Varkid, talk like Varkid and act like Varkid!"

Stone (chanting):  "A strange decision, yes indeed. To be another is your need?"

Sissi:  "Yes! Yes! DO IT!"

Stone (chanting):  "Okay, okay, your wish is made. But permanent it is not. The wish will fade at half past one, so use the time you've got!!"

<Sissi is suddenly surrounded by an aura of blue.  As the aura fades, you see a dark figure, remarkably identical to Varkid>

Sissi (to the stone):  "Oh, um.. while your at it, could you tell me how to get to TS?"

Stone (chanting):  "Over the river and through the woods, until you see an archway. Through the arch and north a bit, I believe that is the way."

Sissi:  "Thanks."

<Sissi heads off, TS bound.>

Sage's Guild...

<Varkid is sitting in the Sage's guild alone.>

Varkid:  "Dumdee dumdee dummm... (screaming) Woshi! Come here!"

Woshi (screaming from TS):  "What do you WANT?"

Varkid (screaming):  "I need to talk to you. It's very important!!"

<Sissi leaps from the shadows and bops Varkid on the head, knocking him out.  Sissi then rolls him up in a nearby rug.>

<Woshi enters.>

Woshi (annoyed):  "What is it?"

Sissi:  "Oh, um.. thanks for arranging my wedding to Stinca, I really appreciate it."

Woshi:  "You're welcome.  Can I go now?"

<Woshi leaves.>

Sissi:  "Sure."

<Sissi grunts.>

<Sissi drags the rolled up rug that contains Varkid back to the secret cave where he found the magick wishing stone.>

An hour later, in Varkid and Stinca's special spot in Tanga...

Varkid:   "Oh Stinca.  I'm so glad that you and Sissi crashed my wedding to Pukie.  I never really loved her, she was just another sea in the fish.. er.. whatever.  You know, Sissi really is a great guy.  I mean, he practically brought us together, we should throw him a party some time."

<Stinca stares.>

Stinca:  "I don't think he's such a great guy, I mean geeze.. he's got the biggest ego."

Varkid:  "Well, it's really great what he did. I think he's a really nice guy. He's very handsome as well."

Stinca:  "Uhh..."

<Stinca notices a scar on Varkid's upper lip that was never there before.>

<Stinca starts pulling on Varkid's hair!  Varkid's disguise is revealed!  He is really Sissi the male Alaria.. er Secian!>

Stinca (screaming):  "I knew it!  You tricked me, you low down, dirty.. Where's Varkid?!!"

Sissi:  "He's rolled up in a rug at a cave in Tanga with a magick stone that grants wishes."

Stinca (miffed):  "Take me to him!!"

<Stinca pulls out some handcuffs.>

<Sissi shrieks.>

Stinca:  "Simmer down, these are for Varkid!"

<Stinca smiles wickedly.>

<Stinca and Sissi head off to the mysterious cave in Tanga...>

Meanwhile...

<Varkid is struggling to get out of the rug and after about a minute he does.> 

Varkid:  "He thinks he can just roll me up in a rug like some kind of Secian enchilada!  Well, we'll just see about that."

<Varkid notices the magick wishing stone.>

Varkid:  "What's this?"

Stone (chanting):  "You found the magick wishing stone!  You did what others can't!  Hurry up and make a wish, I'm tired of this chant."

<Varkid blinks in amazement.>

Varkid:  "Any wish?"

Stone (chanting):  "Yes, yes, any wish.  Now do it fast or you'll be a fish."

Varkid:  "Okay, um..  I no longer want to be Varkid!  I want to be a different person, FOREVER."

Stone (chanting):  "Forever! That's very, very long. You may want to think, this may be wrong."

<You pick up Stinca's mental link, "Varkid, I'm coming for you!">

Varkid (yelling in a chant):  "No!  No!  Do it now!  Give me a potion or tell me how!  Ack, now I'm talking like you!"

Stone (chanting): "Fine, fine, as you wish, though I think you'd be better as a fish.  I have no control on what you'll be but I'm aiming for a Secie.  Now drink from this vile with a big happy smile!'

<A black stained vile appears, Varkid picks it up and drinks from it with a small smile.  Varkid chokes as a murky black aura surrounds him and he disappears.>

<The stone suddenly shatters into millions of pieces.>

<Stinca and Sissi enter.>

Sissi:  "Uh-oh!  He's not here!"

Stinca (staring at Sissi):  "I thought you said he was."

Sissi (pointing at the rug):  "I rolled him up in that, he must have escaped.  <Sissi notices the shattered pieces of the magick wishing stone>  Oh no!  He found my stone and made a wish!"

Stinca:  "So?"

Sissi:   "So, it was a powerful wish because the stone is shattered!"

Stinca:  "Yeah, so what!"

Sissi:  "He could have --"

<You pick up Sippy's mental link, "I am evil!  I am chaos!  I am power!  I AM SAPPY!>

<You pick up Sippy's mental link, "No, wait.  I am evil!  I am chaos!  I am power!  I AM SIPPY!>

Stinca:  "I see what you mean!  Let's go!"

<You pick up Cerial's mental link, "I am Cerial.">

<You pick up Sippy's mental link, "Can anyone help me find the volcano in Tanga?">

<Silence over the link.>

<You pick up Sippy's mental link, "Can anyone help me find the volcano in Tanga?">

<Silence over the link.>

<You pick up Sippy's mental link, "Can anyone help me find the volcano in Tanga?">

<You pick up Woshi's mental link, "I don't think anyone knows.">

<You pick up Sippy's mental link, "Can anyone help me find the volcano in Tanga?">

<Silence.>

<You pick up Sippy's mental link, "Okay then!  Until someone helps me, I'm going to kill every peaceful animal I see!  Oh look, there goes a stallion!!  HAHA!!>

<Woshi races to Tanga and searches for the disturbing un-Secian.>

<Woshi is looking for Sippy near Elindale's shrine and shrieks as she sees the lifeless bodies of a rabbit, stallion, and dove.>

Woshi (screaming):  "Sippy!!!"

Sippy (screaming):  "You'll never find me!! HAHA!!"

<Woshi moves southwest and finds Sippy tormenting a stallion.>

<Woshi pushes Sippy down!
Sippy stumbles and falls down!>

Sippy (muttering):  "Darn, you're PvP immune."

<Woshi laughs.>

<You pick up Woshi's mental link, "Ricksonin, Cerial, Jenni!! Come HELP me with this weirdo!>

<Sippy stands up and soars 10 feet into the air!>

<Woshi soars ten feet into the air and pushes Sippy down.>

Woshi:  "You're not going anywhere until I get help."

<Ricksonin, Cerial, and Jenni arrive from the southwest.>

<Sippy shrieks and stands up, then flies 10 feet into the air.  He keeps flying up and up, using his slightly puny spells to invigorate him.>

Jenni:  "Whoa, it's like completely humid out here!  My hair is getting frizzy, and.. (she whines) if you fall and go splat all over my new dress, I'll be, like so totally buggin', it's like not even funny."

<Just then, Stinca and Sissy arrive.  Sippy stares at them.>

Sippy:  "You betrayed me, Stinca!!  You betrayed me, and now I perish!  I will use my last bit of fatigue to.. to.."

<Sippy points at Jenni.>

Sippy:  "I'm taking that frog with me!!"

Sippy:  "Err..."

<Sippy points at a nearby frog.>

Jenni (upset at her appearance):  "Hey!!  You watch what you call me!"

<Some runes dance above Sippy and fly toward the frog.  A fire eagle slashes at it, and as the frog's life slips away, it seems to twist and turn, as the small spirit of a Secian emerges from it.>

Sippy:  "P.. Pokey.. Pip.. Pukie!!" 

<As Sippy plummets from 500 feet in the sky, you hear,   "PUUUUUUUKKKKKKIIIIIIIIIEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!>

<As Sippy's bones crush, runes gathering above Jenni fly toward Sippy's lifeless body. His life is restored, but the aura will only last so long.>

Ricksonin:  "Cerial! Woshi! Jenni! Help me drag Sippy to TS! We only have a few minutes! HURRY!!"

Jenni:  "Eww.. I don't want to touch it!"

<Cerial gets out her mop and mops up all the gross stuff.>

Cerial:  "Next time this happens, JENNI has mop duty!"

<Ricksonin, Woshi, Jenni, and Cerial drag Sippy's almost-lifeless body to TS.>

Stinca:  "I wonder who that whacko was? I mean, I've betrayed a lot of people in my life, but.. I've never even MET him!"

Sissi:  "Think it could have been Vark--"

Stinca:  "Be quiet.  Don't remind me of him... and NO, he wouldn't do something THAT stupid."

<Stinca and Sissi head off to TS, bickering all the way.>

5 minutes later in Town square...

<Ricksonin, Woshi, Jenni, and Cerial enter from the southeast dragging Sippy's almost-lifeless body.>

<Stinca and Sissi enter from the southeast.>

<Sippy regains consciousness.>

Sippy (faintly):  "Puuuuuuuuukie."

<Sippy just lost consciousness!>

Crayonsten (blinks and then shrieks): "Oh my Odie!  What happened to him?!"

Woshi (screaming):  "We're losing him!"

<In Sippy's head he hears Pukie's voice, "Sippy!  Sippy!  You can't die yet, they need your turkey recipe!  Errr, (Pukie yells out to 'someone' and then she yells "Oh.")  "WE need the turkey recipe so come on over!">

<Cerial puts her hands upon Sippy's chest.>

Cerial (in a trance):  "Beep."

Cerial (in a trance):  "Beep."

Cerial (in a trance):  "Beep."

Cerial (in a trance):  "Beep."

Cerial (in a trance):  "Beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep!"

<You see Cerial is in a trance.>
<You see Woshi with a horrified look.>
<You see Ricksonin with a horrified look.>
<You see Stinca is thinking to herself, "Oh just die already.">
<You see Sissi with a dumbfounded look.>
<You see Jenni is babbling about her hair and restore life aura.>
<You see Crayonsten is inhaling boxes of crayons.>

WILL Sippy recover? WILL Stinca fall in love with Sissi as he has fallen in love with her? WILL Jenni get those nasty stains out of her new dress? Who knows... 

Rosi and Rixie (in unison) : We know! <cackle>

Society Column
By Esper Esperchan (AKA lard boy)

Welcome back, faithful readers, for another digest of the bardic recitals, and other events of the Social Elite (Heh).

I've been getting my act together as far as the paperwork is concerned, especially since I've been receiving bricks thrown through my windows by an anonymous Lord Edi-tor dragon about my previous practices. He cringes whenever I say "Autoscribe." So, if you want to see all the Bardic Antics, you'll have to see for yourself! 

(Fridays at 8:30 EST, Bardic Stage in the associated guilds)

Here are the winning entries for Spur of the Moment, as well as Prepared Entries.


Untitled, By Maire. (Prepared winner)


Lightning flash strike to the quick of the heart
Suddenly silence-- a loss now unbound
An instant entwined, forever apart
Wetly life rushes back into the ground

Echoing sorrow resounds in the soul
So vast a void, deeply numbing it rends
Jagged and jarring, a great gaping hole
Shockingly pointless, no chance for amends

Travesty, trying, an act so unfair
With tasks incomplete and words left unsaid
Survivors, alone, in Pity's cold care
No jury, no judge, no case to be plead

Madness engulfing, the depths to descend
Apathy lording, curse gods! Does it end?!


Very nice, Maire. And Marigold won the Spur of the Moment competition, which was  about "Elders." Well, you try thinking up something better. Hrrumph.


The ones we know as Elders,
Are strange and wondrous beasts;
They always seem to pop up,
When we expect them least.

Marigold ducks.

They come from out of nowhere,
Though their entrances are grand;
They step out of the shadows,
Or rise from whirling sands.

And when they finally get here,
Oh, the wonders they perform-
Creating objects from thin air,
Or removing Town Square's floor.

So few know how they do it,
But they do it, all the same,
As if, for these mythic beings,
Godly deeds are just...a game.

But begrudge them not their skillfulness,
For what they have is just;
They use their powers wisely,
And they're watching over us.

Very good, Marigold. I'm sure you deserve that prize. ^_^

Armonius and Panick's Luau:
As I'm not completely sure of the events, I'll just let the original announcement speak for itself.

A long overdue celebration in honor of their joyous union in marriage will be hosted by Armonius and Panick Undermount. All Spurians are invited to join us at a Luau to be held in the Tanga Palm Grove at 8:30 PM on Saturday 1 November. There will be food, drink, dancing, and music appropriate for the occasion and some special tiki torches will deter the normal denizens of Tanga from crashing the party.
Please tell all your friends and join us at what should be the social event of the year. Start practicing for the hula contest right away!

Hmm, it will deter the normal denizens of Tanga from crashing it, but not normal people. Or should I say, Normal Drag-Als. Hmmhmm. ^_^**

Announcement:

This is just something I'd like to say to everyone who has been thanking me profusely for my work on resurrecting the recitals.

Choose a job you love, and you'll never have to work a day in your life.  
--Confucius

It's so hard...
So hard to smile
When you're not happy,
When you can't see the light;
It's so hard...
Too hard to fight.

It's so hard...
So hard to laugh
When inside you're crying,
When inside you can't let go;
It's so hard...
Too hard for you to know.

When you're overcome
With feelings of loss,
The memories fall;
They rip at your heart,
They tear at your mind,
All your feelings of love
Are soon left behind.

It's so hard...
So hard to remember
When you can't bear the memories
When your heart can't take the pain;
It's so hard...
When you find your love was in vain.

And you try,
You try,
You TRY.

And you cry,
You cry,
You CRY.

It's so hard...
So hard to piece together
When the pieces are scattered,
Your memories shattered,
Your love was in vain,
Oh gods, the pain...
It's so hard.

Bronze (a serial)
By Rhea Romero

Lobb didn't like the looks of it one bit.  Too many people.  Too much color.  Silky things.  Lobb liked green and brown and not much else.  And leather, leather's good.  Lots of tall people.

Lobb walked nonchalantly through the square.  A tall person looked down at him and smiled.  "Hi!" she said warmly.  "You new?"

He raised an eyebrow and looked up at her.  Said nothing.

She laughed and hugged him.  She had sparkly blonde hair and a long face.  Her ears were pointed.  Elf, Lobb thought.  She wore a soft blue dress.  It looked expensive.  "I'm Inzy," she said.  "Need some help getting around?"

Lobb considered the situation.  He had an agenda.  Would this Elf get in the way?  Could she be helpful?  She was looking at him expectantly.  He decided to see what she could do for him.  "Which way's the bank," he said flatly.

Inzy smiled.  "The bank in Town Square burned down.  I can take you to the one in Market Circle, though.  Follow me!"  He did.  They walked in silence a while.  Inzy looked nervous.  "Do you know how the bank works?" she asked.  

Lobb looked at her.  "I've been in banks."  She smiled.

"Of course.  Sorry."  They were silent again.  Lobb memorized his surroundings.  Inzy seemed to be the type who craved noise, because she started again.  "So, did you come from the Training Grounds?  You look skilled."  Lobb chuckled softly.  Girl couldn't know.  

"Yeah.  I'm skilled."  In pretty much every combative skill there was.  Lobb had patience above and beyond that of even a normal Hithual, which is nothing to sneeze at.  Patience is a good virtue.  Patience would help him in what was to come.  And wariness.  Generous, helpful, young girl...  what was she doing in that clearly custom-ordered dress?

They had reached the outside of Market Circle.  "Here it is," Inzy said, pointing to an arch.   Lobb nodded.  He noticed a few muggers lurking in the shadows, but a subtle flash of his medallion sent them scampering off obediently.  Nonetheless, he felt (much to his surprise) light fingers penetrate his coinpurse.  He had whirled to slaughter the fiend when he saw (much to his GREAT surprise) it was Inzy.

She saw him stare at her and took advantage of the moment to desperately jab out with a well-concealed dagger.  Lobb flinched back and the blade caught his arm.  Cursing the girl, the dwarf pulled out his black battle-axe and raised it theatrically.

Seeing herself overpowered, Inzy turned to run, but Lobb grabbed her arm and pulled her back.  Not so fast.  He lifted the axe over her neck and let it hover.  He saw the girl sigh and murmur an apology to Set for failing him here.

"Elf."  It was the first word he had spoken the whole time.  She looked up at him with a deeply betrayed look on her face.  "Either I kill you or you help me.  Your choice."

Inzy raised an eyebrow and blinked.  "Help you what?"

"On my mission.  The details are sketchy yet."

Inzy chewed her lip and seemed to ponder this proposition.  "Um, okay," she said.  "Sounds intriguing.  And by the way," she added as Lobb let her up.  "I'm not just an ELF.  I'm an Usilin.  Remember that."  She peered at him.

"Fine.  I call you Usilin and you don't pick me.  Deal."

Inzy shook her head wonderingly.  "Sure, deal!"

Entropy: A Fresh View
By Anzarn

To appreciate this document, ye must comply with a few simple requirements.  First, abandon anything ye 
believe ye know about the subject.  Second, be open to the possibility that the other two possibilities with regard to alignment are not, as some have said, absolutes.  This scroll will be written from the perspective of a Dragon, such as I am, and I will not presume to tell ye that there will be no bias within it; however, I have endeavored to provide a fresh insight into this subject, which has eluded many for a very long time.

It is true that, by definition, Entropy is the ‘middle ground' between Chaos and Order.  It is much more, however, to those of us who have taken the time to ponder it.  Consider the actions of many of those whom ye may have come to know in the Spur, and ye will likely run across at least a few who revel in the thought of stealing someone else's goods or simply ending the life of another for the pleasure of it.  These individuals, more often than not, are Chaotic, while those who would rather limit their experiences to the healing of others or helping others as an outlet for their energies would tend to be Orderly.  This, though, hardly scratches the surface, for there is another choice in our midst.  Those who embrace the concept of Entropy do not disavow the existence of Chaos and Order in these realms, but rather, concede that they both have equal and opposite influence on the actions of others.

In general, those who hold Entropy to be their alignment tend to be more solitary, more controlled, than others.  The reason is simple: they hold both Chaos and Order as the solitary tenets on which the existence of all else is based.  Indeed, there is a different view for those who look at such things as alignment from a slightly aloof standpoint.  Chaos, in all its forms, is natural.  Nature is Chaos.  Life is Chaos.  All things were brought into existence through the exercise of Chaos as a force in and of itself.  Life is a random, skewed show, moving in tandem with the actions of other individuals, and nothing can be done to change that.  Order, on the other side of the spectrum, is a theory conceived by those who were wise enough to realize that Chaos would eventually degenerate into anarchy, regardless of the civility of those who might administer it.  It is more of a well-devised creation of massive importance, a true example of the power of the mind.  Indeed, the planning and executing of ideas, the organization of a guild, the economic survival of all Spur rely on those who embrace Order.  Entropy is the belief that these forces counteract each other, checking and balancing the power of magick, life, and death in a grand, cosmic display.

I realize that by now those of ye who hold Chaos or Order most dear are thinking to yourselves that I must be drowning in ale to come to such a conclusion.  Furthermore, ye may have stopped reading much earlier... but understand this -- without Order, Chaos would be irrelevant, and vice versa.  The conflict between the forces which binds our world is what makes it what it is, just as the conflict between ourselves is what determines who we are.  The most important part of Entropy is its passivity, however, and not conflict.  Entropic individuals, by nature, have little interest in fighting, save for very few.  The tenets of Entropy are that Chaos and Order relate to each other in all things, large and small, but do not require the assistance of others to prosper or fail.  Should someone attempt to ‘enforce' Entropic behavior, they would be failing to practice it themselves, as they would be advocating one side over the other.  There would be little difference between that and trying to exterminate Clerics of all orders, until only an equal number of Taathians who can smite and clerics who might resurrect are left, in an attempt to ‘balance' power in an odd manner.

In any case, I have rambled enough, and this is far enough to express my thoughts.  I ask ye not to accept what I have written here, but rather simply to retain it for thought... it may save ye one day.

More Than Eight?
By Frason Dranco

Ah, walking through the streets of Spur (soon to be re-named Leuiana Colony after those Khats finally admit they're large numbers are an invasion force and NOT an act of over-excited breeding) we see the typical array of peoples milling about there daily lives. A great wing of Dragons, the litter or Khats, a boat full of Secians, and the gracious helping of Hiths to help matters. Add a little Anthian for spice (spice of life, they get a little picky when the gnaw on there leg-bones), and a good amount of Psycians for seasoning. Spiders and SANs make a good chaotic piece as well.

So, there are 8 races in Spur, of course. Well, of course that's what everyone thinks walking through a busy Town Square. Well, in this investigative report, we are here to tell you otherwise! 

We have traveled far and wide to try and find out, where the Lost Races currently are today. Each of the Lost Races are featured in alphabetical order, as to avoid hostility (for all we know they might have wiped each other out).

Also, as a disclaimer, this is poking at various races and as to why they are not around Spur. No offense is intended to any of the few people from these select breeds that HAVE tried to integrate into our society.

DRAG-AL: These creatures, originally found in a lost Dragon Colony, have gone back to said lost colony. All attempts to interview any leader has failed because we got lost going to the colony. Though there are a few Drag-als currently making a living in the Spurian area, mainly using there Fire Breathing as a public service to roast small finger-sandwiches.

ELVES (FIR AND USIL): These two races are evolutionary dead-ends of the popular San Elf. Both have found mass integration into Spurian life to much of a hassle. For the Fir Elves, it came after a failed petition to save at lest some of the trees before they came falling down to construct Noble Way. For the Usil, rumor points towards a vengeful, smiteful god locking them all up somewhere in the local Sages Guild.

FLERIANS: In times past these peoples were once sat as a Major Race of there own, but after the failed ascendancy of the Flerian Kingdom (reports we have received indicate fiscal problems due to people forgetting to bolt down anything in the treasury) has left the few remaining Flerians scattered. There are reports that another royal family is trying to emerge from the ruins, right here in the Spurian area, but actual fact remains to be seen.

FRONTACIANS: Frontacian culture has been on a decline in the Spurian area as seemingly a direct result of the Psycian culture sky-rocketing (gee, I wonder if that's some how related...). While they are still massive in numbers, and as ego filled as when they're empire reigned high, they seem to mainly avoid this area out of free will. 

GOBLIN/GOBLIN-AL: Both races seem to be in short supply all around the globe. It is unknown why. In fact, it is unknown why they are even around Spur. Heck, we aren't even sure why they're around at all. Short, slightly slobbery, and without a formal grasp of common, most Goblin(-als) live in constant fears of being killed as either a result of an alleged theft, or just a meanie. We here would like to give our admiration (using the term loosely) to these people of these races, brave enough to survive in these times (and we thank the gods every day we're not in your shoes).

HUMANS/ELDERS: Rare creatures from the Elderian area, these rare peoples are part of an strange culture. Granted powers from some unknown source (though rumor has pointed us towards Moe, the janitor over in the Mages Guild) the otherwise mundane human turns into what we know as the Elder. Current studies are inconclusive if this change from Human to Elder has any biological effects, or if the racial trait is survivalist only, or can be carried on through offspring. It is believed Humans are rare because they fear the evil Moe. It is said that the Elder is rare because few are willing to take that step, or the inability to breed into a different race due to a purely survivalist system after the "Moe Factor".

MONITANIANS: Another "There gone but why?" case. While they have no ability to speak common, that doesn't seem to stop them (millions of silver have been funneled into the Sages Guild to find out why we all seem to know sign language at birth). Strong, yet slightly dull, they seem to be an roll model for most Spurians. Though, as said, for some reason there numbers dwindle.

OOG-RA: Less intelligent then bricks, barely sentient, and mental outlook changes from violence to drooling with the seasons. Now, why exactly do you need a reason?

PENTHANIANS: Giant Gems. Rumors point that this is the reason that the main Penthanian culture went under-ground, is due to the fact that 2 to 3 Penthanians are currently on display at the gem store. There has been freak surges in the population now and again, but mostly they tend to stay in there "Secret Underground City"...where is this city? Well, it's a secret.

THUGIANS: A plus above the Oog-ra 'culture' by, instead of being less intelligent as bricks, they are as intelligent AS bricks. None the less, various tribes have been seen among the world. One is said to be in the local Spurian area, giving us our limited gene-pool. Also a strange trend of Thugian Mages (In most civilized areas this is considered a oxymoron) has gone from "As rare as seeing Taath in a pink dress dancing and planting flowers." to "Slightly Common."

Agent of S.A.N. mission 135
By Aubrei RHRashakae

My new mission, I had just learned, was to get all of the real Sans to get along. It would prove to be a difficult journey, one that I wasn't sure I was ready for. But I tired of Rogues, and decided to take the assignment. Of course, Commissioner Shortly scares me, I didn't have much of a choice. Here is the story of my journey, and the events leading to it.
I was hunting in the Rogue Fields, as normal, minding my own business, when Kagee and Kbar walked in, and beat the Rinnani following San elf that was busy trying to heal himself. Now, Kbar isn't much (Author's note: Joke, please don't kill me) but Kagee is a real beast when she wants to be.  All in all, this San didn't have a chance of surviving. I would have intervened, but, um, I was tying my boot, and didn't have a chance. ::cough:: 
Anyways, as I continued my hunt, I noticed them doing this repeatedly, to Firs as well as the Entropic Sans.  Now, as an Entropic S.A.N., I was slightly worried, but I figured my Khat-like speed and Agility, as well as my quicker than lightning Pray Sanctuary would keep me out of trouble. I hid in the shadows, and when they came in, learned of their plans.  They were going to rid the world of the so called Pathetic Firs and Usils. ( I noticed they had done a remarkable job getting rid of the Usils).  They also considered any but Chaotic Sans to be a waste of air.  As I was about to attempt my first level stealth out of the room, I was transported to central Agent of S.A.N. headquarters. Commissioner
Shortly, never one to waste words, said " You have seen the problem, these Sans must be shown the light of happiness." "But how" I asked " How can I make them happy?"  " That is for you to decide" she said " But once again, I beg of you, take this" Raising an eyebrow, I accepted what she handed me. " Oh, a breath mint, another bloody breath mint" She smiled knowingly and sent me back.
Unfortunately, Shortly has a slight depth perception problem.  I ended up exactly where I was, just 2 miles up.  I fell for about 3 minutes, remembering right before I hit that I had wings. My last conscious thought for quite some time went like this " Oh, right I can fl..." 
That's when the darkness came, and boy was there ever a lot of it.  When I awoke, Kbar and Kagee were standing over me.  They thanked me and left.  I wondered about this for a while, then began to climb out of my hole. Either because of 1. My terrible climbing ability, 2. My lack of strength, or 3. My forgetting of my wings again, I took about 3 days to get out of the hole.  Noticing that I had forgotten my medallion, I reached into the 5 inch divot and got it.  I noticed a small brown spot at the bottom of the hole, looking down, I realized it was a Usil, or what was left of it. Unfortunately, it broke my fall with it's head.  Mumbling to myself how I had known for years that they had some purpose, I hobbled along in the direction Kbar and Kagee had gone.  I didn't think I was hurt, so I looked down at my legs, wondering why I was hobbling unnecessarily.  I discovered that my progress was being impeded by a small point eared creature, clinging earnestly to my leg.  I searched my memory for a name for it, and narrowed it down to between oliphant and Fir elf.  " ?tnahpilo na ouy erA" I asked in Oliphantian. After he looked at me like I had somewhere between forty two and forty three heads, I decided he must be a Fir elf. 
Just to be sure, I reminded myself not to tell any Oliphant jokes, at least not the vulgar ones.  During my long, suffering trip, following the bodies of elves, I learned that the Fir Elf's name was Yulin.  He dislodged himself when I reached TS central, going to hide next to the pit of ash we called the 1st National Bank of Spur.  While chatting with Michael about what to do next, Kbar ran through, dragging some San elf like a rag doll.  I excused myself politely, wiped the gingerbread drag-al off my mouth, and fly after him. 
Believing I'd lost him, I began to go back, when I noticed something gleaming in the
noon sun.  I descended and picked it up.  Once again searching my memory, I decided it was either an oliphant tusk or a Usil elf tooth.  Before I could ask it anything in Oliphant, Kbar came back. " Have you seen a Usil tooth?" He asked. " Um, you're bleeding" I said, pointing at the blood covering his face and hands. " No problem" he said " It's not mine".  Knowing this might be my only chance, I said " Sure here it is" and reached towards my pocket. While he was distracted, I gave him the big one. My smile was so wide it hurt. Luckily, my aim was pristine, and the sun reflected off my big white ones right into his eyes.  "Ahhh" he screamed " I'm gonna tar and feather you!!" After an awkward silence he said " Well, I'm gonna tar you". Wrapping his still blind body in my Agent of S.A.N. Trenchcoat, I picked him up and carried him to the newly refurbished S.A.N. headquarters.  Realizing that I didn't have any bonds strong enough to hold him, I called Jimbo, who promptly sat on him, waving that bright red N.U.K.E. button in his face.  As his sight returned, I asked him " Why do you have to kill all of those poor elves, just because they're different than you?" He replied " It's fun" " But why can't you be happy?" I pleaded. " That makes me happy" he said, "Beating them senseless is fun." Stunned, I sat down heavily.  I heard a voice behind me, speaking from the shadows.  " Now you understand, " the Commissioner said " happiness is different for everyone, and different things make people smile". " But I've failed" I whined, fearing a life of Turnip farming ( it's in the charter).  " No, you haven't" she said " watch and learn" Turning back to Kbar, I
noticed that he was holding the Usil tooth in him hand, chuckling silently to himself. As he became aware that he was being watched, his faced resumed the stoic appreciation of the world we all know and fear.  I smiled, finally understanding.  Mission complete.    


As an added bonus, as Kagee came to pick up Kbar at the headquarters, Jimbo Nuked the muscles that allow them to frown, just to be sure...

A Thief's Journey To Spur
By Araton Cutpurse

The icy wind howled around me. I knew I should have hidden in town and left in the spring or summer. It was too late to turn back, though. Already patrols were on my trail, hounding my footsteps. I thought about the events that had happened. I had killed my uncle, Kriquex. Not out of cold blood, however. He had hurt the closest thing to me like a mother. Not to say I didn't have a mother. I did. But she sent me away because I was a tarr'khat and thief. Sometimes I wonder if I would have liked Khaxen's way better. His was to kill me. Anyways, Kriquex had brought three women home after being absent for three months. Kitten, the only one who cared for Kriquex, was devastated. How could Kriquex do this? Kitten took care of me, and had never harmed a soul. So I murdered Kriquex in his sleep. I was blamed for the dagger in his throat when he was found the next morning. I was out of town, though, and had left a note for Kitten already. I slowly came back to the present. The police were already after me. I could stay in Leuia for a short time, but must leave soon. I thought to Khaxen. Maybe I could get him for all the things that he did to me simply because I chose the way of a thief. I smiled in the icy winter air. Yes, that's what I would do. At dawn, I retraced my steps (no easy thing with patrols looking for me) and headed back on a little known route to Leuia. I went through the sewers. Kriquex had always said a good thief used the paths of thieves. From here I could access nearly any part of Leuia. Unfortunately, it took me a week to get where I wanted to go. The patrol has lost me by now, I mused. I looked around and found a ladder I was searching for. It let to the streets near my former home. I took a breath, and started climbing..... The smell of fresh air was good. I wandered around for a few moments, ducked into the shadows, and went off to Khaxen's cottage; wait, no, my cottage. I entered through the window, and went to the well, clutching a bag. I opened the bag, and squeezed on a bright red berry, over the well. Silverthorn poison. After repeating this process a few times, I was satisfied the well was poisoned. I dropped the bag in the shadows, knowing that no one would find it until it was too late. It was the antidote to the poison. After all, I only wanted Khaxen to take a sip and die, and not the rest of my family. Tygraa would surely investigate, find the antidote, and de-poison the well, after Khaxen's death. I left the way I'd came, and went back into the blackness of the sewers.... With Set guiding me, and a crude map I'd made on the coming, I managed to find my way out of the sewers easier than it had been to get to the cottage. I went as far as the sewers would go before leaving, though, and that took a few day's delay to stumble through the endless tunnels and away from wererats, assassins, master thieves, and the like. But I made my way out. It was a few miles from Leuia, and I started towards the forest, whistling a traveling song. The docks were a few miles away from the forest, so I'd have enough cover for the journey there. The brush was thicker than I'd thought, I muttered grimly, hacking through vines and bushes. I'd gotten to the forest uneventfully, but getting through it was another matter. Wild animals of all kinds were prowling around. More than once I'd woken in my sleep only to find a wild animal over me, ready to kill, before I quickly got a dagger out and thrust it into the animal's stomach. One of these days, I reflected, I wouldn't wake up soon enough. After a few more hours of hacking and slashing, I came to the edge of the forest, and the start of the docks. Ships of all kinds were around me, and there was a wide variety of places to go. I chose a ship called Starbeam, which was heading in the direction of a city called Spur. I decided it was a good idea, and paid for my passage. (Yes, I actually paid for something.) Here is where I met Janae, but I'll leave those details out.... but the trip was eventful nonetheless. By the 2nd day on board, people figured out who I was...I had to 
kill them. One mage I pushed overboard, and a sailor I poisoned. They never managed to tell the captain who I was. A fortnight later, we arrived near Spur. I left Starbeam, and wandered around for a while. After pickpocketing a few nobles, I decided the picking in Spur would be good. I walked on the open plains of Darkith, and two hours later, the large gates of Spur greeted me.....

Interview With A Warlord
By Chiriga Zenphiir


It starts in pitch black night-time with a little scraping noise; chitinous and dry; and the creaking of a door opening, and the harsh stone-on-stone of a flint being struck.  Gold firelight gleams in the room, a simple little tavern room in Meetpoint.  A short coal-black Arachnian is scuttling around, lighting candles, with a scroll of dirty vellum and a tattered red silk bag in one hand, and a cheap ravens-quill pen stuck behind her ear, dripping ink into her hair.

Out of the crimson bag comes polished bone; a squarish, huge, strong-jawed skull with the lowered brow and flattened nose of the troll race.  The Arachnian climbs up into a chair, setting the skull on the big table before her surrounded by a half-circle of dingy beeswax candles.  From the shadows a cave troll lumbers in; massive, glowering, dressed in a filthy linen uniform.

Chiriga unrolls the dirty vellum and readies her pen.  A bitter sigh comes from above, and her raven with its tiny gold collar flies from the rafters to land clumsily on her shoulder.

"Your lordship," Chiriga says reverently, and salutes the troll-skull with her pen.  "I've brought you for the interview as you requested."

The cave troll speaks in a slurred deep bass voice.  "Lord Bey is pleased."

Chiri leans forward and touches a burning taper to the gnarled candlestub inside the troll-skull's jaw.  It flames to life and gold light flickers in the empty eyesockets.

The raven, dusty and hungry-looking, makes some soft derisive noise, and Chiri clicks her mandibles at it with mild irritation.

"Your name would be a good place to start, Lord,"  she murmurs, shifting restlessly in the chair.

The cave troll grunts, a sound like boulders rubbing up against each other.  "He is the Warlord Papa Friedlander Bey.  Most call him Lord Bey; only you as his shieldmaiden have the right to call him Papa."

Chiriga preens.  "How did you gain, such a magnificent title, my Lord?"  

The raven snorts disbelievingly.

"The Lord Bey was once the leader of a vast underground troll society; they referred to him as Papa."  The cave troll looks almost patriotic for a moment.
"It was later, in Moldavia, that he gained the title of Warlord."

Chiriga blinks, startled.  Ink is beginning to smear her fingers from the cheap quill.  "Moldavia, the homeland of the Muatana-al?"

The raven shrieks and explodes from its perch at the mention of the lethal Muats, fluttering nervously in midair before settling back onto Chiriga's shoulder.

The cave troll glares at the dusty bird and continues.  "Lord Bey lived among the Muat for many years.  Some even came to...revere him.  He would be there yet, commanding in his glory, had not a pack of whining, traitorous royals thrown him from his rightful seat of honor."

The raven squawks and in a whiny voice calls out, "I hear you walked through Moldavia's gates proclaiming yourself Lord and they tossed your skull out five minutes later!"

The cave troll growls ominously as the polished skull flickers wildly.

The raven shifts back and forth on its perch and mumbles something about uppity, incomplete skeletal matter.

The cave troll grumbles and continues its litany.  "Exiled--"

"Dead as doornails!" The raven shrieks, rocking back and forth on its perch with manic glee.  It barely dodges the stream of webbing Chiriga tosses its way and flutters nervously in midair, whining.

"EXILED," the cave troll says loudly, "Exiled and scorned no less, his Lordship wandered many years until you, Chiriga, stumbled across him.  One day word will come from his Lordship's faithful servants in Moldavia, and we shall follow him to battle--to his birthright!"

Chiriga wipes away a patriotic tear and coughs.  "What about the Chaos Lords?  Do they figure into your glorious Plans?"

The cave troll looks blank for a moment and leans over the table, pressing its face close to the skull.  Sizzling is heard as the candles scorch the troll's hair.
Finally, smoldering, it straightens up again.  "The who?"

Chiriga looks blank for a moment, and shrugs.  "Eh..never mind. Next question."  

The cave troll stands firmly, smoke rising from its matted, scorched hair.

Rubbing gently at the circular scar on her forehead, Chiriga asks, "What about the temple of Taath right here in Spur?  Do you hope to have Taath's aid in your quest?"

The troll-skull flickers mildly.

"Taath is a mighty god," the cave troll says slowly, "But his followers in Spur are too disorganized and impetuous to be of use.  No offense to you, Chiriga.  I have considered offering them my services as a stabilizing influence, but they may be too involved in their random violence to heed me."

Chiriga grumbles and nods.  "Thinking back to a few meetings I've attended, you may be right."

The raven, lighting on Chiriga's shoulder again, squawks something about Spoon trying to use the troll-skull as an ale-mug; she shoos it back into the rafters. "Are there any Spurians you might hope to recruit?"  She asks, settling back into her chair.

"A few, " the cave troll asserts.  "There are those here with a modicum of potential, although few have discipline, and must learn to treat a Warlord--even a Warlord in exile--with more respect.."

From its safe spot in the rafters, the raven squawks, "He's still got dents from Jhered's little kick-ball stunt!"

Chiriga growls, losing patience, and before the scraggly bird has time to do more than shriek it is entangled in webbing, stuck firmly to its rafter.  Chiriga nods with satisfaction and turns back to the table.  "Do you have any short-term goals or plans?  Anything the Spurian public should know about?"

The cave troll stands at parade attention and tries to look official.  "The Lord Papa Bey has no comment at this time, although he will say that he has not been completely idle.  Good help such as yourself can be hard to find."

Chiriga nods and grumbles something about incompetent spies who can't even sneak onto a dinky little fishing scow...

"Any advice for the people of Spur before we end the interview, my Lord?"

Leaning close again to the skull, the cave troll murmurs something in its gravelly voice.  Seconds pass as its hair flames brightly.

"Beware the one-fanged Muat!"  The huge troll states, smoke and flames dying on its skin.  Chiriga winces.  

"As you wish, my Lord.  This interview is concluded."

Standing, almost falling from the chair before all her legs are firmly on the floor, Chiriga tries to roll up the dirty vellum scroll and curses as ink smears across the paper.  A minor commotion at the door ends in a pale, thin, battered-looking Usilin slipping into the room.  "Mistress Chiriga?"  The Usilin says nervously.  "The Master sent me to translate...and to, ah, check your spelling..."

Chiriga glances at the troll-skull and chuckles.
Finit.

The Orb, Pin, and Lyre of Power
By Feste DeOlivia

My story begins on a snowy day on the 27th day of the 11th month in the year 296. Past the Great Divide in the northern part of the Spur, the Great Waste, a young fifteen year old male Arachnian sword cleric of Set sat reading the journal of an ancient ancestor. It had been several decades since the Penthanians let loose the great UnMagick, stripping the spider-like race of their ability to control rune magick and the elder Arachnians still pondered a way to retrieve their ability to use rune magick and take revenge on the hated Penthanians mages. The young Arachnian, Galus, sat reading the old accounts of his great grand father, an Arachnian who devoted his life to retaining his rune magick. In the journal read (translated from Arachnian script):

"I've been searching for them for decades! When will I ever retrieve one of the mythical items? It seems as if the legends lie! Maybe it is a lost cause! And me, devoting my entire life to the pursuit of a lie. How could I be so naive to believe three mythical items could restore the power of the rune magick to our race once again!? A fiery orb, emerald pin and a golden lyre unlocking the powers of Sa, it seems all too clear to me now. Well, I shall pray to Set and retire for the evening, maybe he shall give me an answer."

The young Arachnian sword cleric sat still for a moment after reading the text.
"Could my great grand father have been right? Could the three items mentioned help our race to regain our full power and birthright?" young Galus thought.

Suddenly leaping to his feet, Galus ran, grabbed his money pouch and hurried over to the temple of Set in the Great Waste. Approaching the temple, he paused for a second, staring at the great altar before him. Slowly, he walked up to the altar and kneeled, opened his money pouch and placing 10 gold coins on the it. Suddenly, the gold coins vanished from the altar and the voice of Set boomed in the young Arachnian's mind.

"What is troubling you my son?", the thundering voice of Set asked.

"The journal of my great grandfather your greatness.", Galus thought speaking to the
deity.

"What of it?", boomed the voice of Set clear in his mind.

"There is an entry concerning three mythical items that are said to be able to bring the
power of rune magick back to our race", the young Arachnian thought.

"The legend you speak of is true. The three items you speak of are hidden throughout the great realms of land around you. The three items, a fiery orb, emerald pin and golden lyre are intricately guarded by traps, creatures and natural protection. The fiery orb is said to be placed in a currently dormant volcano in the heart of Tanga. Guarding it are various undead creatures such as dark revenants, also carnivorous spiders and an army of fire trolls surrounds the room containing the orb. The orb itself burns to the touch and one unfortunate adventurer incinerated his arm trying to pick it up. The room it is contained in is severely trapped, as the orb rests on a plate of stone that shifts if the orb is moved. This shift causes a disturbance which fills the room and the volcano with burning lava. The golden lyre is said to have once been owned by a seafaring female pirate whose ship sunk while plowing through a forming hurricane of the coast of the Spur. The ship then sunk to the bottom of the ocean, entrapped inside the lyre remains. It is believed that the lyre remains unscathed but is guarded by nasty palm crabs, giant lobsters, giant electric eels, water hydras and several other giant sea creatures. A Fir Elf once swam down to try to excavate the lyre from the ship but is said to have been strangled to death by a huge octopus. The emerald pin is said to be encased in a diamond egg, guarded by giant territorial vultures with giant ruby mail piercing talons and beak, not to mention a deafening screech. The diamond egg is said to be guarded in a cave in a mountain up 1000 feet from the ground. Legend says that the song of the golden lyre when the right notes are played in the right sequence may cause the guardians to sleep eternally. The cliff is so hard that even a Monitanian couldn't pierce his claws through it to climb. Exercise extreme caution when in your travels as we gods may not be able to directly intervene. The creatures mentioned have been known to deal out permanent death. On the altar I have placed a bag of all items necessary to complete your journey. Pray to me again once you've finished your quest.", the voice of Set boomed and slowly faded away.

Galus shook his head from side to side and was suddenly back in the temple of Set. Laying next to him was a brown leather pouch. The Arachnian slowly unfastened a strap closing the pouch and peered inside. Inside was the most beautifully forged suit of armor ever molded by an Artificer. A helm, mail, gauntlets, boots and shield were among the suit, all forged of a special diamond like substance able to withstand great amounts of heat and endure lots of damage. Also contained in the pouch were two vials, one purple, the other ruby. The purple substance in the vial was devised by an experiment gone wrong by an Arachnian alchemist. While trying to produce a chemically strong acid, able to dissolve the crystalline structure of Penthanians body armor, the Arachnian accidentally stumbled upon a formula to enhance the regeneration time of the web substance used by Arachnians and to make it more potent, crystallizing into an emerald like substance. The ruby vial contained 2 doses, one dose coats the lungs in a special substance able to hold air so the person doesn't need to breath for 15 minutes at max, give or take a couple of seconds.
Galus then suited himself in the armor, strapping the mail, sliding his hands into the
gauntlets and feet into the boots and finally placing the helm on his head. He then fastened the pouch and ran home to retrieve some items for the journey ahead.

Approaching his house, he noticed a strange glint coming through one of the windows. Cautiously, he approached, lightly stepping on his eight legs, strapped a light tarnished steel shield to his left arm and readied his gleaming opal bastard-sword in his right hand from it's sheath. Slowly, he pushed open the door and cursed as the hinges squeaked slightly. The young Arachnian stopped, listening for sounds of the intruder. After hearing nothing after a few seconds, he proceeded inside the house, closing the door behind him with his right heel. Galus then headed into the dining room, where he saw the glint. Only a couple of chicken bones lay strewn across the table from last nights dinner. Galus frowned and from the corner of his eye noticed a huge crystalline structure. Instantly, he turned around and shot a large mass of webbing towards the Penthanians. Unfortunately for it, it didn't see the mass coming and was immediately entangled in the great crystalline webbing of the Arachnians. 

Galus ran towards the Penthanians and shouted, "Explain yourself or
suffer the wrath of this blade of Set!"

The Penthanians nonchalantly replied, "That blade couldn't pierce my body, I'm not at a disadvantage like you petty creatures with flesh."

Galus then growled and swung his opal bastard-sword at the neck of the Penthanians, a huge cracking sound emitting from the blow, followed by a hoarse scream from the
Penthanians.

The Penthanians roared, "You'll pay for that spider"

At that instant, the webs suddenly faded away, giving the Penthanians just enough time to invoke a spell at the Arachnian. Quickly, Galus swung again at it, severing it's neck and watched the head roll off on the floor. The Arachnian then spat on the corpse and wiped the blood from the bastard-sword with an old rag. Suddenly, the runes that had gathered above the Pent exploded and dissipated into thin air as the body faded away, departing from the realms. Galus then wiped a small sweat bead from his forehead, sheathed his sword and headed for his store room. The store room was lined with huge shelves, capable of bearing the weight of thousands of pounds each. Lanterns, potions, weapons, armor, shields and piles of gold and silver coins stacked up in huge quantities.

The young Arachnian ran left and right, stuffing pouches full of gold and grabbing several lanterns and extra weapons. After collecting all he thought was needed, he recalled his familiar. In a rainbow shimmer, a huge undead denizen appeared. Galus smiled and pet the spectre's head. He whispered a command and headed south to the Spur, where an entrance to Tanga resided. As he headed through the gate leading to a path to the Spur, he looked back at the Great Waste and smiled proudly, then scurried off on his way followed by a floating spectre.

After a couple hours time, the sun began to set and the spider decided to pitch camp
underneath an oak tree by the side of the path. Setting the spectre on guard, Galus fell asleep, with opal bastard-sword clutched tightly.

In the middle of the night, a cool breeze brushed against Galus' neck and a stirring came from nearby bushes. The rustling awoke the Arachnian in which he instantly grabbed and readied his sword. Looking around, he saw nothing but darkness. Straining his eyes in desperation, they suddenly adjusted and the outline of the bushes came into view, a red glow emanating from the leaves. Slowly the Arachnian paced forward in caution towards the intruder....

Fantasia of the Wind (Deidlet's theme)
By Deidlet Yohkosan

Please give the mysteries to me.
A Fantasia awaits, to be filled.
My hesitations I have shed;
This is for the sake of our love.

Oh fairies of the wind!
Spread your magick wings and fly.
Racing at the speed of light.
Through the valleys and the passages of time!

To be in love with you, is Destiny
Please don't let the end come to our endless night.
I have decided, it's forever, because I am with you.

Oh please, come lay down to sleep,
and dwell within my heart.

If we just open up our hearts.
A Fantasia awaits, to be seen.
If we had only closed our eyes.
The dreams of two lovers will come true.

Oh oh veils of the wind! Lifts away and then we find
Double moons within the sky, framed by skylight windows 
shining in the night!

Last night when we watched the star filled sky;
many million years have passed, before we saw their light.
Surpassing all of history, for their light to reach us.

To be in love with you, is Destiny
Please don't let the end come to our endless night.
I have decided, it's forever, because I am with you.

Oh please come lay down to sleep, 
and dwell within my heart.

Tribute to Orchist
By Krrral BoldClaw

Orchist, 
Bro... buddy - pal. You were the first Khat I ever respected and looked to for guidance and still rank up there along with several others that have left the lands, Skratchnar, Suki, Pharoe, and others that are not of Leuian heritage like Jhered, Gollum, Ophilia, Jherek, Trelantris - there are too many of my friends/enemies/acquaintances to name them all, and mean no disrespect for leaving any out.

I remember the first time I met you - Livana introduced me to you in the Merc place sw of TS. You had this frog on your shoulder and it was the funniest thing to see you treat it like you did. Your enter/exit message stated something about you dragging your ego behind you or something to that effect and believe it or not bro I was going to try to be like you. A task I never accomplished in 11 months, even in the least way. It seems it took me (ok ok I am kinda slow) about 2 weeks to figure out you were a Thief. Did I have a coronary! You blew my whole perception of what an 'honorable' khat was to be and act. Here I was fresh from TG with the Tome of Honor in my claws willing to sacrifice all to rid the Spur of the foul Setite Leuians. Was I in for a rude awakening. I sought to slay those who opposed the 'pure' path of the Khat. The only way to be a "TRUE" Khat was to adhere strictly to the Tome I brandished at people and spewed forth from my ill-educated lips. And silly me was not even a member of the Pride. These misconceptions got me killed numerous times by Setite Khats and others who were friends of the so-called Abominations that you -Orchist- were the leader of. And all this time I was unaware of your affiliation with the Thieves' Guild. Khatmandu, Pharoe, and even the venerable Skratchnar eventually schooled me in my erroneous thinking and made me see the light. Never once did I mention any of this to you Orchist, for fear of alienating you. I realize we were never ever close friends, just mere acquaintances. We never hunted together and we rarely spoke, but you were one of the few icons the young khits, myself included, tried to emulate. I recall a Khit named Killias whom I followed from TG invoking your name at a bunch of Arachnians like you were his best friend in the whole world and would come to his aid if need be. The Arachnians fled after much posturing, and I asked Killias if he would search you out and maybe go a'huntin'. Killias laughed in my face and said he has never in his life even spoken to you and he always used your name to scare off would-be attackers that may have been a bit too much for him to handle. I thought that was pretty funny and Killias said he did not do it too much because he used to use TigerClaw's name as a shield until he got the fur beat off of him by his so-called savior after word got back to him a young khit was using his name as a scare tactic.

Well now you know my secrets... Thats ok - Now that I have licked the dingleberries from your sorry, no good, wanna-be Tarr'Khat, but can't cuz Skratchie liked ya too much, floppy eared, 100K owing, arse ::wipes nose:: we can get down to some serious flaming.

Flame 1 - What in Taath's Three Teeth did you believe that silly Drathian War Claw did? Surely you did not think that thing scared people.. Sure we cringed, but that was because we wanted to make you be nice to us and maybe you would not use that one damnable skill you excelled in on us. Picking.
Flame 2 - Speaking of Picking... Panthera told me recently you picked your nose constantly. What the heck is in there? I saw a slight glow once come out before you deftly hid it from view. Someone told me it was Sordum in there chisling for nuggets of gold. Your great snoz is legendary among Spur. You probably did not know it but everyone talked about that mountain of fur covered flesh on the end of you face. We did not say anything to you because it was rumored you kept Sordum prisoner in that thing for weeks!
Flame 3 - That silly War Claw I was told had several uses.
               
Drathian War Claw Use 1: Keep Sordum in line inside the ole snozzer by making a high pitched screeching noise as he scratched the inside area of his nose with it. It is rumored that the screeching is the only weakness that Sordum has (many of my team members from the Games will heartily agree) and the Glowie actually kept you on a 100K/week retainer to keep this fact a secret. But the goose is outta the bag now! A source close to Sordum (his Demon-mouse to be exact) revealed that the excavation of the snoz was not forced by you, but in fact initiated by Sordum! Turns out the nuggets he retrieves are a substitute for that Anti-Crazy Glowie-Juice all Psycians need to survive. A conspiracy has been uncovered! And all us non-glowies thought that they did not need that stuff anymore. Anyway, Sordum, sorry buddy but these Flames need to be re-directed back to Orchist now.. you will get your turn soon enough.
               
Drathian War Claw Use 2: It seems Orchist was addicted to reduxa as a khit (much worse than LordCrow the Frontie, now known as just Crow) and developed an expensive habit. And remember that ego Orchist used to drag behind him? Well, not only was his ego dragging, but his reduxa enhanced hind-side tended to drag too (much more than WarCool/Thoro's did by the way). The War Claw doubled as a booty-rake. Orchist could be seen taking a few steps then reaching behind him and raking in the flabs of fur like leaves on an autumn day with the dreaded War Claw. He would repeat this process until he either reached his destination or ran out of fatigue. And I always delighted in seeing him beg for a Trans from TS because he was afraid his rear-end would be too much of a pain to keep raking in behind him every 3-4 steps.
             
Drathian War Claw Use 3: As an impromptu backscratcher.  The story behind this function comes from that day Orchist decided to venture to the beaches of Tanga. Well, it seems the Palm Crabs and the Sand Fleas both have minuscule cousins that dwell within the dunes of the beach. One day resting in the shadow of one such dune, after a grueling workout dragging that flabby-booty behind him, Orchist discovered these most heinous creatures. They cause no physical harm but instead tend to hop onto their victim (helps if they have fur) and hide in the most inaccessible places of the body, namely the upper middle back and cause the victim to experience a feeling not unlike a rash or itchy infection. Needles to say, a quite an annoying insect. In fact, one particularly intelligent specimen tends to lie in a dormant state in the most private of body locations. These vilest of creatures have the psionic ability to detect the presence of sentient beings nearby (Oog's cannot be detected for some reason), and just when there are a significant amount of beings, they become unusually active. Dropping their dormancy like old coats, these crab-like creatures suddenly come to life biting and clawing their host in a feeding frenzy, subsequently causing the infected person to lose concentration on the task at hand and spend the next few hours rolling around on the ground, scratching, immersing themselves in water, shaving, or whatever, to relieve the extreme discomfort being caused by these creatures.

As a side effect of their psionic ability, the victim is exposed to massive amounts of psionic energy temporarily confusing them as to their whereabouts, and apparently is not aware of individuals nearby that may be watching in amazement as he runs about like a mad-man scratching and biting himself.(Ok enough of the psi-crab ecology, hee hee)

On one such occasion, Orchist and about 14 others, all close friends, including Panthera and a smattering of Orchist-spawned khits, were in TS just having a casual conversation. Every once in a while Orchist would use his War Claw to scratch his back where the 'normal-everyday garden variety' parasites were irritating him. 

All of a sudden Orchist lets out a crazed keening sound, unheard in the Spur for several hundred years - that of a Muatana-al being exposed to the deadly rays of the sun. Or a rat being squished by Paratwa's kicks... The sounds are hauntingly similar in pitch and volume, however coming from the lips of a semi-stable minded individual as Orchist - you can well imagine our surprise. Even the industrious Sordum was jarred from his perch inside Orchists snoz. (By the way - that's when I first noticed Sordum at work digging) - Panthera and the others politely turn their heads to allow Orchist time to recover his Sordum-faux pax and grimace at the pain in their ears, way worse than any music Michael "Wurmstealer/MerchantBane" StormBringer  has ever produced on his instrument of destruction he calls a lute. Me, being the NKOTB (new khit on the block - LMAO!) openly stare at Sordum's boot dangling from Orchist's left nostril, but at this stage Orchist has just barely enough presence of mind to shove it back inside and allow Sordum to return to his excavations.

Eventually Orchist takes on a wild-eyed look and starts foaming at the mouth (I figured this as a premonition of the soon to be implemented Berserk skill) and begins to hack wildly at all parts of his body with a spent torch that just so happens to have a bit of flame left in it.

So now, Orchist is smoldering and a wailing noise is emitting from his cracked lips, and we all stare in horror as Orchist catches a glimpse of his sheathed War Claw. Suddenly, he grabs it and begins to frantically scratch the offending areas to a blistering reddish color. (remember his fur has been singed off and we now see bare khitty-skin)  By this time Orchist has regressed to a state of sub-intelligence and is looking frightfully more and more like our favorite Thugian, Wesley.

He is so out of it that all attempts to get him to sit for healing or just an old fashioned band-aid are for naught. We had to rely on Benni and Tula to administer aid via spells and such, but it the scene caused poor Benni so much consternation that she accidentally dropped-carrier and the node demons snatched her to oblivion for 10-15 minutes. The rest of us were to stunned to react in any comprehensible fashion. However,  I remember steadfast Tula mentioning that she expects Acinonyx to behave in a similar fashion when she is due to stage so it would be good practice for her as she begins to giggle merrily, attempting to rid poor Orchist of his pesky parasites that she just so happened to notice with those sharp secian eyes of hers. Jainelle, Konichiwa, and Panthera can be seen in the corner of room comforting each other and holding their hands and claws over each others eyes, ears, and mouths (like hear no evil see no evil speak no evil monkeys) to keep the seen from horrifying them even further. In reality, they were not sobbing or crying, they were dying in laughter. But poor Orchist was so miserable they tried to disguise their laughter as weeping.

All this has happened in a matter of 30-40 seconds and in that time a sizable crowd of 20-30 Spurians have gathered in TS to gaze upon the spectacle of a crazed khat using his War Claw to scratch away invisible enemies (not unlike Blrak and his  once cursed stiletto, the silly Gobbie) on his body and a cackling ruby-eyed Secian chasing him with a tiny jar of secret khitty salve.

Well, things finally got back to normal after the salve was applied and Orchist calmed down. The state he was in left much to be desired and if I am not mistaken, believe Panthera had plans to consult a Justice for a separation on grounds of parasitic infestation. Orchist every once in a while would be seen picking through his singed and scarred body fur for the remains of those damnable creatures.

Orchist even hired an army of Gob-lin-als to search his fur in places he could not see and paid them 1 gold piece for every parasitic body part they recovered. GaggleBee was overheard suggesting a desire to rid Orchist of his minuscule foes by a cleansing fire storm. He was shouted down mercilessly by most of Orchists friends, except for Melraath who every once in a while could be seen absently scratching in several locations with a blank stare on his face.

OK.. sorry that was quite long for War Claw Use 3 but I figured it was necessary to relate the whole truth and nothing but the truth to you concerning Orchists' fetishes for his Drathian War Claw. If you have noticed anymore freaky things he does with that thing or have seen Sordum digging in that snoz, please relate all you know. Now that Orchist is gone, we have no fear of repercussions.

Since I have taken so much of your limited time I will allow others to continue the FLAME of ORCHIST and maybe we can get a new Folder called FRIENDLY FLAMES out of this Topic.. Hee Hee...(Editor's note-heh, not a chance) However I would like to point out that all this is written with absolutely no malice intended and those of you that respond with Flames of harsh nature should reconsider your words... this can be fun, lets make it so.
Oh, and by the way, Sordum was apparently unaware of the whole ordeal due to the dampening effect Orchists snoz has to the outside world and continued to gather his Anti-Crazy Glowie-Juice with absolutely no idea he was in any sort of danger. Danger? Yes, Orchist could have accidentally scratched the inside of his nose with his War Claw causing that paralyzing effect it has on Sordum and the psi-crabs could have infected Sordum. It is rumored next to Khat's the psi-crabs like to invade the ear wax of Glowies.  Can you imagine?!!? Sordum and his Demon-mouse shrieking like mad all around the Spur? Ack! Don't even go there! (not that he doesn't shriek enough already.. hee hee)

Love ya Orchist like a brother----

Drawing the Line
By Aubrei RHRashakae

I for one, often seek out injustice, try to make things right in the world.  Well, okay, so that's not true... I, as most others, choose to seek out and stop what we feel is wrong mostly when it directly negatively affects us.  That is the nature of sentient creatures, self preservation and accomplishment.  Therefore, I'm writing this because something happened that made me think, and because I know of others who have had the same problem happen.  Hopefully, I will be able to amend those difficulties, if not, then at least I'll feel better...

Hypocrite. An ugly word to say the least, almost never having a spec of decent connotation, a word that makes flowers wither and smiles die like so many ferals.  A common problem that we have in daily life is where that line is drawn; the line between items and ideas fitting to the realm and the ideas that have no place here.  But yet, I notice the line blurring, as it must, nothing pure remains as such often.  At a recent meeting with an Elder to discuss being able to trade in DFC credit, the item I wanted most was a black Agent of S.A.N. trenchcoat, that could go over armor.  I was flatly refused, no debate, no showing my side, nothing.  I understand that the Elders are the defenders of the line, making sure that everyone enjoys a healthy Role Playing experience.  I role play an Agent of S.A.N., I am an Agent of S.A.N.  I never thought that imagination was to be shoved into a box in the corner, forgotten,  while monotony played on.  I excepted the said Elder's decision, who am I to argue?  But then, how does one explain other Elders, killing people for the random fun of it, or having the items they posses? Returning- throw Twinkies, Chainmail Bikini's, Squishy Interworld Balls... How is an Agent of S.A.N. trenchcoat more damaging to the fragile framework of Role Playing than these? Elders deserve what they want, I've heard more than once, they have earned it.  This I do not deny, they all spend countless hours making our world a better place.  I only ask, draw the line.  Have it blurry, but do not allow some to walk all over it in utter ignorance of it's purpose.  If players have the resources to let them have an item that you don't deem appropriate, create a council, let them present their case, don't just say "I'll think about it" and when they bring it up again, refuse.  If I had been able to present my case, my information, and my reasoning, known that I was being listened to and noticed, then I wouldn't be here today, making a fool of myself.  I have seen some so- called  "important" and "upstanding" citizens of Spur with Pillow armor and Cardboard boxes. I don't deny them the right to nice things, I'm glad that they have them, and know that they have earned them.  But I wonder what would have been said if Jazbo or Sordum had wanted a black Agent of S.A.N. trenchcoat.  So I plead with you, Elders, Staff, and others that make the world turn, take the questions and pleas of the lowliest citizen to heart, take their considerations as you would take one from another Elder, and try not to say no to a trenchcoat with a animated chair next to you.

Tales of Stupidity
By Axe Hammersmith

These are a few tales that I have witnessed or took part in.

I was headed to the Market circle to sell a few things I had acquired in a recent venture into some goblin warrens, when I saw one of the merchants of our fair city waylaid by a young Dragon. I noticed that he was fairly new and did not know better, or so I hoped. I forced him to stop, but luckily neither of had to resort to weapons to settle the argument. I made him promise not to do it again and I bid him farewell. I went and sold my items and deposited the money in the bank. I then headed to Town Square hoping to meet some Hithuals. I was sitting in TS waiting for one to show up when all of a sudden one of Spur's townsfolk ran in screaming. Being the curious person I am, I headed west to investigate, and sure enough that little Dragon was sitting there attacking townies. I was mad, but I didn't think I should kill him just yet, so I decided to hear him out. When I asked why he was attacking them again he replied he didn't care what I said. I was greatly angered, and was going to teach him a lesson(without violence, hopefully), but a good Anthian came in and killed him before I could say anything. I'll admit the Anthian over reacted but that is what the Dragon deserved.

My second story occurred as I was coming back from the Haunted House, and was heading to train at the guild. I saw a Hithual just standing there, so I decided to talk to him, little did I know he was an insane feral. We got to talking when all of a sudden a newbie popped in and started asking questions, I tried my best to help him, and the other Hithual offered to take him to the bank and give him a sword. When he asked the newbie to follow him I became suspicious of the Hithual considering it odd that he didn't offer to let me tag along, so I followed them. I lost them in TS. I decided that he probably took him to the Market Circle bank. I headed that way and ran into the Hithual coming from that direction, when I asked if he gave the newbie a sword he replied", yes, right in his stomach". He then proceeded too laugh and ran off. Later he tried that with another Hithual, but the Hithual got away. I found out and was greatly angered, and chased him around TS, but unfortunately I could not catch him and get him to stay long enough for me to hit him. Luckily(unluckily for him), he had angered a few others as well, and they chased him and had better luck, for many people that were chasing announced him dead.

My third story is about a young Leuian thief. I was headed to the smuggler's tunnel when I happened upon the dead body of a noble. I headed south and found an Arachnian that I knew was not a newbie killing townies ,  I gave him a chance to speak but he gave very stupid excuses, so I knew that he was just doing it for no reason. At about the same time that I decided to teach him a lesson, some of Spur's insane guard sergeants arrived, and quickly dispatched the accused. Unfortunately they decided that I was his accomplice and started attacking me. I chose to run, rather than fight them all, and get townie killer killers to attack me.
My fourth and final story takes place right before that big party that was thrown by Armonius and Panick (Thanks by the way, it was a great party) A young Leuian was sitting in TS and was not talking or doing anything. Suddenly he kicked someone, not an MA move, but an annoying thing nevertheless. He gave no reason for his actions. I sensed that he was going to die very fast so I drug him north of TS because I know how much I hate the scroll when a fight goes on in TS. IN came the person's husband and in about two hits the Khat died.

What my four stories go to show is that stupidity in the extreme causes death. For every stupid thing you do there are terrible repercussions, which means it is a good idea not to do extremely stupid things. If you do do things that are extremely stupid and no one is around, you got lucky, but you can't count on that happening every time, so don't do stupid things when possible.

A Different Power
By Anzarn

You catch a glimpse of the large, muscular human from across the room, and after a brief moment of reflection, he beckons you over to sit beside him.  He stares into you, seemingly boring a hole directly through the center of your skull, his deep black eyes penetrating your thoughts.  He has been nursing the same mug of ale forever, it seems, and you inquire as to what troubles have befallen him.  Interestingly, he seems relieved to have found someone to sympathize with him... and this is what he says, albeit with a slightly drunken tinge to it:

"Ah... my name is Jhukarr... and how's about yers?  Ah, never mind, it doesn't matter.  My tale spans more years than ye likely have under your belt... ye sure ye want to bother?"

You consider declining for a moment, but seeing the shine of wisdom in the man's eyes, you nod with only a faint hint of reluctance.

"I worked fer me father for the longest time, ya see," the old man says in a louder-than-necessary tone, "and when me friends would come by I would be so happy if I could just take a short break... we worked hard, all of us... my mother, father, and all my brothers... there were six of us, ya know..."

You start to stand, to try to leave, but he says nothing.  You try to speak, but the words will not come.  He gestures briefly at the stool next to him, and you resume your seat.  You feel annoyed at how weak your will is compared to his, at the power he seems to have over you -- but you keep those thoughts to yourself.

"W- what are you?" you stammer in a vaguely fearful voice.

"I believe you would refer to me as a mage...  although, would that you took the time to listen... perhaps you'd call me otherwise."

Interested by his last comment, and by the seeming disappearance of his inebriation, you nod to him and reply: "If you are, indeed, a mage... " you say, raising one eyebrow, "What are you doing in a place like this?"

Brushing off your questions, he proceeds to swallow the rest of his glass in one gulp.  He begins, in a slightly gloomy, resonant tone:

"As I say, my name is Jhukarr.  My father was a druidic priest, my mother, I am not quite sure of.  I was taught in the mystical arts from birth, to manipulate the forces of Nature itself.  Though my father had hoped I would be his apprentice, he eventually decided to send me here -- to Spur -- to work as a Forester... he had told me that with my training, I would be the greatest one ever to grace the guild.  My father taught me something that many will never learn... that true power comes from awareness, and not blind loyalty to a ‘god' of some kind.  Awareness, he told me, was the sense that there is a certain amount of energy which runs through all things... you, me, even... this glass."

With this, he concentrates briefly upon the glass in front of you.  You blink, and it suddenly flies across the room, striking a large, burly-looking Thugian squarely in the jaw.  Grunting heavily, the oafish, smelly fellow starts over to you, but with a quick wave of Jhukarr's hand, he disappears in a shimmer of white light.  At this point, you notice the steady stream of quiet tavern patrons leaving through the open entrance, and ask inquisitively, "Exactly where did you send him?"

"Somewhere in Tanga... if I remember correctly... " the diamond-robed mage says through a bit of a smirk, "and at the very least,  that had the effect I had wished of it... this is a story best told to a small audience."

"My power, as ye likely know, does come from the Runes of Power I bear," he says, rubbing one palm with a small tattoo of a flame upon it, "but I have a rather... unique take... on why I control that power.  Most mages choose to believe their power comes from devotion to an arbitrary being, whereas mine does not.  I am not, as you might say, a Rune-Mage, in the sense that I was born with all the runes I possess; I derive my power from the trees, the grass, the essence of all things... it is for this reason that I was recruited... I suppose... by the Clerical guild of Spur when I first arrived.  I, of course, being not even quite as tactful as my father before me, declined rather rudely... I believe I compared them to a groveling bunch of sewer rats..."

Becoming quickly bored with all this talk of his power, you ask quickly... "So what exactly does all this lead to?"
"Well, you probably know as well as I that enemies are a threat to one's health.  I had, in one day, made an enemy of every ‘god' in this land, as well as the guild of their followers.  I now understand that your gods do not often make a point of forced intervention in the affairs of mortals; I suppose I posed a threat to their position in this particular society.  But whatever the reason, I was sleeping peacefully a number of nights ago, when three assassins and two trolls seemed to appear out of thin air.  I, of course, thought to myself that they would pose no threat, but they were blessed by some kind of boon -- they were entirely invulnerable to my magicks!  So, naturally, I fled... a well-placed blending web can do wonders for your state of health.  I sat outside my cabin for the longest time, after having treated myself, waiting to hear them leave... I commanded my wolf to come around their opposite flank as a spy, and found what I witnessed, or rather what he did, quite disturbing... they vanished in a wisp of black flame, curling up around them in the shape of a snake."

Raising an eyebrow, and in a somewhat doubtful voice, you say, "A snake, eh?"

"Aye, and that was only the beginning... in the next three days, I was subject to all manner of invasions of my privacy, large and small... indeed, I have seen more atrocities in the last two weeks than ye may wish to see in all your days.  Greater spirits, wretches, something calling itself ‘the reaper', ranging downward to those same trolls, assassins, and skeletons.  Fortunately, the subsequent attackers were considerably more vulnerable ", the mage says, again with a bit of a smirk, "and now I care not to know where they find themselves.  Still, I could not withstand these attacks forever, for although my robe will never break, my concentration one day might; I swallowed my pride and issued a formal apology to the Clerics of Spur, offering also to join the mages in their own guild."

"But," you say, in an inquisitive tone, "I, too, am a Mage... and I have not yet seen your name in our logs.  Have you been acknowledged fully yet, or are your skills being reviewed by the Guild Master as of now?"

"On the contrary, I have not been trained as you have, and instead, the Master has chosen to study my method of channeling so as to enhance the power of the Spur's mages.  I was flattered, but not quite willing to share my secrets... until he threw in a small ‘congratulatory fee' for my services... 10 million silver was a bit too hard to pass up, I might say..."

Just then, several guards burst in, shouting toward the cloaked mage vehemently:
"Jhukarr, the Governor of Spur has issued a warrant for your immediate arrest and imprisonment.  Will you come peacefully, " the captain says, stroking his pike, "or will we have to do this the hard way?"

With a twisted expression on his face, lost somewhere between misunderstanding and anger, he issues the simple response, "Let's have it, then."

Charging toward him quickly, the three guards find themselves quickly entangled in glowing red webs, seemingly crystalline in origin.  The look of utter disbelief on their faces was more than enough to satisfy the mage's sense of vengeance, and, gesturing to you, begins to walk out toward the door.

"Worry not, my friend, " he says, reassuring you, "I will dispel those webs once we are at a safe distance, and in a few hours they will be fine.  I do, however, want to find out why exactly they were granted that warrant..."

The mage proceeds to trace a number of arcane symbols in midair, and you vanish in a cloud of white light, only to reappear slightly dizzy in front of the Governor's Mansion.  Jhukarr whispers quickly to you, "Do not worry, this is the corridor just below his room, and we are past the guards already.  Walking up the staircase quietly, the almost imperceptible noises of the insects outside, along with the creaking of the stairs and the deafening silence of the crisp night air cause you to perspire heavily.  Coming to the thick oak door of the Governor's bedroom, Jhukarr opens it ever so slowly and proceeds inside.  He traces those same symbols once more, this time, in a wider pattern.  The room begins to glow an eerie white, and a smoglike mist floods in through the open window.  You once again feel a shifting sensation, and reappear, this time much more shaken, on the floor of a great wooded forest.

The mage, seeming much older in the rainy, moonlit night, says in the general direction of the Governor:
"I have done nothing to you, to your city, to your pitiful guilds.  Why have you ordered my apprehension?  My imprisonment!?"

Visibly trembling, soaking wet and completely unfamiliar with his surroundings, he replies:
"Nothing, eh?  You did not think that we, er, the guild, the high archmage would realize the extent of your power?  Ye did not think you would be able to live in our midst forever, did you?  Our mages may not have quite your extensive power, but they are very close, man, I tell you, and they will not be upstaged by a filthy, evil, piratical fiend!"

Seemingly flustered for the first time, Jhukarr stares into the Governor with those same piercing black eyes, but says in a faltering voice, "Wha - what do you mean...?"

Exceedingly pleased with himself, the Governor says, "We know of your druidic origin, of your father... your mother... "

"Speak not of my mother!" says Jhukarr, anger boiling up beneath his calm exterior.  "Slime!  Vile creature!"

"Really?  Well... then I suppose the story is unraveled here, eh?"  Turning to you and pointing toward Jhukarr, the Governor reclaims his stately tone and says, "This one's real name is Jhe'Ikat, and it is not human.  It is San.  It comes from the forest of Kil'Nhutarr, in the mountains outlying Spur."

Interjecting quickly, with his San features now showing through his previous disguise clearly, the mage says through yet another smirk, "What exactly do you think is stopping me from killing you right now?"

"Simply this." says the Governor through a smirk of his own, "You know, and do not tell me you do not, that you would be hunted until the day you die, by the guards, by their sergeants, by my children, and my children's children, if need be, and that even you, great mage though you be, could not evade them forever."

His spirit broken, the San disappears once again in brilliant flash, leaving you with one important unanswered question.  You stagger over to the Governor, and in a reluctant voice, ask:

"Sir... exactly who was that?"

"Well," he begins, in that familiar, irritating, aristocratic tone of voice, "his power, as you know, was far different, though not much more powerful, than our mages of Spur.  The reason why was simple... he has never been formally trained in the magickal arts, and that became painfully evident when he was tested by the Master at the guild.  Through various sources, we have learned that the man, er, elf, gained power through a sort of ‘inheritance' from his father.  Being how wonderfully scrupulous they are, " (the Governor pauses for a quick laughing spell) "one of his ancestors had long past managed to procure the essence of a Dragon from the Great Hunt of many years past.  Somehow, the mages have surmised, the essence, which has been passed down through the family since that day, came to be bonded to this young one's father, and evidently he has somehow inherited that power, as his children likely will from him.  We can only hope that, with time, the bond which links the magickal properties of the essence will fade, and these powers will begin to lay unused."

Taken aback, and still fearful of the return of the strange, elven mage, you manage a fairly weak response, indeed, your last word of the night.

"Interesting."

Tscina Neophite's Autobiography
By Tscina Neophite

Once upon a time, When I was very little, my parents were killed in my home lands of T'Khera. I walked for many days and nights and couldn't go any further. the next thing I knew was I was laying on a worn stone inside of a cave with a bunch of thugians staring down at me, pokin me, tryin to tickleme or somethin. At first, I didn't know what to think as I glared upwards at them as they shoved some kind of part of an aminal into my mouth, so I ate it and got my strength back within hours. Time passes, years go by, and in that time, I basically learned to fix their armor up, stitch up there aminal skin boots, and TRIED to keep the cave semi clean, but they always seemed to like to live in filth.. Then, when I was about 10 or so, they sent me out of tha house for long time, and told me to come back later, and so I did, and when I returned to the cave, I was greeted with some hugs and numerous kegs of ale which lined the cave wall. It was about 8 years that I had been there and was my time to start working on who I was to become and they knew this also, because they had done this once before, with my brother, Galnin, but at this time, I did not know I even had a brother. The next morning, when all awoke from their drunken slumber, they went on with their normal day activities of hunting and a lot of scratching... All but one of them, the one Thugian who mainly took care of me and made sure I was fed and safe. He looked as if he was waiting for something.. Moments later, we all saw what was to come. Something this day was very different indeed. The skies suddenly darkened with a deep purplish haze as bright red-orange bolts shot through the morning skies. One of the bolts headed directly towards our cave, and struck the ground. The lands all around for miles trembled as the bolt hit the ground. Swirls of smoke surrounded something. A dark figure, and when the smoke died down, an enormously tall elderly man was left standing there. He had long white hair with these light blue, almost white, eyes and was dressed in midnight-blue satin robes.

The wizard taught me throughout the next few years, teaching me spells and implanting runes into my body. But then the time came for him to leave me, but just before he left for the last time, never to return, he implanted the final set of runes into my delicate body, but this was not all. He also gave me two special gifts which he finally believed I was truly ready for at this time. He implanted the last of my runes, being my translocation rune, a mystical rune known to only the most advanced races and magicians that has the power to move a person from place to place, distances that would take many moons to get to by foot.  The second rune was a sleep dart.  He said this would aid in hunting with the others, to sleep the being, making it easier for me to actually hit something or even strip it of whatever I wanted, thus explains my fascination with thievery.  The wizard also bestowed some of the most useful and most powerful magick upon me, that I have ever held. He granted me with the power to bring dead and dying creatures and mortals back to life.

Finally it came time for him to grant me the two special gifts, being the strength of a tiger, and the ability to heal with a mere thought and hand placement. Then, with some words of encouragement, praise and something that he said that made me wonder, he snapped his fingers, and in a ball of fire, he shot back into
the heavens above from whence he came those many years ago, never to return again.

The strange thing that he said to me was to be ready by the time of my 16th birthday for something interesting and magickal that would change everything.  Well, twas not long after that the Thugians would take me on hunts with them after I demonstrated my newly acquired powers, and I think I even accidentally shot a sleep dart hitting one of them in the butt, and he fell down for many minutes unconscious. ::giggles at the memory:: The others thought this was funny that I, a tiny little being could take down such a large being.

Later that night, the old wizard's words I would find come true... As I lay down to go to sleep while the others still ate and feasted on their kill, I shrieked out in pain. My cry was so loud that you could very easily hear it miles away. The others came running into the far end of the cave where I slept, wondering what was wrong, wondering why I was crying and had tears streaming down my face.  The one that cared for me the most scooped me up into his arms, but noticed something strange as he turned me over in his arms onto my stomach. They all gazed at my back as a couple of small slits in my skin on my back had began to open up. From what I heard of their grunts, I somewhat understood what they were saying. They basically described it as small patches of skin on my back were opening up and my old skin falling to the ground. The pain began to subside for a brief minute, and then, the brunt of the pain set in. As he gripped me tightly in his arms so I would not fall down and hit the hard ground, I screamed out in agony. This was the most intense pain I had ever felt before.  I ended up passing out because the pain was so strong.

I awoke about 30 minutes later to find that I had indeed changed. I felt stronger than ever before. My face was soiled from rubbing up against the Thugians armor when he held me tightly, so i walked over to the small pool of water in the center of the cave.  The torches illuminated the center of the cave well, and as I kneeled down to cup some water in my hands, I saw something different.  I flexed a few muscles in my back, and these things started to move! I was truly amazed! I had grown wings! At that point, a voice echoed throughout the cave, one so familiar, yet no one was there. The voice was that of the old wizard.. He said "And with the strength and charisma of you, my little one, the name I give thee is one that stands for the blood of fire, heart of a rose, and a soul as prickly as its stem. Your name shall be Tscina. You have reached adulthood, symbolized by the growth of your wings. You are now complete... You are now ready for the last, true test.. Survival.. Good luck little one..." and with that, silence filled the room and remained that way for several minutes.. I finished rinsing my face of, stood up, and turned around to face the others, and smiled. They ran towards me and all gathered around me, taking turns hugging me, grunting and cheering.

Morning came and I sat on top of the hill which the cave was under, drying out my wings and fanning them, learning to use them.  My first few flights quite frankly sucked. I don't think I got more than 5 feet off the ground and fell down into the soft grassy patch atop of the hill.  By the time the sky turned deep blue and pink from the setting sun, I could fly as graceful as an eagle, higher than the treetops, and longer than the stars above.

The next day came, and I went hunting with the others. This was to be my first time this far from home. I had never ventured farther than the edge of the woods.  We stopped at a slow moving stream to get some water to drink. As I kneeled down to drink the water, I saw something strange. An aminal I have never seen before. It was weird looking. It had fins on the sides and top yet it stayed underwater, and I couldn't stop thinking, how can it survive underwater, without coming up for air, so with that, I put my head underwater, looking all around, then I found that I couldn't breath so I quickly pulled my head out of the water, choking and gagging from trying to breath in the water. How silly of me, and I never attempted that again.  But we stayed there for a little while longer, the others amused at watching my actions, as I made faces at the water creatures, making googlie eyes, sticking my tongue out at them and all. Then, one of the creatures came just below the surface of the water and spit some water at me! I jumped back, glared at the creature, and rubbed one of my newest runes and pointed at the water creature.. Within seconds, a greenish-white aura surrounded me, and shot towards the creature. Figuring out what I had done moments later as it just lay there on the bottom of the stream. I had put the creature to sleep! I stuck my hand into the water, poking the creature, seeing if it would move. It didn't, so I grabbed it by the tail and pulled it out, staring at it, examining it, and yes, I even smelled it.. Ick, it didn't smell too great now, but I would find that it would smell even worse later, but there was a problem. The creature never did wake up.
The Thugians all grunted and chuckled as they watched me swing this creature around by its tail.  They called this creature a "fish". Later on, this "fish" would prove to be the most powerful and skillful weapon that I would have and use to hunt and defend myself with.  The others stood up and motioned for me to join up with them as they left the area. I flew a couple of feet above the group, waving and swinging my newly acquired weapon around, strangely, never loosing its flexibility nor its sliminess. All but the tail end which I griped it by which turned almost rock hard yet strong.

Time would pass and with it, my fighting skills grew, my weapon being the slimy fish. I would swing it around, whacking all sorts of things up-side the head with it, stunning and knocking some of them unconscious with one swing.  I could fight about as well as the rest of them, but I also proved to be one of the best healers throughout all the lands. Messengers would be sent for my presence at other parts of the lands, to heal those sickly and dying, and even those that had recently died, which i brought back to life.  I was paid mostly in gems, which i knew as "sparklies". I had a thing for small shiny, sparkling things. Each week, the small pile of these sparklies right next to my sleeping area grew bigger and bigger.  Later on, I found all of these sparklies were worth much in the surrounding cities.  I ended up trading a few of my sparklies for items, such as pretty rings, necklaces, clothing, armor, lanterns and even some food for when I was traveling throughout the lands.

Then came my time of great hatrid towards all. As I headed out of the last city,to head home, I felt a tug at my knapsack, so I quickly turned around to see a shadowy figure running into the dark alley way. I paid no attention to it because nothing like this had ever happened to me before.  Strangely, my load felt much lighter, so I took my knapsack off and saw that the top was undone.  As I looked inside of my knapsack, I cried out in sorrow.  Over 50,000 in silver, gold and sparklies were gone, as well as my only lantern. I was left with enough food to last me through the night, and the trip back to home was 3 days away and I had no more money to buy any more food.  That night, I slept atop of a shack off to the side of the road leading into the forest, with only my clothing to keep me warm throughout the cold blackness.  I portioned the food that I had left and spanned it out to last 2 days, leaving me hungry for the last night.  I tried to fly home most of the way to cut down on my travel time, but it was extremely hard with little nourishment, thus my strength decreased little by little every hour. Then came the last night.  I was out of food, extremely tired and a good day's time from home.  With the last bit of strength I had in me, I flew up into the tree-tops for shelter, so that I wouldn't be prone to animal attacks from the ground throughout the night.  My clothes were soiled, my hopes and happiness scared by recent events, and above all, I wondered if I would even make it home.  That night, I cried myself to sleep as I munched at the leaves of the tree I was nestled in, trying to rebuild the energy that I had lost that day. I slept for a long time, and didn't awake until high noon the next day. If I were to make it home by the evening that night, I would have to fly fast, and almost non-stop.  I flew out from the tree, found some berries on the bushes on the ground and ate them for strength.  I even took some and put them in my knapsack for later.  Quickly, I gathered the rest of my belongings and started off on the way back to home. It was tough but I finally made it.  As I crossed over the stream and trees which looked so familiar to me, I saw, not to far up ahead, the top of the hill where my thugian family was, or were at least.

I landed but noticed something strange.  Large tracks in the ground surrounded the entrance of the cave and led off to the south.  I started to shiver in fear as I slowly and silently walked into the cave. Everything was in shambles, the table with deep cuts in it as if slashed with a sword. An aqua coral dagger, the one that I gave to the one that cared the most for me as a gift, lay on the ground, covered in dirt and blood.  I picked up the dagger, held it tightly in my arms, sat down and cried, not caring anymore about food at the moment. I fell asleep not too long later, still holding the dagger in my arms, crying..

Morning came and I awoke. As I sat up, the dagger fell to the floor. At that moment, I had a new cause. I had a new purpose in life.  That dagger was the turning point in my life.  I picked up the dagger, slipped it into my belt, and cried out: "WHY!?"  I went mad, casting all sorts of spells all around me. Within roughly 10 minutes, everything in the cave was destroyed.  I gathered up what was left that I might use later, and walked out of the cave.  As I turned around, looking back at the cave, my home for over a decade and a half, knowing I would never return to it again, I took my last look at the entire hill, took flight, and flew south, following the tracks left behind from whatever enslaved my family.  The tracks wrapped all around going from south, to east, to north and then east again. I was a good day's travel by foot away from home when it started to rain in the middle of the day.. With that small shower, the tracks were gone. I was lost in the middle of nowhere. The only thing that I saw was a dark lining in the southeastern horizon, and so I went towards it. 3 sun's and 2 moons passed as I came upon the edge of a city. The guards glanced at me, as I spoke in the only language I knew, other than bits and pieces of what the thugians spoke, when I asked if I could enter the city. I somewhat understood them as they laughed and chucked at my asking for entrance. They basically said that my kind is always welcomed here, but the way he said it was in the strange tongue I have never heard before.  As I flew into town, I passed through a golden archway formed by a pair of grappling dragons. This area was the towns square, where all of the locals and even foreigners came to meet one another.  Others of my kind were fluttering but as soon as I entered, my clothes all soiled, face and body all dirtied.

Suddenly, a silence seemed to slowly cover the entire square.  Everyone stared at me as if something was wrong. Then, one of those, just like me, with wings, spoke out in my native language, saying: "Hello, Welcome to Spur.  I am Teariel. You look like you have traveled a long, long way. Come with me, I will help you get cleaned up!" and with that, I had made my first friend.  My clothes were washed and hung out to dry, I was cleaner than i had ever been before, but who was this strange person, this...Teariel. What did she want from me? From my experience, it has always been that if you do something for someone, they usually want something in return, and with this in mind, I opened my knapsack and offered her an emerald sparklie for payment.  To my surprise, she wouldn't accept it, saying it was part of the ways of her kind, to do things without expecting anything in return.  This was all new to me, and I swear I had eaten some bad berries or leaves earlier.. But later I would come to find that it was real.

Varchild: The Portrait Of A Madman
By Varchild Neophite

<<They claim I am evil, yet they have barely seen it...

I may be mad, but I know what I am capable of...mine was a heart completely filled with dark rage... Rage toward an unknown foe...And it was that same rage that summoned the shadow so long ago...My recent events in life have changed me forever…the blessings of a new daughter, and a wife who shall never leave my side, as long as we both live....

Everything has its dark side....yet it is in how we perceive it that makes it what it is to everyone every where...I will admit to taking lives, which I am rather very ashamed of, but what I have never done in my life, is openly insult or degrade a fellow secian...I have too much respect for the others of my race to do that, yet they go around, preaching how "dark" & "evil" Varchild is...How can they judge me? To put me out in front on a platter, with a sign that says : Rotten to the core.? For to judge another is to let your self be judged...and it is time they get judged as I have been...

Evil? What is evil? one may never know...for if I truly am evil...then what else is there to say? Yet the root of the problem stems farther back, past the judgment or birth of Varchild Neophite, but to the time when Namdor walked the realms, that is what sheer chaos is, many try to compare me to Namdor, but those who try are judging, and put themselves in a position to be judged, for that is where the ultimate evil is, to judge with out proper proof, and wrongly accuse.... In the trial of Jhered Narbondel, a Secian...a Secian by the name of _____, testified against Jhered, but what many over look is the fact that _____ couldn't remember a thing... and those of my race should notice a continuing pattern with _____...he provokes me into anger and rage against then turns around like he didn't do anything...such a fool will turn a thousand times over in his grave knowing this....I never attacked him un-provoked...Yet he goes and openly insults m daughter, my own flesh and blood, my contribution to this world once I leave, the one most innocent thing of all, a simple child..._____ dares to insult a simple child...now ask yourself if that is evil?

Madness? I may be mad, crazy, a complete and total lunatic, all because I try to protect my wife? Is that insanity? for if it is, then I am the ultimate form of insanity......

Tale of the Dreamer
By Anonymous

2 years ago, when I was young, I met a old hithual hidden in a cave through the sewers of the Spur. He was very weak, but, a handsome man and of graceful character. He didn't give me his name, but wanted me to record his story as he told it. Using my memory, he gave me his autobiography for the world to know and share. Here is his story:

"Many of you know me. If not, I'm not surprised. Many of you dislike me. For that, I am not surprised. Many of you disregard me. That I am not surprised. I don't care for what you think of me. I am just a dreamer trapped in the body of a man. I just wish I was myself. I wish you thought of me as a person. I doubt you care."
	
I interrupted, "Wait, old friend, who are you? A visionary? A liar? A prophet? Or simply an old quack?"	
	
The man smiled at me, and continued.

"I was born almost a century ago in a land far away. To me, it was my homeland. To you, it is the Great Divide. I loved it there. I was known as "lil un" by friends and family, even though by age 21 I grew to a size of 3 feet 10 inches. I tried to gain in knowledge there through the various guilds, but none appealed to a character like me. I was to relaxed to work on skills. I lived life. With my family behind me, I was forced into become a sword of Odarous. I'll be honest: I didn't enjoy it. My talents were not in fighting. I wanted to be famous. Music, acting, theater... It all appealed to me. 
	
"One year later, my father, Nordar, decided that I was to be taught a lesson and not to do anything but skills. He locked me in the land of the dead, a good walk from my parents shack outside of the Great Divide. Trapped there, I managed to survive by finding a broken shovel and used it to dig a home, and, unfortunately, I was forced into vandalism of ancient crypts, tombs, and sarcophagus for personal items. Food was a problem, with only rats and rotting corpses lying on the ground. After a while, I found out how to access fire from scratching my bastard-sword with a piece of flint, and I was able to have food that had "taste" After a few levels up, I was allowed out, famished and thirsty. Elindale knows how long I slept.
	
"When I was the tender age of 24 years I decided to wander around the Great Divide in search of adventure, music, and a chance to think. I met many people, who taught me tricks of the trade into getting things for free, learning about the economy, and most importantly, to perform. The travels, though weary, gave me a chance to make some money, learn a few songs, and truly find myself. 
	
"When returning to my parents shack, I noticed a note, left for me, which read 'We have been very disappointed in you, our son. You were born a great warrior. You have left your talents be wasted. Only return if you have completed your life.' Stricken, I stabbed at the note, frustrated at what they had said. I snuck into the house and found some belongings: a light quartz mail, my sword, a few silver, and a copy of Mastand's "Land of Illusion." I looked upon my parents house with contempt and turned my back, with no sense of direction.
	
"After some fruitless traveling, I decided to head to the city of Hammoi, better known as "the jewel" in hithual. I saw the great monuments made out to the leaders and heroes of our day. I thought "cursed be them, to be trapped in the role of a hero or leader." I moved on, through Hammoi, and finally found a small marketplace, where I exchanged as many of my goods for gold. I bought mostly food, and decided to take up a temporary residence in Hammoi till I felt ready to move on. 
	
"That did not take long at all for me to make up my impatient mind. I walked for hours out of the city, and reached a tattered signpost, showing the ways to Hammoi, Bar-Nakath, and, fatefully, the Spur. I thought to myself "A place with people outside of my race?" I'll go!" And I embarked on a long journey, alone, cold, and no home.
	
"Thank goodness I wasn't killed on the trip. The roads, though steep and narrow, were clean of thieves, save that one peddler who sold me "a diamond saber" when it turned out to be zirconium. The trip was an approximent 500 miles, and, when I finally reached the Spur, I was 35 years of age. 
	
"I came from the south of the spur, through the highlands, hedge lands, and, somehow, made my way up noble way and into the Town Square unharmed. I saw no one of my race, at the time. I looked at all the unfamiliar faces and races, and thought "man, a bunch of freaks. Cats, Lizards, and these giant reptiles?" I decided to purchase a cheap map from the merchant district and started to find my way around the grand city.
	
"No one came to my aide or came to help me, so I was a loner for about 42 years, with no one to help me.  I would sit and read "Land of Illusion" forever, slowly learning another language from the signposts and shops. I finally figured out how to speak both secti, the clerical language, and common, the basis of all languages today. With 2 dialects under my belt, I was ready to fulfill my destiny, and what my parents wanted.
	
"I found the arena to be my new death yard. I was worse than an amateur gladiator and was to scared to venture below noble way, for fear of the many robbers and such down there. Tortured by the agony, I decided to stop working on my skills and try to make many friends. 	
	
"It took me over 2 years to find my first friend, a dragon of immense skill and bravery. He took me far and wide over the spur, showing me the graveyards, how to use a shield, a sword, and my wit. After a few months of adventuring, I tried to find a hithual friend, someone with a common interest. I met a young hithual teeming with knowledge and wisdom, and a sword to back up his words. I looked Upon him with jealousy, for he had so much, and I, with so little. I sat and pondered the situation, and decided that if I make more friends, and do less skills, I would have a great chance in spurian society.
	
"Slowly, I built up friendships. I met young hithuals up from a "training ground" who were much stronger than me. I met many leuians, which I had come to find out their name, and dragons, flerians, and other races. People grew strong, while I stayed behind. Although this was bad for me, it helped me become a man of integrity and flexibility. I decided to never look upon a person with contempt again, or hate.	
	
"People became more and more apparent in my life. With wise words, a hithual council was created by my friends, and I joined almost instantaneously, and became known to be a weakling with a sense of humor. I heard of various other groups, and a group based upon honor seemed to interest me, and joined within the month. I thought I am stronger when I am with my friends.'  That I did. I made many good friends, and many that are still to this day. A couple that showed me what love was. A nation built like rocks. A secian with a heart of gold. A drag-al who showed what true poetry was. And a pair of fir elves who showed me true honor.
	
"Still, I grew from the young man I once was. I felt confident, and full of life. The feeling of being loved,  was what I needed. I learned to control my soul and not to shatter my eye over the world. The time for me to grow skill wise was coming, and, I after much work, I finally grew to become  respectable cleric.
	
"Tragedy came upon my sheltered soul when a sudden plague destroyed half of my friends. I was left alone, once more, and took up shelter in a home in the Poor Quarter, almost becoming reclusive. I was devastated by the loss of friends, and thought that the world wasn't for me, and I thought of stabbing myself, and no one would ever know whether or not I was dead.  
	
"A voice spoke to me at that time, bewildered, I fell to the ground, to pay homage to the entity. "Spare me, o great one!" I yelped, in fear of utter destruction. The entity took form as a sphere containing the face of only a goddess. It spoke to me:
	
" 'Little one, why are you afraid? For you have been chosen. Chosen to become great, to do much, to speak your mind. You are no longer held back by the yoke of your friends. You are you. Become yourself. Think. Breathe. Live.'
	
"I managed to plea: 'But why must you pick me? I am not strong. Not smart. I am just living under shadows. Trapped under the  constant web of fear and hate. I mean nothing to you or anyone. I can do nothing for you. See, my robes are tattered and worn. Look at my chest, you can see my bones. Look at my face, and see the blood of my friends come out as tears. What I am to you?'
	
"The entity smiled, and stated: 'Child, you are the next person to become great. Your time is near. You have found what it means to be a man. By putting yourself down for others. You are the only one to be yourself. To not be a so-called warrior, but to chose your own destiny. Stand, for I have to see you face to face.'
	
"I stood, weary, and looked at the entity. She said, once more: 'A major change is coming in your life, and I will not, and cannot, control it. The thoughts that you once had will become your life. My dear boy, if you could only see what is in store for you. In due time, it will come.'
	
"I managed to say: 'I trust your words, my lord. Please, save me from the displeasure in life, and allow me to be myself and fulfill me so-called role.
	
"In a blinding flash, a floating red ball suspended, whirling at a speed so fast it burned to touch it. The entity said to me, 'This ball is your life. It never stops. It's path always changes.' A thunderclap emerged, and the ball started whirling in one direction, but just as fast as before. 'Your destiny has been set. You have been saved.'
	
"Bewildered, I could merely gape at the sight. I stared, and, a breeze blew, and a cry came to my ears, of 'Brother, brother, where are you? We need to work on skills!' I turned my head in the direction of the voice, seeing my great brother, the bluntsmaster. I looked back to where the entity was, but all I saw was a tattered paper, with the words in hithual for 'Promised one.'
	
"I tore the paper to pieces, unable to believe what I had seen. I disregarded the situation and decided it would be best to exhibit my talents with poetry with the bardic recitals, which I was able to pull in one first place finish, for a piece of work I don't think I should have won. I worked on skills with my brothers, and thought about the mysterious entity continuously.
	
"I decided it would be best in my life to start a new beginning, or a new image, however you would like to think of it. I started practicing guitar and mandolin, and spent many an hour meditating and thinking about the state of the world. Something felt wrong. Horribly wrong. I felt deceived by the world. One of my best friends, a leuian, lost all of his skills in a tragic accident. I was shocked by that instance, and felt a need to help him at all costs. 
	
"About one week later, another one of my friends vanished without a trace, without a word. I was destroyed, and kept on asking 'Why, why?' to myself, for me and him would goof around and be mischievous to the presiders of the spur. I was angry then, and couldn't concentrate or think on a specific topic for more than a few minutes.
	
"While I searched for my inner peace, worse news came. My same friend, and his wife, were about to fall victim to the plague, and were forced to move to another world to be saved by it. Furious, I demanded that they stayed, no matter what the situation or idea. I did not want to lose anymore of my good friends.
	
" Luckily, I managed to keep them here for a while longer. I felt, that by proving myself to the Spur, that I might have fulfilled my parents quest for me. The time was right, and i ventured back to the mainland via the southern roads.
	
"This time, the trip was much more dangerous than before.  Being the smart type, tried a shortcut, a long winding path through the woods of Mel-kalai. Unfortunately, I fell into a devious trap created by odd forest creatures. 2 heads, 4 legs, and 2 arms were these cruel creations from the chaos of the forest. I was entrapped by them in a dank cave, stuck in there for what seemed to be ages.
	
"I was watched day and night by these creatures, noticing their queer movements, their odd language ( a clicking sound, not that unlike an arachnian's),
and when they switched their guards. Thank Elindale that they didn't strip me of my weapons. I was able to take my dagger and chip away. They never peered in, and probably thought I was trying to kill myself. With no food, I was getting weaker, and, thanks to some bread I packed, was able to keep myself alive off of what ever I saw, be it worms, maggots... 
	
"After 2 weeks, or from what I could tell by the sunsets and sunrises, I finally found out what was planned for me. Like normal, outside of the cave I could see fire all around, and a low murmur of 'Malaki, dornas, Malaki, makra, Malaki, Epta!' I looked outside, at the growing crowd, and saw a young flerian bound, screaming. One of the creatures in a giant mask pulled a long, broad dagger, of craftsmanship rival to only that of hithual forges. Scared as I was, I watched in horror as he used the dagger to slit the flerians vein, and, through a small channel within the dagger the blood flowed down into a cup made out of tangled weeds. The flerian was watching this in horror as his precious blood flowed like a stream from the mountains, and nearly fainted.
	
" I pressed my face against the webbing around my cave, to see the sights even more. The cry of "Malaki favka, Malaki banda!" came to my ears, and the blood sped up, and flew into the cup at a rapid pace. To see death come upon this poor flerian in this matter was to much. I cried out to my god Odarous to help the poor fellow, and granted him health. Rejuvenated, he smiled at me, but the torture continued him, and I could not stop it this time. I saw the spirit of my companion fly from his body, and witnessed his last breath. I screamed at the beasts, and they turned there attention towards me. 
	
"I felt my blood rise to a level so high that I felt like I was going to explode. I drew my sword, the blade I commissioned by master Rehas for me, and set my shield for the oncoming rush of foes. For the first time, I looked into their eyes, to see what they were really like. But I saw nothing. Cruel, cold blooded killing machines without a heart or soul. I felt they deserved to die, and looking at their pikes, I saw no contest now. Hatred versus killers. And I shall triumph.
	
"Sword in hand, the first 3 creatures, or Malaki as I grew to call them, were no contest to my sword... But the rest had cunning weapons, half pike and half mace, and were able to beat me nearly into submission from the combinations of attacks. I fell to the ground, wheezing, and used my final favors to sanctuary me back to the altar of Odarous.... Where I returned in a matter of seconds.
	
" 'I am a coward! I total coward! I left them there!' I thought continuously. I healed up and marched out of the spur, and followed my same path.. and only 4 things remained: my friend, the cup, a mask, and a parchment written in... hithual?? I grabbed the parchment and read it carefully:

 'Promised one,
 promised son. 
once a coward..
now a hero'
	
"Bewildered by it, I saved the parchment in "Land of Illusion," and read the second paragraph from the book:

'The wanderer stopped, and carefully looked through his belongings, for the note of his love. He cursed the day he was born to get stuck here. To be trapped in his dream. But was he really here? Was he even alive? The thought stuck in his head, like a fly to a fruit. Intrieged by this notion, he let his eyes look up at the city before him, and forgot about the note.'
	
" I ran my hands through my hair, and thought 'am I trapped in my dream?' I closed the book and buried my friend, and offered him a silent prayer that odarous would save his soul. I continue up the path and up the narrow bridge to the Great Divide where I found the city of Hammoi... gone?? I ran up to the place where I once entered the city 70 years ago, and saw a parchment lying on the ground, simply stating: 'Thy quest is nearly fulfilled.'
	
"I ran as fast as I could to the house where I once was born. The shack... a small mound, with 2 graves where it once stood. Those of my parents. I cried out in sadness, and struck my sword in the ground. For 2 nights, I wept. Scared of what might happen next. I looked at my parents grave and walked around it.. until I noticed a note lying in the ground, with the name 'lil one' on the envelope. I peered at it, and opened it... Here is what I saw."
	
The old man reached inside of his left pocket and pulled out a tattered envelope, and handed it to me. It's contents read as follows:
	
"Son, you have done us proud. To stand up in what you believe in. To be yourself. To find out who you are. No fighter or cleric has ever stood up for what they believe in. To follow their dreams.  We are proud of you, our son. Your quest has been fulfilled. Go to the Spur, and follow our Maiden forever."
	
The mans eyes filled with tears as he tried to continue. "I did what they told me. I followed Elindale... I became a man. I fulfilled my role in the spur. My friends, though nearly gone, are still with me. In my heart. Soul. I lived to tell this story..." The man reached inside his bag... and pulled out a dirty old novel... I could barely make out the words "Land of Illusion" on it.. Is it the same book? 
	
"I want you to have this, my scribe."
	
"But why me? I just am writing your words. You are the author."
	
"You deserve it, lil one"
	
Those words shocked me.... Why am I the lil one? I am not the man of the hour.
	
"My old friend, can you just tell me one thing?"
	
"Yes?" A curious smile came to his face.
	
"Who are you?"
	
The man pointed at me.... At me? "The one who grew to be respected in the spur. I am. The man who grew to be loved. I am..."
	
A brilliant light and a clap of thunder came, and the old man was gone in a flash... Only thing that was left was the book... "Land of Illusions" 

"Boy, idiot, dolt, wake up!" Voices, around me, but who? I looked up, and saw Kraggon, Aros, Shamus, Yulin and Blade staring at me.
"
Ya were in a coma, you lugnut..." Aros snickered.

"But nice fight." Shamus offered.

"Ah'm sorry I didn't cover you then, friend." Yulin stated, thinking it was his fault

"Oh, we noticed that when you were out, that you were holding something. I got it with me." Kraggon's eyes sparkled when the words left his mouth, and he went to his pack.

"It was so much like you, I couldn't let you leave without it." Blade crooned, and I smiled. My poor friend lost all his levels in an accident, I still pity him, and pray he somehow gets them back. But still, I was shocked when Kraggon pulled out... a tattered old book?

"Mastand's 'Land of Illusion,' the greatest hithual novel of all time. You had an iron grip on it... So we kept it." Kraggon nicely stated.

All I could manage was a bewildered "Thanks yas fer hangin' on to it.... Friends." I opened up to the first page, and I read:

"Carnath was a young hithual with wisdom and talent. A man with a mission. But not just any mission. He wanted to rule the world. Create a new world. The boy had ideas so radical he wasn't considered a normal person, but a believer of a lost cause. His friends followed him like a cult. Watching how he moved, and how he talked. And he was just a dreamer, lost in his fantasies."

Attack at the Lair
By Feste DeOlivia

The sun shown brightly in the summer of the year 313. The smell of flowers blooming and life beginning left a beautiful smell all around the Spur. Feste the Secian sat outside the Gilded Lion Inn, watching nature at its fullest. Underneath the shade tree, light strained through, projecting odd patterns on the floor and the surrounding areas. Feste layed back casually, staring up at the sky, wings folded on his back. A light breeze blew through the sanctuary of the tree, bringing a calming feeling through the area so that the Secian closed his eyes and fell gently to sleep. But after a few minutes, he was awoken by a tiny monarch butterfly that flew through the leaves and landed on his forehead. Smiling, he looked up at the tiny butterfly whose wings were fluttering slightly. Suddenly, the tranquil peace of the shade tree was disturbed with the sounds of a Dragon crying out in pain. Jumping to his feet, the butterfly flew off his forehead, off into the distance as the Secian sent out a mental link message to the fellow Secians asking, "What's happening?"

Soon, another Secian's voice was heard in his head saying, "Dracon the Dragon is staging! Suddenly, he just stumbled down in TS!"

At this, Feste invoked a translocation aura and dissappeared in a rainbow shimmer as the white aura surrounded him. As he appeared in Town Square, the form of a hunched over Dragon could be seen. Two Dragons seemed to be bracing him up to a standing position so he could get to the Lair. Around the hunched over form was the small figure of a Secian, runes circling over his head and surrounding Dracon. Unfortunately, the figure of the Dragon didn't seem to be changing much and a distinct paleness stayed on the humanoid form. Suddenly, a huge flapping of leathery wings could be heard in the distance and in a few moments, the huge forms of second stage and third stage Dragons landed in TS. The sheer size of the Dragons were breathtaking. Their shadows enveloped all of TS in darkness, like the moon blocking the sun during a solar eclipse. The Dragons, holding some device to carry wounded people, specially strengthened for heavy weights, picked up the body of Dracon and placed him on the device. And with one graceful motion downward, their wings propelled them in the air, holding the body of the staging Dracon as they flew southward to the Lair. Closely following the flying Dragons were several other Dragons and Secians.

After a couple of minutes, the band of Dragons and Secians had reached the entrance to the Lair. As they wandered through the entrance led by the Dragons, the Secians gazed up, staring in awe. The flying Dragons then landed and placed the staging Dragon on the floor. At this, the young chosen Secian went on helping his Dragon, keeping him barely alive. Suddenly, the Dragon screamed out in pain as the stubs of wings started to protrude from his back and a crowd of gasps followed. A faint blue glow could barely be seen, surrounding only the Secian and the Dragon.

At this moment, a hoarse screaming sound could be heard outside the entrance to the lair. As the Dragons peered outside, a hoard of Thugians, Oog-ra and Go-blins could be seen emerging from the path, heading to the lair, all with weapons unsheathed. At this, the Dragons readied their weapons and soon shields and armor glinted in the sun. As the enemy approached closer, runes began to circle above the heads of the Dragons and Secians. Suddenly, the first line, comprised of Oog-ra were entangled in magickal webs, leaving them unharmed and harmless. But, the first line was soon bowled over by a huge crowd of Thugians who rushed towards the Dragons. After resisting the first attack by the Thugians, the Dragons flanked them from the left and right, encircling them so means of escape was nearly impossible. But, as the Thugians sustained massive damage, they were suddenly brought into a massive berserker fury, blood curdling war cries being let out everywhere. This unsuspected attack forced the Dragons into the lair where their Secians soon healed their wounds.

Now, the staging Dragon had grown full wings and was crying in pain. But the Dragons couldn't stand still for too long as the crowd outside the Lair had re-assembled and attacked once again. Fortunately, the Dragons had just enough time to invoke some spells and a volley of lightning storms, acid webs and fire auras were hurled at the Thugians. Unable to withstand the power of the runespells, many fell laying dead, corpses soon littered the area. Seeing this, the rest of the crowd ran forward, hoping to overwhelm the Dragons by sheer number. As the huge crowd of remaining creatures ran forward, the Dragons backed up, through the entrance to the Lair, hoping to reduce the amount they had to fight at a time. Using this tactic and pulling out long-spears, the Dragons thrust cold steel through uncovered flesh, spewing blood from a safe distance. As the Go-blins realized their numbers depleting, they scurried away, cowards as they are. Then, the sun began to set, shadowing the black drying blood in the ground around the Lair. The Dragons then sheathed their weapons and went back inside, victorious for the day. And inside the huge Lair, a blue glow emanated, surrounding the walls and highlighting everyone around the Dragon and Secian bonding. Then, huge claws protruded from the hands of the Dragon and the skin turned slightly tougher. At this, the new 2nd stage Dragon stood up, spreading out his wings and let out a tremendous roar which echoed around the cavern then slowly dissipated. Soon, the sounds of cheers rang through the air as the Dragon and Secian completed their bond.

The Shape Shifter
By Feste DeOlivia

Thales Miletus had been feared and wondered about for as long as he could remember. As he came from his mothers womb, he appeared like any other normal human child, but something was terribly wrong. As the midwife set him down, wrapped in a warm, cotton blanket, she noticed a small scar underneath his chin. Under further inspection, she noticed it was the sign of the Lords of Chaos. At this, she gasped and ran in fear as the recovering mother stared in wonderment and inquisitiveness. The mother then picked up her child, holding him close to her, then inspected him where the midwife seemed to be looking. But, the tiny scar had mysteriously disappeared into thin air, leaving no trace of the sign that had stricken fear into the midwife's heart. The mother then shrugged and placed the child in a crib made of fine ebony and lined with soft, fluffy blankets. At this time, the sun had begun to set and the mother went to sleep, leaving her child at what she thought was pleasant sleep. In the night, the young child had a nightmare, releasing his then uncontrollable power. At the moment of thought, the child turned into a huge Thugian, arms, legs and whole body growing in huge proportions, shattering the strong ebony of the crib. The mother then leaped from her bed, thinking her child was in trouble. But, the child soon became calm again and returned to its baby state, with bars and splinters of wood laying conspicuously on the ground. The mother then came running to her child's side and looked puzzled as she saw he lay undisturbed. Frowning, she picked up her child and blankets and placed them in her room so she could keep an eye on him. Sleep overcoming her, she lay down softly in her bed as her eyelids slowly rested in place and deep sleep was eminent.

As Thales grew up, he learned the basic arts of thievery, sharp weapons and slight channeling experience. Thales grew up as a thief, helping his mom in her skilled arts. At thirteen years of age, Thales was accepted as a proud thief under the temple of Set. Staring up at the acolyte, he looked curious as the acolyte took a red, steaming piece of steel and placed it up against the young boy's cheek, branding him with the sign of Set. This deed made Thales scream in anger and he couldn't control his anger, morphing into the form of an aged Muatana-al in mid-bloodlust. Thales howled grabbing the acolyte by his robes. The acolyte screamed in pain and fainted, head and body rolling down as if life had been sucked out of him. But, life hadn't been sucked out of him yet.. err.. nevermind, the Muatana-al then siphoned the health of the acolyte, and dropped him on the floor as the hunger was satisfied. Then, realizing he had a sword at his side, unsheathed it, readied it and swung at the acolyte, severing of it's head. Now, the Muatana-al had attracted the attention of all in the temple and most were collecting weapons in an attempt to ward off the creature of Chaos. But as his anger subsided, young Thales shifted back into a humanoid form, kneeling on the floor, panting from exhaustion. Lifting his head, Thales saw the crowd of Set followers edging towards him. He screamed and ran out of the temple as quickly as he could. Looking back, he saw a crowd of angry Setites running towards him screaming, "Get the demon!" 

Thales had never been referred to as a demon before. His mom would call him insolent and other insults, but he knew she didn't mean it. The only praise he had ever received was when he returned from a successful pickpocket or stole something of value, in which his mom received him as worthy of her name. These moments Thales cherished the most. Remembering these times, Thales ran, his small feet pulling up the dirt from the path in a huge cloud behind him. Suddenly, he heard a whizzing sound flow by his face and a sharp pain like that when he was branded went across his cheek. They were firing arrows at him! A tiny amount of blood splurged from his graze, dropping down and plopping in the dirt. But the blood was soon absorbed by the dirt and covered as the crowd running after Thales tread through it. A few more arrows flew through the air, but Thales was ready and dodged them with the finesse that would have made his mother proud. One arrow that whizzed past him flew harmlessly into a tree, making a thud as the metal tip sunk into the bark. Another arrow flew off the mark and sank down and into the dust. Thales wiped a bead of sweat from his brow and then noticed that the path before him was running short, heading for a cliff. But it was too late, there was no place to go, only to the edge of the cliff. Cornered like a mouse in a maze with a cat close on his tail, Thales shivered in fear. As the crowd of Setites ran towards him, he looked back at the cliff and then back towards the wave of people. But before he could do anything, a blunt spear was hurled at him, knocking him on the head and unconscious. On impact, Thales felt darkness approaching and stumbled down in a cloud of dust. 

Hearing the sounds of hoarse voices, Thales opened his eyes, not realizing where he was for a few seconds. As he lifted up his head, a sharp pain went through his neck and he placed his head down harshly on the ground again. His whole body ached as if all his bones were broken and a Monitanian had taken a lead hammer and pounded on every muscle of his body. As his body left it's numb state, he realized his hands were tied in front of him, ropes digging harshly into his flesh and soaked black from his blood. Thales then attempted to stand up, but as he arched his back and braced his arms underneath him, he felt a sharp kick on his spine and a thud was heard as he fell to the ground again. "Lay still demon!" a raspy voice told him.

Thales looked up and around him, noticing only five people standing guard around him. Two men were having a conversation about him near-by. He decided to listen in.
"What should we do with it?" the first voice said.
"We should throw it off the cliff immediately and inform it's mother that some accident took place." the second voice said.
"Maybe he could prove useful to us someday," the first voice said.
"We shouldn't take the chance. It's most likely to revolt against us. I say crush it before it can crush us." barked the second voice.
"Your right. Lets through it off the cliff and forget about it." responded the first voice reluctantly.

Suddenly, Thales felt a pull on his shoulders by two hairy hands which lifted him to his feet. 
"Let's get this over with." said the voice of the first person. Thales took one last look around him and saw his sword and sheath on a table about 20 feet away from him. If only he could get a distraction to get his sword and cut the ropes. Then he'd show them. As if the gods were listening, a huge aging yelican ran in from the forest and the men ran to fight it, dropping him on the ground. Thales then thanked Set and stood up, then ran over to the table. Lifting his leg, he sent it crashing down on the table, breaking the flat surface and the sword slipped out of the sheath and onto the moist grass. Thales then dived towards the blade, hands tied with ropes in front of him. Using the sharp edge of the blade, he rubbed the ropes up against it, looking back anxiously. The men were still busy with the yelican. As the rope frayed to a few more strands, with a jerking motion outwards, Thales ripped them apart and the confining rope fell harmlessly to the ground. He then grabbed the sword and sheath, strapping it to his left side then readying the sword. At this time, one of the men ran a sword through the yelican's chest. Recuperating from the fight, the men looked around for Thales who was nowhere to be found. But from behind a shrubbery, the young Thales hid, fingering the hilt of his sword. As one man cautiously approached the shrubbery he was hidden in, he sucked in, holding his breath as to not make the slightest sound. The man, not hearing a thing, turned around and at this moment, Thales leapt from the bush lunging his blade through the man's spine and punctured the back of his heart and through the front of his chest. Staring at the blade, the man tried to gasp but the blade had punctured his lung and he was unable to inhale. Thales then thrust his blade from the man and he fell to the floor as the sword bracing him up was removed. 

The four others heard him fall and turned looking for Thales, but he had slipped behind a different bush, leaving a slight rustle in the leaves as if a breeze had flown through the area. Unfortunately, the four had noticed the rustle and went forward to inspect it. Thales then leaped from the bushes, swinging his blade, hoping to sever life from their necks. The first person didn't see it coming and fell with a spray of blood from his neck. Fortunately, the three others had time to react and dodged the blow easily. Now, all three ran at him. Thales lunged his blade forward and pierced through one of their chests, but the two others came at him too fast, using their sheer weight to overcome him and he was unable to dodge. Suddenly, he was knocked back and the grip on his sword loosened and let go, as his sword lay lodged in the chest of the man he had just slain. The two on top of him, held him firmly by the arms and legs and dragged the struggling Thales towards the cliff. The two, then hurled the body of Thales over the cliff, glad to be rid of the demon. 

Thales felt an exhilarating and frightening sensation grip him then. Who wouldn't after been thrown over a cliff? But, Thales leaned his body towards the cliff, trying to grab onto a branch or rock protruding from the side. Grabbing desperately, his body suddenly hit a rock protruding, knocking the breath out of him. Gasping as his inertia threw him downward after a sudden stop, Thales thanked Set that he was finally stopped. Looking down then up, Thales then realized he had a huge journey ahead of him. Looking down, the ground seemed extremely far away, and the trees below just small green dots gathered together in an amorphous green blob. Then looking up, all he saw was rock, only a little indents and extensions. At this time, he wished he could fly and suddenly wings protruded from his back and he was turned into an Anthian! Spreading his wings, Thales soared downward aiming for a blue, winding object, which he hoped was a river. The glory of soaring like a bird enthralled Thales. The wind flowing through his hair, wings holding him up, the sensation was so great. After a couple of minutes of soaring, Thales had flown over the river in which he could see fish swimming through the transparency of the clear water. He then lifted himself into an upright position, returning to normal form, splashing in the river, and making all the fish scurry in opposite directions. 

Pulling himself onto the shore and out of the river, he shook himself, spraying water all over the place. Thales then set off into the woods, reluctant to head back home. After a few hours, his stomach started growling, having only eaten breakfast that morning. Right then, he wished for a nice juicy steak and a warm glass of milk. Then, a rustling came from a bush and a small white bunny came running out. Ravenous, Thales ran after it, sword in hand, hoping to get his dinner. Following the white flash through the forest, Thales ran swiftly after it. Over and under logs, through brushes, around trees and through straight aways. And just as he thought he was about to catch it, he ran into someone. Looking up, he saw the white bunny run away and into a hole. 
"Dang it!" the ravenous Thales cried.

Then, the figure he bumped into stood up. But Thales was too angry to notice and sat there, pondering how he could ever catch something to eat. Then, the figure let out it's hand in a motion of friendliness. Now, Thales, as if awakened from a dream looked up, viewing the most beautiful thing he had ever seen in his whole life. Above him stood a young sandy haired, brown eyed, female Fir Elf forester. Garbed in brown, worn leather, she made a truly impressive sight to the young Thales. "Need help?" she asked with out stretched hand. 

"Sure," Thales replied, still stunned and then stuck out his hand.

With a strong grip, she pulled him up, stronger than he expected and he was propelled forward into her. Blushing, Thales backed up.

"Who are you? Where are you from? I haven't seen you in this neck of the woods." the Fir Elf inquired.

Cautiously, Thales paused for a second, thinking of a suitable story. After a few seconds, one came to him, albeit not a very good one and he replied, "Well, I was a young mercenary, hired to kill large creatures terrorizing the lands. But, when I killed all the bad things in the lands, I had to find another profession."

The Fir Elf laughed and said, "Really? You look a little young for a mercenary."

Thales wrinkled his nose and said, "Well, you don't look like one either!"

The Fir Elf smiled saying, "I never claimed that I was."

At this remark, Thales stood thinking of something to say, but nothing came to mind. Thales then said, "I am a mercenary! I'll prove it to you!"

Then, the Fir Elf pulled a blunt wood knife out of a small sheath mounted on her left forearm and lunged at the unsuspecting Thales, tagging him straight on his left breast and if it had been a sharp weapon, it would have pierced his heart. "There, you aren't really a mercenary. Now tell me the truth." said the Fir Elf.

"Well, truthfully, I'm a thief named Thales" began Thales. Then, the Fir Elf, believing he was lying swung at him. Thales saw it coming and ducked, wooden blade whizzing above his head.

"Really! I am!" Thales cried showing her the mark of Set on his cheek.

"Continue then," she said.

"Well, I was becoming a thief of Set and I was branded. It hurt a lot and I felt an evil strength gripping me. The next thing I knew, the acolyte was laying on the floor, head cut off, and a crowd of people with swords were coming towards me. So I did what anyone would do, I ran. And that would bring me here, trying to catch food when I bumped into you," Thales recalled, leaving off the part where they threw him off a cliff and he flew, thinking she might think he was crazy.

"If you needed food, you could have just asked," the forester said, reaching into her pouch and pulling out a few herbs.

"You eat leaves?!" Thales said astonished.

"One, their not leaves, their herbs. And two, of course I do, do you think I eat meat?" The Fir Elf asked.

"Well.. why not?" Thales asked curiously and still astonished.

"You've got a lot too learn," said the Fir Elf smiling as she led him off deeper into the forest.

Later, Thales learned that the Fir Elf's name was Alaria. She had been taught the ways of the forest at a very young age. When she was around nine, her village was sacked by a wandering band of Thugian barbarians. Although they put up a worthy fight, due to lack of arrows, the Fir Elves lost when forced to fight hand to hand with the brutish Thugians. Fortunately, a bunch of Fir Elf children had been sent out into the forest with a few female adults and weren't harmed. This group formed a small colony in a cave in the forest, as it provided very good natural protection just in case they were to be raided again. This is where Alaria brought Thales. 

The cave was well guarded, a huge mountain of nearly impenetrable rock. The mouth of the cave was cleverly guarded by weeping willows that hung over the entrance. In front of these were large rocks, with several holes for shooting arrows and looking through. She then led him into the cave, pushing the leaves of the willows away briefly so they could get through. The interior was lit by huge blazing lanterns, that illuminated the room in an orange yellow color, making weird shadows appear on the cavern walls.

"I'm the last of my kind," she said sighing.

"The rest of them died off from a sickness several years ago, although how I escaped from it, I don't know." Alaria continued.

She then walked over to a rack of weapons. The rack was made of wood and suspended on the wall somehow. Several weapons forged of iron lay in place, but most were the finest long bows one could ever lay eyes upon. The wood was shaped perfectly, made for optimum balance between strength and flexibility. Strong horse hair was strung on the bow, but when pulled back, allowed the greatest amount of tension to shoot an arrow swiftly and with great strength to its target. Grabbing one of these bows, she walked over to another wall where several quivers full of arrows hung. Grabbing one of these strapped, leather pouches with iron tipped wooden arrows, she walked over to Thales and handed them to him. She then led him over to some practice targets shaped like various animals and people. Pointing at a target shaped like a regular human, she said, "Shoot it."

Thales smirked, then strung an arrow to his bow. Then, he tried to pull the bow string back, but it wouldn't budge. Alaria laughed at the young human and smiled watching him struggle. Frustrated, Thales cried, "This is impossible! The string won't budge an inch!"

Alaria then walked over to the human, readied her bow, strung an arrow, and shot, arrow sinking straight into the head of the target. Thales gaped and asked, "How'd you do that?"

She then strapped her bow to her back and walked over to Thales. Holding his left hand, she placed it on the front of the bow. Then, she placed his right hand on the string saying, "Now, just relax and pull the string back. Become one with the bow, look carefully at your target, then release the string when the tension is just right."

Now, Thales pulled back the string, shooting an arrow straight towards the target and into it's right leg. "I hit it!" Thales said, hopping up and down. 

"Fairly good shot, try again, and aim for the head" the forester said.

Thales then strung another arrow and shot for the practice target's head. The arrow soared through the air, missed by a slim margin and flew into the wall of the cave. This continued for about an hour, Thales missing, hitting different body parts when finally, the arrow was correctly guided and sank into the soft stuffing of the target's head. 

Alaria clapped, then guided Thales over to a target of a small rabbit. "Now, hit that." she said smiling. Again, Thales shot for several hours, then tiring, he lay down his bow and quiver of arrows. 

"Why are you stopping?" the Fir Elf asked.

"Because I'll never get it." Thales replied.

"Well of course you'll never get it if you don't try." Alaria replied.

Realizing that she was right, he picked up the bow and quiver and started again. On his first shot, he let the arrow flow and hit the target easily. "Again," the forester said.

Thales then knocked an arrow, then let it fly, splitting his first arrow. "Impressive," the Fir Elf said smiling.

Thales and Alaria then practiced together for several years, living together, hunting together. They got to know each other, their likes, desires, fears, pleasures and soon fell in an odd sort of love. After their third year together, Alaria found she was pregnant with Thales' child. But, Thales hadn't told her yet of his secret. 

By now, Thales' mom had thought him dead. For when he didn't come back that day, she got suspicious and went looking for him. Then, she got word from the two men who threw him off the cliff. They told her that the temple had been attacked by Taathians who killed all they could. Of course, she believed them but hoped they were wrong. For several months, she mourned for her son's supposed death, praying to Set every night that he would come back to her. 

Now, Thales felt a necessity to return home. Saying good-bye to Alaria, he headed off. But, Alaria didn't plan to sit and wait for him, so she hid the weapons and blocked the cave with heavy boulders. Satisfied, she headed off, tracking Thales. Several weeks passed, but Thales finally reached his home town. The town had changed a lot since he had last been there. Temples had fallen and rebuilt in different sections, more houses had been erected, stores had closed and went away, and the woods had been cut down significantly for town growth. Sucking in a breath of air, Thales headed to where his mother's house used to be. When he got there, he immediately noticed his house. It hadn't changed for the several years he had been gone. But, signs of weather and wear showed in the roof where patches of sticks and leaves had been slovenly placed. Thales walked up to his house, then knocked on the door. Inside he heard the sounds of soft footsteps and then a voice called out, "Who is it?"

It was his mother's voice of course. Thales responded, "It is your son, Thales!"

The voice who had lost hope said, "My son's been dead for three years, but if you're looking for alms then come in"

Then, his mother opened the door and stared at the form in front of her. Then, she gasped as she saw the exact face of the son she had thought lost so many years ago. Leaping forward, she wrapped her arms around her son, tears flowing endlessly from her eyes. By chance, the two men who had thrown him off the cliff were walking by and saw the young man with his mother.

"It can't be?!" said the first man.

"Is it him? How could he have survived?" the second man said aghast.

Now, the two were determined to get rid of him. They grabbed a bow and a quiver of arrows each and headed for a suitable place to take out Thales. The two men had strung their bows, and from the roof of a house near Thales', they stood waiting. Thales and his mom, still hugging had no idea what was happening around them. Now, the first man took a shot at Thales, missing him and hitting the front door. This immediately alerted Thales and he looked around, looking for the shooter. "Get inside mom!" he cried.


At this, his mom ran inside and Thales saw his would be assassins. He then pulled out his bow, strung it and let an arrow fly. The arrow's head, nearly perfectly guided struck one man in the chest. The man, gasping, fell off the roof and landed hard on the ground, but the impact wasn't felt as life had already been taken from him. The second man, seeing Thales stringing another arrow, shot at him. A very lucky shot indeed, as it struck Thales in the chest, knocking him off balance backwards and hitting the door. The shot killed him. But from the woods, Alaria had appeared, and seeing Thales go down, pulled out her bow. From about 100 yards, she shot her arrow. As would be expected of a forester, the arrow sunk into the flesh of his head, piercing his brain. The man stumbled, falling down onto the roof which couldn't support his weight plus the momentum of his falling. Now, the roof had caved in, leaving a surprised couple underneath.

Alaria ran to Thales, but as she saw him, she knew it was too late. 

A few months later, Alaria brought the son of Thales into the world. This child was given the same powers as his father. He was in fact, an Alarian.

Questions or Deceptions
By Johnny Bravo

Watching you sleep
I see your dreams
colorful and mystical
I see your heart.

You don't think I got that far
you don't know that I see
that you're not sure that 
what's in your heart is me.

I can live without love
I can live being here
spending the time with you
but can you?

Honestly, can you keep living
with me without love?
Without my heart matching
yours and me being in there?

I worry all that time
that this will be over
but I keep in my fears
because I don't want to lose you.

My heart says we're meant to be
but you dodge the issue 
going silent again. It's not the 
way lovers are meant to act.

When I sleep, when I dream
I wonder what you see.
My heart so colorful and so mystical
or don't you know?

Second Thoughts
By Johnny Bravo

I'm getting too old to play these games.
I'm getting too old to say these lines.
I'm not getting wiser, I'm not growing.

Circles. I go in circles.
Passing the same four walls each time
on this endless and hapless walk.

I have to end this dream time.
Come on out into the real world
for the time to grow up and be old and gray.

Wings.
Fly.
Dreams.
Die.

These are the dreams that we play.

Mindless Rantings By The Lazy One
By Esper Esperchan (AKA puffball…gods, I love Editorial power)

Esper staggers in, staff thumping heavily on the floor. After straigtening his portrait of Allandra on the wall, he collapses on a nearby sofa. Fishing in his pack for several minutes and uncovering half a dozen broken quills, he growls and stomps over to his desk, grabbing a quill and parchment, then collapsing on the sofa again.

Marigold just entered from a worn oak door.

Marigold says, "Esper, I need those interviews!"

Marigold hops up and down.

Esper says, "Alright, Marigold. I'll get right on it."

Marigold says, "Thanks."

Marigold just went through a worn oak door.

Esper says, "Blah blah, need the interviews, blah blah blah nag nag!"

Esper's mood is now flaming-mad.

Esper stands up, and grabbing a nearby board, starts beating a sack of potatoes put there for exactly that purpose.

Esper mumbles something and stalks over to his desk, pushing aside several large piles of paper, most notably the interviews.

Esper says, "Marigold was supposed to do those anyway, but nooooooo.."

Esper says, "I have to do everything! I haven't even SEEN Frason or Aubrei doing anything but lazing about, much less writing articles!"

Esper scowls.

Esper says, "On top of that, we're doing daily news now! Just what I need! More deadlines!"

Esper's mood is now black.

After several minutes of mumbling and ranting, Esper finally sits down to doing the Society Column.

Dear Spurians..

We have two lovely pieces for you this week. The following is "Hunter's Moon," a landslide win by Marigold.


Ten years ago this very eve,
Three brothers went a-hunting,
And left behind three wives so fair,
Three babes wrapped all in bunting;
With bows slung 'cross their ample backs,
And hearts as high as sinners,
Set off to fell a wild boar
And fetch it home for dinner.
Into a forest thick they marched
As silent as a stalker;
As careful as a trembling lamb
Creeps past a midnight walker.
Further deep and further in
They found their place of ambush,
A grove of still and stalwart trees
Which rose from thorny brambles.
The men slipped into hiding
And prepared to wait the day-
Their hound picked up a chipmunk's scent
And promptly dashed away.
The minutes turned to hours
And the hours dragged into dusk,
Still the hunters made no single kill-
No meat, or hide, or tusk.
The sun sank to the bowels of earth,
The wind made shadows quiver;
To see the spidery branches dance,
One could not help but shiver.
And one by one they came aware
Of the scent this forest bore-
The rancid, sweet, and sickening smell
All too much like a corpse.
The barking of a hunter's dog
Broke through the eerie silence,
Abrupt and, true, quite welcome,
With a nigh-relieving violence.
The hunting brothers stayed their ground,
Far more concerned with pig than whelp,
And knowing that their trusted pup
Was in no need of human help.
An hour later, full moon rising,
The eldest brother stood
To suggest that they should start back home-
They'd done as best they could.
But outside in the clearing,
He found a horrid sight
Of blood that splashed and glimmered
In the night sky's pallid light.
Stretched and gutted on the crimson turf
Lay a dog, with rended head-
And sprawling there beside him
Were the two young brothers-dead.
The eldest stared about in fear,
For signs, or prints, or tracks,
But found the snarling, sharp-toothed beast
Was standing at his back.
He turned and faced the vile thing,
A warg crouched to the ground,
And just before it killed the man,
It bayed-just like a hound.
The searchers found no sign of life
Save for their bloodstained bones,
Though they say that here, deep in the night,
You sometimes hear the moans...
So if upon a lonely eve,
You sense a hollow baying,
I bid you take to shelter fast,
For somewhere...it is waiting.


Wonderful, Marigold. And how appropriate for our slightly postponed All Hallow's eve recitals. 
[MoC Note: Demon troubles.]

Next is a wonderful Spur of the Moment poem by Leily. The topic was "Glowheads"

What can you do with a Glowhead,
When he no longer glows?
Why, you can use him as a raft,
If you're ever pulled below.
He also makes a nice chair,
When you lazy in Town Square,
Or you can teach him to be a barber,
And have him style your hair.
But most importantly,
You must never let him go,
'Cause he may come back to get you,
Then, EEK! You're glowed!
Becuase if a glowhead doesn't glow,
That doesn't mean he can't,
It just means he's out to find someone new,
That he can easily enchant.


Be sure to attend the recitals next week!

Esper

Marigold yells, "Esper, Cmere! I need you!"

Esper rolls his eyes.

The True Story
By Marigold Lyrian

Ok…I just got that snide little submission from Esper, and I couldn't help but…::cough:: add a little something of my own.  For those interested, here is the way things really happen.

Marigold just entered through a worn oak door.

Marigold glances at Esper, who is snoring listlessly on his overstuffed sofa, which he has so thoughtfully hauled into the middle of the office.

Marigold leans over and thwacks Esper on the snout.

Esper groans, "Naww, mom, I don't waaaaaaana go to obedience school today…"

Esper whines.  His extremely voluminous belly fat quivers.

Marigold snickers.

Esper blinks his eyes open and stares up at Marigold.

Marigold says, "Esper, you were supposed to have those interviews in to me THIS MORNING."

Esper furrows his brow.

Marigold says, "Or did you forget?"

Marigold stares at the 23 empty glasses of rum punch.

Esper coughs.

Esper says, "I…uhhh…I have em done, I just, sorta…forgot to…turn them in to you."

Marigold reaches over to Esper's desk and picks up a stack of papers.  To her horror, thousands of pages come fluttering to the ground!

Marigold groans.

"Esper…you used that bloody AUTOSCRIBE again, didn't you?"

Newt's Tale
By Mebok

Mebok the Newt stood upon a large rock in an alley facing Spur's Town Square. He blinked at the gathering crowd of people. There seemed to be a lot of commotion, probably about what would be going on this winter as it was already fall. They also were talking about something called "the Lords of Chaos" but to Mebok, much like most anything he hears, this is only a faint recollection of what he knew in his past life. Mebok yawned, then decided to see if he could sneak in to Town Square and find any left over tidbits of food to eat. He thought this should be easy due to the commotion. Having learned before that walking into to Town Square out in the broad daylight would get him killed, as there have been several previous attempts on his life. He jumped off the rock he was perched on and darted to a pile of raked leaves sitting just outside the alley. He made it there without being noticed, Mebok thought to himself "Hah, these stupid peoples ain't ganna catch me today!" That was another thing, when Mebok was not being chased after to be killed, there were secians and other races trying to catch him and drag him around Town Square, often ending up running into a Arach or someone who wanted to kill him for some arcane reason. But in the end, Mebok always got some form of food out of it. Just as Mebok was preparing to move to another pile of leaves, he heard something. A scraping sound made Mebok peek out of the leaf pile with his small beady eyes. Then he saw it! A large cockroach wondered next to the leaf pile where he was hiding. One word came to his mind.... DINNER! He dropped into a pounce position, copying how a cat or Leuian would spring at something, and dived onto the cockroach! He clamped his jaws over its thorax and pummeled it to death. Mebok then jumped up and down saying "food food food!", a gleam of pride in his eyes. As he was eating his meal, a shadow appeared behind him unbeknownst and a large jar slammed over him! Mebok let out a shriek as he looked up through the jar at his captor.... It was Webber the Arachnian! He grinned at Mebok through the jar, sharp mandibles snapping. Mebok started screaming "'ELP!!!, let me go let me go!!", but the Arachnian just put a lid on the jar and threw him into a dark pouch. Then as the Arachnian began to move somewhere in a quickened pace Mebok's jar was tossed around in the pouch bouncing around things. As soon as Mebok's head cleared and he had a chance to look around with his night vision at the contents of the pouch he gasped. He now and a idea of what the Arachnian wanted him for. Under and around the jar were various spell components from lizard tails to whole rotting rat corpse! Mebok yelled "let me out you bully!" and started shrieking some more. Then everything stopped.... had the Arach listened to Mebok? The flap came open and Webber peered inside. He then let out a gutteral laugh and sprinkled some kind of dust over the vent holes in the jar and a tired ness came over Mebok and he was soon asleep. Mebok awoke being dumped out of a jar and into a small aquarium filled with water. Mebok then dove to the bottom and tried burrowing himself under the rocks that had been placed at the bottom. Webber chuckled the hissed "trying to hide newt?, well I don't care how you spend the last few hours of your life!" "For soon you shall be a spell component!" Mebok's eyes opened wide in horror and continued to try and burrow into the rocks. Then a thought came over him... "If I no escape dis, I die fo' good!". Yes even Mebok, not a catapult scientist, knew he some how had to get out or he was history. He then swam up to the top of the aquarium and surveyed his surroundings while keeping a study paddle to keep afloat. While Mebok was indeed a Amphibian, he was a magical one.... not requiring water to keep his skin moist like most newts did.. he was just always.. slimy. 

Mebok then looked to the top of the aquarium.. it was a simple lid.. no lock what so ever on it... only problem was, was that the water only filled half the aquarium. Mebok felt he was doomed and sunk to the bottom waiting for the Arach to return and for his fate. Then he heard approaching foot steps, the evil Arachnian approached and hissed "Now don't you go no where newtie!" He then chuckled to himself and exited through the door. Mebok scowled and muttered "o ya?! We see what 'appen meanie!" Mebok then started throwing small stones at the glass hoping to break it, this he tried for a few minutes to no avail. 

He then floated over to one end of the aquarium and decided he might as well just lay down and wait for the evil spider to return. Mebok, not one who enjoys sleeping on rocks started to shove the rocks on the left side of the aquarium to the right, clearing a space for him to sit down on the smooth surface. He then saw a shiny glint from atop the pile of rocks in the corner he swam to the top and climbed to the top of the pile of rocks now protruding the water a few inches and looked at a piece of rock that appeared to be made of gold. "Ah... shiny stone...." he said to himself eyeing the rock. 

Mebok always did love anything that glinted or shined, and had more then once been chased after be a knight who had noticed his ceremonial dagger missing and noticed it on the ground being towed behind a small red newt! Usually there was a secian or some kind person there to explain to the enraged individual that Mebok was merely looking at it and did not mean to steal it.

 Mebok then realized something. He was no longer in the water! He then looked up to the roof of the ceiling and noticed that it was closer to him then before "Hmmmm" Mebok thought to himself, "if me take all des woks and stack them over here, me soon get ramp ting and me be free from ebil spider!!" Mebok then dove back into the water and started pushing the rocks to the other end... soon his ladder to escape would be complete!  He soon had reached the top and removed the lid to the aquarium and dropped to the floor below. Mebok grinned, "heh heh, no tupid spider ganna eat dis newt!"

 He then headed towards a door he took was the door out of the building, Mebok, not having use for doors, easily squeezed under the door frame and popped up on the other side and let out a gasp. "Shinney things....". What then met his eyes was Webber the Arachnian's coin room... while to some people, the few thousand mixed coins may not have seemed much, but to a 6" Newt.. it was about more shiny things then he had ever seen! Mebok smiled to himself. "Wit dis much money I can buy  me the bird fam I always wanted!" Mebok had always wanted a bird fam.. particularly a large raven he always went to look at when he passed the fam shop, Mebok always was amazed with birds and flight, and he thought if he had a raven fam he'd be able to ride it and fly around the world! But alas, he never had the money for such a fam... but now he saw a chance to get one... and teach that spider some manners. But one problem presented itself... 

"Now how I ganna get all dis money to do fam shop?!"  "Carry it one by one to da store?" "Nah.. take too much time." "Get someone to take it dere for mes?" "nopes.. dat wont work either, day just take it again"  Mebok scowled remembering when he asked a thug to help him carry a chest of coins to his lair(A large hollowed out log by the far southern gate of Spur, he called it a " lair" because he also thinks dragons are the coolest thing and often tried to act like a 4th stager when he came across a ant hill). But the Thugian took the chest as his own leaving Mebok with nothing. Mebok looked around the room for a object he could use to put the coins in. He then spied a chest. "No dat to big... dumb thug come along and take that too..." He then saw a small leather bag sitting near the table, hung on a hook. It was slightly bigger then him in dimensions and looked like it could hold a few coins to Mebok. Mebok then took it down and begin filling it with coins, not noticing that the bag was not getting any wider with the contents he was placing it. And not after long, all the coins in the room had been fit into the 6" X 6" Magical   Bag of holding(a bag that appears small but can hold up to 200 lbs. worth of objects, that when placed in it, shrink in size). Mebok then headed for the door out of the hut without any run-ins with Webber.

 Mebok then walked down the farm road dragging the bag behind him and soon reached the fam hut. There he saw a large dragon(we will call him Zuril) being chased through the corn field, several ears of corn in his hands, by a mad farmer! Mebok giggled to himself "Dat dragon eat too much!" he said nodding his head and slipped into Longbow's Fam shop. Longbow looked knowingly at Mebok,  having seen him several times here before. "How can I help you sir?" He asked with a smug grin. "I want to buy to buy da raven!" Mebok said jumping up and down. "With what?" Longbow replied eyes narrowing on the newt. "Wit dis!", Mebok said up turning his pouch and watching coin by coin by coin fall out. A grin spread across Longbow's face, "Would you like a harness with that?"   "You betcha!" Mebok said beaming.


Farindel the San elf and DraNoth the Psycian sat in Town Square playing a game of cards. "Ha!", DraNoth said, "You lose again tree hugger!" Farindel growled "Sure... I bet you used some glow bug ability too see which cards you had." He then handed DraNoth a small bag of coins. "Heh heh heh, care to play again old frie---
Suddenly a red and black blur flew between the two astonished players and zoomed North bound. Farindel babbled "Its a Bird.." DraNoth then cut in "Its a dragon" Then together they said in union "Mebok the newt on a raven?!"

The Search For Leuia
By Jaugar Panthergirl

As the sun set behind the ocean three figures stood on the beach looking at the ocean."Are you sure you want to do this" Alister asked me.Taalon a tall handsome leuian looked at me "he's got a point jaugar", Taalon said to me as he held my hand "I mean Alister is a Drag-Al and I don't think that they would let him in", Taalon frowned.Taalon and Alister had been friends science i'd met them.They never fought or anything."Well if you want to back out I'll understand,but I'm going to find Leuia and  then I'll find my parents"!.Then we all agreed that we'd go to leuia.Alister then explained that he'd get the boat.Taalon said he'd get some money.And I got the food.

The next morning the seas were calm.Alister showed us the boat.It was beautiful but small.As I saw on Taalon's face he was upset.When we got in the boat he sat in the corner and didn't say a word."What is wrong with Taalon", I asked Alister puzzled at Taalon's cold feelings."Im not sure", Alister told me "but maybe he's just tired he's been up all night".All of a sudden the bright blue skies turned dark and cloudy.The seas stared to roar with anger,then pretty soon we were in a terrible storm."Im lost", Taalon yelled "I don't know where to go"!.I looked in my bag and found a small agate necklace my parents gave me when I was a little kit.I placed the necklace on my neck.It felt warm on my cold and wet black fur.My head felt heavy and clouded."Go west", I yelled over the roaring of the angry seas.Alister turned the boat and we went west.But the storm stayed as bad as ever.I heard a noise under the boat.It was a strange noise.But then I looked up and saw a massive wave head towards us."JAUGAR"! Taalon yelled as the wave hit us with tremendous force.The water was dark and cold.The rain hit me hard I looked and yelled for Alister and Taalon.The waves hit my head and I was tired.Preety soon I went under.

When I came to I was on a sandy beach in the hot sun."I'm alive", I cheered myself.But then a grave thought entered my mind 
Alister and Taalon.

I wished and wished that they would come up running on the beach.I looked all over the beach.Untill dusk.I started to look around the island because I knew I was going to be there for a long time.But all these questions keep flooding my mind...

Where were Alister and Taalon?

Were they okay?

Were they wondering if I was okay?

Then as I looked I saw a sight that made my heart skip a beat
LEUIA I saw it,I was there."I made it"! I yelled happily as I ran towards the entrance to the pride.I stopped dead in my tracks.Taalon and Alister wanted to get to Leuia too! I was upset about that.I had to get it threw my head that Alister and Taalon were gone. Then when I got to the entrance I heard a soft voice call my name 

"Jaugar"

 No it couldn't be......

"TAALON,ALISTER"!! I yelled as I ran towards them.  Once inside the pride me and Taalon asked it Alister could stay and he could.later that night.The whole pride sat along a big bonfire as Taalon, Alister and I told them of our adventure.I leaned my head against Taalon and sighed.When the pride went to bed my mother came up to me and said "after all these years you came looking for us", She said as we walked together.When I got in the hut my mom and dad told me of how they left me in the training grounds.They also told me about my grandparents.
each day was happy and fun.  Taalon and Alister were still friends.  Taalon and I learned that we had become more that friends.
Was this it for my adventures?
I really can't say.
Only time will tell............

A Secret View Into The Life Of Monitanians
Blackcrow Twygg

My name is Blackcrow Twygg son of Wincesia Twygg and Aftertaste Twygg. I have written this article so that others will understand the life of the Monitanians. We are among the most secret of all races due to our communication disability, meaning we can only speak our own language, therefore having a secret world of our own. I have conducted many interviews with the oldest Monitanians I could find and the ones that knew the customs of our race. I also have added the many experiences of my life as well as the experiences of many others of my race. This can be used to guide the newly hatched citizens of Spur (A. K. A Monitanians coming from the Training Grounds). I have put all the things you could probably think of in here from SOR to mammals to royalty and even excerpts from interviews with Spurs most notorious lizards.. Please feel free to Spit at us any time. As you will learn, it means a sign of respect along with other things. All we lizards ask for is your respect and we will protect you for eternity. We all have the desire to protect the ones we can to the best of our ability sometimes we will go up against foolish odds just to prove our bravery in battle to others. I have seen some go up against impossible odds, I have went up against glowing skeletons which I could not even get close to hitting and later died from it. While you read this please note that these are the words of real Monitanians who protect all and have little care for those who kill others.
 
Female Domination
      
Female lizards rule over every male lizard, and therefore can only be ruled by older females. Males hunt as necessity and the females do it out of both necessity and instinct (mainly instinct). During hunting or any other time we must do what the females say, in the words of Jazbo, "Our job is to stand around and look cute while they do all the work" Personally I like the idea and have never met TOO many males who saw it differently. 
 
      
Females rule because in a time long ago and far away, there came together a great gathering of Monitanians in Monitan. They feasted and worshipped the gods for 6 days. On the seventh day, all of the leaders came together and had a test of wills. Some of the most challenging riddles and puzzles were presented. The contestants were eventually narrowed down to three females, and the final female, Kylara Twygg, was proclaimed Empress for her intellectual prowess and superiority. The other two finalists were made royal advisors.
 
Egotistic
      
The Monitanian race is well known for having a enormous ego when it comes to our hunting and fighting skills. The biggest egotists by far would be Jazbo and RCV. Ego is a common problem among us males of the race. I think its from the fact that males hunt for fun and necessity and not out of  instinct like the females. Males care how fast they kill but do not usually kill so they waste no meat. But, for the females hunting they like to destroy the ‘bad' part of the kill and save the good part for the lizards at home looking cute and picking out mammal skins. The males would starve to death if the females had as big of an ego as the males do.
 
Birth and Life
      
When a woman chooses her male life-mate she waits until she is fertile. She and her mate travel into a cave or swamp near Monitan and lay the eggs in a protected area. After 30 days the eggs will hatch primitive lizards. They walk on all fours and are as big as a Secian. Within several months, they will grow to a height from 5' to 7' and put on about 300+ pounds of muscle. They will never know who their parents are or even where there parents were born. After about 3 weeks after they had hatched they will wander away from the swamp. Many will find Monitan either by accident or by another Monitanian taking them there, but a few will wander into the wilderness and be killed. Perhaps they will wander into a wretch cave thinking it is the cave they were born in. The others in Monitan will take jobs in local villages. A select few will go to the palace and ask Empress Wincesia for permission to go to Spur to learn to be a warrior and gain intelligence. Once they are submitted as a citizen of Spur they will try to become an adopted child (well some of them) and take on the rituals to become adopted to the parents. They will be guided by their adopted parents and taught to live in a world full of dangers. They will be taught the proper ways to hunt and the customs of the Monitanians. To become an adopted child then you must immerse yourself in water for how ever long your prospective mom says. After you get out she will bite you a couple of times and set you off into Spur. If you are the adopted child you get no given titles; you must earn them like another Monitanians. If they do not decide to be adopted some other Monitanians will teach them or maybe they will pick it up themselves after seeing examples.
 
Hunting 
     
We Monitanians hunt for the pure fun (mostly the males do it for fun because as said before females hunt from instinct). We love to Spar to sharpen our skills and instincts, and to have fun. We have no care to kill ones we spar with; we just beat them hairless(if they're a mammal) and then Drag them to a healer. Usually after the Spar the mammal will try to finish off the lizard so we will have to kill them or beat them hairless and let them try to bleed to death again. If you are a fighter Monitanian you are probably going to want to want to kill things with a nice knife (Sharp) but if you are a barbarian you are probably likely to kill with a 2-handed pole weapon and standing a couple UDs away. As for being a runie, I do not think there are one too many of those around the Spur today. If you are a runie you will probably make like all runies and stand 5 UDs away and vigor and heal yourself. When females hunt they hunt for food to feed their family, "bringin' home the bacon", as we males fight for glory and waste any possible food to be around. I sure hope that the land never loses its three females or all the lizards will starve.
 
Mammal Haters

Monitanians A. K. A. lizards A. K. A. mammal killers, lovers, haters. Truthfully, only a few Monitanians hate mammals in a general sense. The fact that we may hate a mammal is not entirely due to the fact that they have hair covering their whole body is viewed as, well lets just say that hair is comfy to sleep on while resting in TS or after some of us berserk. I am fond of lots of mammals, I have also found that many other of us are proud to have them as friends. I find Psyclone and AngelStar the glower, who was to be my mother-in-law, amusing also the mammal that resurrected me for free and would not charge me for it. (I think it is because mammals are our servants.) Below, I have compiled a list of Monitanians' Favorite Mammals (or any race besides ours for that matter, because we are all friends)  for your viewing pleasure:
 
Blackcrow Twygg(Me) - "My favorite Dragon and Love Noble Amera Fitzgerald 
Psyclone, Angelstar, Flesh, Sordum, Craiger, Burk (I know we got some bad blood but I know its all good fun), Zuril, Shanz, Mogu, Araton (the runie one), Lykor, and any others I may have forgotten."
 
Ryia Monit -  "I respect the Hithual community."
                        
High Guard Noble Sir Jazbo Woondle - "Well, Buzzard is my brother "
 
Luminar Moonknight - "Aeris and Shanz."
 
Royal Consort Aftertaste Twygg - "Hypervel was a great friend of mine....Aros was 
too.....and Azulez"
 
Ogkay Clerio - "hmm... tough question, there are to many to count,"
 
Noble Baerqkra Dqualkaeir - "Smakem and Khain."
 
Empress Wincesia Twygg - "I have no reason to concern myself with mammalian   
friendships" but she did mention them being tasty.
 
Sonya Elderon - "Secians and Hithuals. They're just a free-spirited bunch."
 
The Lizards Monarchy
      
In Monitan we have an empress, just as all races a have a leader or leaders. The
present empress is Wincesia Twygg. Empress's are always the eldest female Monitanian in Spur. The Empress has many a job to do she must resolve debates and arguments, write and pass legislation, and have Jazbo enforce the laws. She also has to preside over ceremonies. If you really impress the empress in a way she will make you more than a loyal servant she will invest power in you. There are few lizards worthy of part of the empress's power which makes you rare to hold a spot in government. The spots that can be filled as of now are: High Guard - 1 spot. Regular Guard- Unlimited spots. Royal Consort - 1 spot (unless the empress decides to marry more than one). Currently the empress has only blessed 3 subjects for these positions. They are listed below--
 
High Guard Noble Sir Jazbo Woondle - High Guard
Royal Consort Aftertaste Twygg - Royal Consort
Guard Elsmere Drinkinabeer- Guard
 
Lizard Love
     
Like in all races, places, and cases everyone, even Jazbo, need companionship from other lizards or mammals (If you go out on a limb). Some of us are married as others go into a world of mammals alone. Some have fallen in and outta love and some in EVERLASTING relationships. Once you have found your life mate it is followed bites of affection and mingling of blood to be recognized by law you have to have a formal ritual and show that you want to be life mates. The male ALWAYS takes the females name because, as you should know, we are female dominated and never question the females authority and they said we take their name we have no choice as if I would want one. If your life mate ever dies or leaves the realms then you must go through spiritual cleansing by soaking yourself in a pool of water then slice off your tail with a ceremonial long-dagger then you may return to the dating seen, but if only a witness was present while you went into cleansing. As of now only two pairs of  life mates exist. They are:
Sonya Elderon and Jazbo Woondle
Wincesia Twygg and Aftertaste Twygg
 
Now I don't want to make anyone cut off their tail but these are answers to questions about their loves.
 
Sonya Elderon on her life-mate High Guard Noble Sir Jazbo Woondle - "I love him
dearly. I think I had the most fun just wandering around Spur watching Jaz perform dare-devil feats of Barbarism (Barbie-ism? ;) )."
 
Empress Wincesia on Royal Consort Aftertaste - "Then there was the day that
Aftertaste proposed. At first I was shocked that he'd broken the custom of female-dominance in our society, but I instantly forgave him and accepted the proposition."
 
Royal Consort Aftertaste Twygg - "Winnie.....jeez...there is nothing bad about
her...she's Odarous' greatest achievement."
 
High Guard Noble Sir Jazbo Woondle on Sonya Elderon - "She is great" short but
sweet (I guess but what do I know).
 
Weird Customs
        
The Monitanians have lots of strange customs. Maybe you have seen them used around Spur. Some of the customs that we have show the highest respect, but for other races it is disgraceful to do in public and taken as VERY offensive and you maybe killed for it. If they do try to kill you for it doing it, tell them that it is a custom we have and just walk away (run away if they are still trying to kill you). I have listed some of our customs below:
 
Spit at <target> - Shows respect for the lizard or other race of <target>

Pet <target> - Petting someone shows Dominance over the <target> if the <target> pets you back then it is usually taken as challenge (when petting be sure of the targets gender.  A male Monitanian should never pet a female one).
 
Bite <target> - This is used to show affection usually to a life mate or from a mother
to the adopted child.
 
Most of our other customs are the same as the customs of the other races but there are some different ones. 
 
Communication
      
Since we can not talk common we have found other ways to communicate with body language and hand signals. Intelligent animals can also be used to talk, this is the more costly of the ways to speak but the most affective. If you use your familiar than take care of it and don't use to fight or you will be stuck without a familiar. These communication signs are few known so I have put them here:
Advance: Point clenched fist (or weapon) toward sky.
Apologize: Place hand over heart and bow.
Bless: Cross hands and extend them before torso.
Buy: Hold coin in open palm.
Close: Close left fist.
Decapitate: Bring right hand across throat.
Defend: Bring left forearm across body.
Detect Trap: Run right hand across left arm.
Die: Close eyes and bring right hand down across face.
Directions: Inscribe a circle with the right hand. The circle represents a compass.
Disarm: Grasp left wrist with right hand.
Drag: Bring both fists left to right across torso.
Drink, Invite for a drink: Bring hand in cupping shape toward mouth.
ESP/Link: Touch head with right index finger.
Familiar: Place right fist on left shoulder. Refers to a person's animal companion.
Favors (From the gods): Lift left hand to the sky, and place right hand on the heart.
Fight: Slash air with right hand or weapon.
Fly: Flap arms once.
Give/Share: Arch right hand away from chest.
Heal: Make a wrapping motion around the torso.
Help, Seek: Extend both hands, palms up.
Hide: Cover eyes with hand.
Honor: Spit into hand and place hand over heart. Represents the virtue of Honor.
Insult: Bring right hand from left to right, palm down. Then, spit into hand and place  
hand over heart. This gesture is used rarely, and represents the worst of
insults.

Newbie killing, Townie killing, and Thieves

 Newbie killing and Townie killing is frowned upon by almost every Monitanian in
 Spur,but there are exceptions. When they tell us the weather or such a terrible thing we get insulted and have to kill them, but normally we do not kill them. Newbie killing is the exact opposite of  our beliefs and sometimes, and sometimes we are known to kill a few newbie killers and/or townie killers. It also seems that we have short tempers for those who steal from friends or us. These are some more excerpts from conversations:
 
Blackcrow Twygg (me)- "Personally I have, as of late, decided to stop doing the disarming part. (Townie Disarming is the same as townie killing because the major reason why anyone hates a townie killer is that it summons the guards to hurt the
innocents). I haven't done it for over 3 months, and have killed some townie killers."
 
Noble Baerqkra Dqualkaeir - "Newbie killing is wrong, unless there's a good reason for it, such as the newbie is extremely annoying, or something to that effect. Townie killing, by and large, is wrong... however, there are exceptions. Guards, guards attacking innocents, are an exception.  Those ignorant ones that see fit to insult Monitanians in my presence, for example."
 
High Guard Noble Sir Jazbo Woondle - "As a knight it is my job to protect newbies 
and townies."
 
Luminar Moonknight - "Well, if the townie insults my race ("The weather is only fit for
Monitanians!"), I may kill them, if it suits my mood. However, as an Odarian, I don't tend to do this often. Besides, the townies don't usually say that. As for newbie killing....well, if I catch you killing a newbie, you can be sure I'll kill you..."
 
Ryia Monit - "My view on newbie and townie-killers...  well, due to my religion and 
alignment, it's not really of my concern... however, when it comes to the safety of a newbie Monit, I will fight to defend him/her to the best of my ability - that is, if they haven't done something to sanction the attack. It's a hard, cruel world, and the Spur isn't known to coddle newbies, so we shouldn't raise our hackles when a newbie "does" get attacked.  I also believe townie killing is best left to personal beliefs. If you believe there's nothing wrong with killing town members, go for it. But otherwise, if you're against it, then don't. If one believes they should defend every townie, then they should do so. That's how it is now... and it's better left alone. There won't be a way to please everyone, so why try? I fully embrace my neutrality..."
 
Royal Consort Aftertaste Twygg - "Killing newbies is quite possibly the stupidest thing to do.  All it does is make life harder on yourself and others. Killing townies is another evil....but when your a kill-happy lizard, you cant help but indulge yourself once in a while.  Nobody's perfect."
 
Ogkay Clerio - "Well I believe that neither is right, that there is no dignity in hunting 
the innocents"
 
Fighters
      
The Monitanians that decided to be Fighters were probably the first hatched during the hatching season and the first of the new generation to reach Monitan. They also were the ones that were the last to leave Monitanian to go to Spur. Most Fighters are adopted children and the adopted Parents. They are usually the first to learn the ways of Spur and thus is why they are more organized and less disheveled. The Monitanians are the good at being fighters because we are so strong. This does not necessarily imply that this is how all fighters or Monitanians started,  and it is just a stereotype. There are now few Monitanian fighters in Spur, here is a list:
Royal Consort Aftertate Twygg 
Ryia Monit
Blackcrow Twygg (me)
Empress Wincesia Twygg
       
 
Barbarians
      
The Monitanians that decided to be Barbarians were probably the last to hatch and last to find Monitan. They were the first ones to ask Empress Wincesia to leave the Monitan and go to Spur. While in Spur they picked up the ability to berserk because of all the time they had spent in the wilderness and the little time they had spent in civilization. It is not like this for all Barbarians or Monitanians, just the majority. I have also complied a list of barbarians, but since it seems the newer Monitanians are getting born later in the year more and more.

Eben Wilsworth
Ogkay Clerio
Noble Baerqkra Dqualkaeir

Religion
     
Monitanians are divided among religion usually by race. Most Monitanians like to
follow Odarous if they have chosen to follow the life of a warrior even though I have
seen some a very few follow taath. If you are a barbarian they usually go for taath and Unknown not too many I know have ever gone to Odarous while being a barbarian. The religion of the Monitanians isn't as important as you would think. I have never seen or heard of a fight started because of religion well maybe one..............Religions of your beloved Monitanians:

Ryia Monit- Odarous' subject
Blackcrow Twygg (me) - Odarous' subject "I choose Odarous because He's the god of chivalry and that perfectly described the kind of fighter I wanted to be. I liked the fact to be a subject so I'd get to have honor in my battles as I always have wished. I always believed that a fighter is only as strong as his word in battle. Now you can believe me when I give you my word on Odarous so that you can trust me. So if I say I'm going to kill you I will. It may take me minutes, hours, days, weeks, months or even years if I have to."
 
Royal Consort Aftertaste Twygg - Odarous' subject
High Guard Noble Sir Jazbo Woondle - Unknown's subject
Noble Baerqkra Dqualkaeir - Odarous' subject 
Luminar Moonknight - Odarous' subject "Well, I chose Odarous for extra strength, and 'cause I'm an honorable lizard. I hit rogues with a steel saber twice. It's really fun. The first hit weakens them, and the second hit gets them near-death. They just sit there for a few seconds, and then die."
Empress Wincesia Twygg - Odarous' subject
Sonya Elderon - Odarous' subject
Ogkay Clerio - Odarous' subject
Eben Wilstorth - Taath's subject
 
S. O. R.
      
S. O. R. also known as Society Order of Reptiles. Its a group made exclusively for Monitanians. S. O. R. was originally made by Tryano through time it came to become a newbie killing group. (Those were some demented lizards or never raised into our customs.) After the last leader of the newbie killing S. O. R. died, my father, Royal Consort Aftertaste Twygg, took to the leadership, making it a newbie helping S. O. R. for the protection of  Newbies and Townies.  The way to show that you are currently a member of S. O. R. is to receive a Jade Ring from Aftertaste himself, but since the Tax collectors have come to town they have lost almost all of their members. Only two members remain, Aftertaste Twygg and Ryia Monit. Yes the power of S. O. R .has decreased but is still a powerful part of our history. To become a member of S. O. R. you must show your bravery in battle, your wisdom by settling things with words and not swords, and putting your heart into to helping newbies. Now this group sounds like more of a disadvantage than an advantage, but thats where you are wrong! Once you are in you have every other member fighting on your side for you. When they become as powerful as they once were you will be glad you got accepted into it.
 
A few comments from leader of S.O.R. Royal Consort Aftertase Twygg- "be a real
lizard, be a good citizen, and be a smart lizard, and you'll be happy."
 
A few comments on from Empress Wincesia Twygg- "I have never seen them do 
anything or accomplish anything but get matching jade rings"

A few comments from Blackcrow Twygg (me)- "I think that the new S. O. R. is great
now that its not a newbie killing group, I mean newbie killing is a disgrace. I used to be a member not sure if I am now (something concerning Michael, Ale, and 80k on a rainy day in the smuggler's tunnel). I think that S. O. R. was a great idea because it gives the few Monitanians that are left a great chance to survive in a world of killing. If you join S. O. R. you will earn more respect from the hairy ones."

Death
      
Killing in Spur is rare by a Monitanian in Spur they like to do their powerful killing
some place where it is not as populated so the one being killed isn't exposed to
scavengers who will steal stuff from the corpse. When we are killed if we get things
stolen from us you got a problem with all Monitanians since we are all friends and
friendships with a Monitanian last forever and ever so if you were mentioned as a
favorite mammal than you have that lizard to protect you for your or his / her whole life.
 We are also known to protect the ones that were innocent and killed if the innocent are stolen from while they are dead so we do usually drag the corpses into a place with magick surrounding it so they are not stolen from. We are famous for our ability to kill a weak mammal or rat, or rogue in one hit with even the weakest of weapons, such as a short tarnished silver dagger or a bark practice sword. Now you might say "Any race can do that" well not till they master the weapon they are using while a Monitanian can do the same thing at a novice level which is amazing to me.
 
 Date of Hatch
     
The date of hatch is very important to us Monitanians. It is the day that you hatched so that you know exactly where you are in the stand of all things. This isn't that important to Monitanians males as it is to Monitanian females because of their chance of being empress. I have included everyone's DOH or MOH (Month of Hatch)
 
 Blackcrow Twygg (me)- June
 Empress Wincesia Twygg - January
 Royal Consort Aftertaste Twygg - April
 High Guard Noble Sir Jazbo Woondle - January or late December
 Noble Baerqkra Dqualkaeir - January
 Luminar Moonknight - January
 Ogkay Clerio - April
 Scrill Silverscales - June
 Ryia Monit - May
 Sonya Elderon - April
 
 A Short history on Blackcrow (me): I hatched as soon as the tax collectors announced that in one month they would be collecting taxes it was in some cave. The one end was completely blocked off by a rock that had been shoved there by something strong and there was small hole in the back that took me to TG as if I was forced to go there. When in TG, I made my first kill which was a rat (boy was I proud). During my first hunt, I met the only Monitanian in TG at that time, Scrill. I was in attendance at the ceremony of Scrill and Mistee when they became life mates. Shortly after they were life mated (if you want to call it that), I ran to Spur because I thought they had gone to Spur (don't know why or at least can't remember). When I got there I got pick-pocketed and people tried to kill me, Then, I met Ryia. She took me under her tail, if you will. She showed me around Spur for that whole night and for that I have been ever so grateful. The fam shop was the
next stop she took me to. I only had enough money to buy a toad and she taught me how to put my money in the bank so I did not get picked. The only reason she said she was showing me around that night was because she was in "a be nice to newbies mood." Next thing I know, the taxes start and I only come in to work on my skills and realized that it was a lot more fun when TSC was filled to the top, day and night. I have acquired parents while working on my skills, Wincesia Twygg and Aftertaste Twygg. I never understood why so many mammals are taking over the Spur. That is pretty much where I am now.
 
 A Short history on High Guard Noble Sir Jazbo Woondle: You all know him and love
him yet I couldn't get much of a history for him. He was born somewhere near Monitan and stayed in TG for 5 months (long time). When he got to Spur he had so much impressed the Empress she made him High-Guard. After he became high guard he was made a noble of the realm for his strength and ability to kill almost everything and everyone in Spur (Well once he berserks). Now that ability has earned him the respect of most of all the inhabitants of the Spur. Also it has gained him the title of The Lizard with the largest ego. Lately he has become a knight of the realms for the respect he has gained from the elders and the others. His job is to protect the innocent of the realms, which he did before hand any ways so its no a problem for him. 
 
 A Short history on Noble Baerqkra Dqualkaeir: He had as he said a much uneventful life describing it as bland. Killing on occasion and just socializing is what he likes and remembers best of Spur. Hunting is one of his past times (pretty typical of all
Monitanians)
 
 A Short history on Ryia Monit:  She was born in Monitan, a small swampy island off of Monitan.  She was the only offspring of her parents - both of which past away to the big swamp in the sky shortly after her hatching (a freak accident dealing with feathers and a soggy sandwich - or so she is told).  She grew up in nearby village, earning her keep as a bar wench for the local fisher-lizards. Dreaming of traveling to far-distant lands and meeting new races, She occasionally visited the small Fighter's Guild located deep in the muck-swamps to hone her fighting and weapons skills - for she knew she must learn to defend herself in foreign lands.  When she felt she was ready to finally leave her homeswamp and journey to strange new places, she packed up her  mammal skins, hot rock (which got lost on the trip), put on her light suede boots, and set out into the world.  She neither knew where she was heading or what destination she had in mind, but from friendly Hith she met and befriended along the way, she learned of a place called the Spur. Being young and a newbie , she decided to spend some time in the Academy located in the Training Grounds further developing her skills.  There, in the TG, she met others like herself, but were more knowledgeable, and from them she learned the art of
 Monitanian survival.  They called themselves the SOR, or Society of Reptiles (sometimescalling themselves simply as the Clan) and they took her in and made me feel welcome. They were her first true friends and loyalty.  Then, weeks later, she made her trek into the Spur.  She has made and lost friends, both mammalian and reptilian... felt and experienced love, then only to lose it, won battles, lost some, knew sweet revenge and the harsh bitterness of life...  but throughout it all, she knew she had the support of her Monitanian brothers and sisters.  
 
 A Short history on Luminar Moonknight: He was born in Monitania a very small colony on a island near the island of Leuia. When he was born the only ones in the colony where Medussa and Luminar so he figured they had to be his parents. Later on they died in battle mysteriously. He decided to call himself Luminar after his father. One day while trying to hunt for himself a few young leuians told him of an far away land called Monitan, so he built a raft and tried to sail to Monitan. When he had started out the sea was very calm, but quickly it turned to a terrible sight and tipsy turvey the raft into pieces. He managed to cling on to a board from his raft when a Frontican ship came by and he climbed aboard, a few Fronticans hated the idea of a Monitanian on their ship and resisted he managed to hide from these few in an abandoned cabin, but when someone found out they had drained him vigorless so it was easy to put him in a prison cell. After months of that prison cell he was full grown and bashed down the door, he went berserk and killed all the Fronticans on the ship except for the ones that had translocated out. He than jumped over board til exhausted. Call it luck but he made it to shore, waking up surrounded by Seagulls. This beach is called "Tanga" he would later find out. There was a sign there that said that TG and Spur were close. So he shut his eyes and walked down a path until he hit something big and cold. It was the cold gate to TG he went in with a sigh of relief. He meet this guy named SSchro that gave him the opportunity to join the mercenaries guild. They taught him every skill he need including sharps. They sent him on a lot of trips which got him some pay. Next he wandered into the TG library and took out a book called "Honor and Battle". It was about battle tactics and featured Odarous on the cover. After reading the book he went to Singing Steel and Armor Shop. He looked in the inventory, there was tons of stuff, after thinking for awhile he decided to buy a bastard-sword. He left hoping to come back sometime when he had more money taking a wrong turn he ran into the bank, there they taught him to deposit his money so that no thief would steal it. He left the bank and wandered northwest when he started to hear swords against leather and screams of pain. He wandered north out of curiosity and went through an open black obsidian gate, he found mostly rodents then stumbled upon a shade. The shade kept hitting him so he bit down on his tongue after that everything was a blur. He regained his senses and saw a dead shade on the ground, he let out a battle cry of triumph. Noticing he was almost dead from an injury he wondered back the way he
came and found a bunch of healers so he got healed. Again he went back and did the same thing this time he got healed by a cleric named Aeris. He liked her and started to kiss her and flirt with her soon they became engaged to be life mates, traveled to Spur was the next thing he did. There he met some Spurians struck up a conversation with a dragon named Shanz and they quickly became friends.

The New Being
By Sennid Notasecian

One day, I went for a walk down to the southern lands.  I was bored from killing rogues and skeletons and trolls, So I decided to go and find a new and more challenging foe to fight.  I needed the money because A peddler was coming in a few days and I wanted to give my armor a shining.  Anyway, I made my may toward the southlands.  Of course along the way there was a few rogues and rats that looked as though they needed my special touch.  So I fought a few rogues and rats for a little practice for whatever was to come.  As I got to the large gate separating the town from the wilderness, I felt a strange feeling, it was so quiet, so.... eerie.  I shrugged it off thinking it was my nerves from the excitement of finding new things to kill.  So I wandered through the gate through the plains looking for something to play with.  Well, after awhile, Everything looked the same.  Just plains as far as the eyes can see.  I kept walking and walking and walking.  No matter which direction I went in, north, south, east, west,  It was all the same.  I was getting tired so I decided to sit down and rest for awhile.  When I awoke I found myself face to face with what looked like a mutated human.  Well, I guess spending as much time in the middle of the sun with nothing would make you look like that.  Anyways,  I jumped up got in my fighting stance.  The thing started biting at me.  It was hurting me a little bit but I was not really concerned.  I backicked the thing.  It was a good blow to the head.  Then it bit at me.  Then I kicked at it.  We did this for about 10 minutes, each of us getting weaker and weaker from each blow we were taking and delivering.  Finally, with all the ounce of strength I had I delivered a headbutt to the thing.  It was an excellent strike to the head.  It stumbled over, fell down, and died.  With a sigh of relief I sat down and prayed to Taath for healing and revigorating.  After awhile, he answered my prayers and I lay down and fell asleep from one of the most tiresome battles I had ever had.  I awoke with a startle,  It was nighttime,  I looked around and I thought to myself  "my what an awful dream,"  But then I lit a torch and looked around, and saw the things body.  I got up, stretched, then walked over to the corpse.  The smell was pretty bad now, So I searched through it, and removed its pouch.  It had some gold and silver in it.  Not bad, more than a rogue ever carries.  I gathered my things and headed off again, hoping not to have to confront one of those things again.  After what seemed like days of walking I finally came to a river.  I filled my belly with the nice refreshing water, and washed myself off.  I decided to rest there for a little while.   Which turned out to be a bad idea.  I looked around and I saw a little frog.  I looked around, then looked at the frog again.  Then I heard a rumbling.  I looked around thinking earthquake.  But it turned out to be my stomach.  Man, I was starving.  I walked over to the frog licking my fangs.  The frog looked up at me with an innocent "RIBBIT".  As soon as I was about to grab it, with a flick of its tongue a stream of acid shot right into my eyes.  I screamed in pain. Never had I ever felt such pain.  Attempting to cover all of my eyes  I rummaged for some of my stuff and ran, running wildly, not caring where I was going, just as long as there as no frogs.  After a few hours the pain went away from most of my eyes and I could see again.  I looked around and I was in a very strange place.  I looked at my map.  I had actually gone off the map.  I was no longer in the spur limits.  I muttered to myself and looked around trying to figure out what to do.  I walked over by a large rock and sat down to think.  As I sat there thinking of what to do, I heard a rumbling again.  I looked down at my stomach and thought "Oh great, I'm lost and hungry too."  But then the rumbling got louder and louder.  I said out loud, "This ain't my stomach rumbling!"  Then I felt a shaking behind me,  I turned and looked.  The rock was standing up!!  It was a huge rock beast! 

Never had I see nor heard of anything like this before.  It stood up and stared at me.  He grabbed me by one of my legs and said in a foreign language, "HSKF IUD SIGSKF HS FJR FJHDNDFJD FD FJDHDJ!!!!!!!!!!"  I did not have to understand what he had just said.  The extremely large frown and mad look on his face was a good reason to think he was not too happy.  I wiggled free from his grasp, and fell to the ground.  I looked up as this large foot was coming down toward my little head.  I scurried and rolled around.  Every time his foot would come crashing to the ground it was always just inches from me.  I stood up, and took off running, leaving all of my traveling supplies next to now hole where I had sat down at.  I took of running never bothering to look back.  I knew he was following me though.  I could hear the BOOM!  BOOM!  BOOM!  BOOM!  BOOM!  every few seconds from him chasing me.  But after awhile I didn't hear it anymore.  But not after I had gotten into the southern lands.  I prayed and prayed that it would just turn around and not keep coming in this direction.  I was now in the boundaries of spur, and if it was to someone wander into the city, I think our people would have problems.  I shook those thoughts out of my heads, and just continued to walk straight north.  Eventually, after about a day of walking north I came upon the fairgrounds.  I was glad to see familiar land again.  I got excited and I ran all the way to Town Square to try and tell people about what had happened to me.  I ran into TS  shouting and making gestures trying to show that I had encountered a big rock creature, but no one could understand me.  I looked around for one of my kind but none were around.  I sighed and sat down muttering to myself.  People were laughing at me, and pointing at me.  Then a Hithual walked up to me with a cup of ale.  He said "Here my friend,  You should take some of this to relax."  I accepted with a grim smile and nod, and downed the glass and put it down at my side.  Then I crawled off into a far corner of town, and drew a picture of the outline of spur, then drew a picture of a giant creature, with an arrow pointing on the outside of spur, thinking people would know then.  I turned over, and passed out.  
Now if you see any rock monsters running around TS stepping on you, don't say I didn't try to warn you.

The Gobbie "In The Beginning" Story
By an Unknown Reporter

While napping in the shadows (yes, napping; it was the best thing I could come up with... I couldn't just outright say I was spying now could I?) I happened to overhear a whispered conversation between several gobbies.  They seems kind of frantic about something and in their haste they were speaking Common so I could understand every word (how convenient eh?). I caught the words "secret meeting", "only Gobbies", "in the meeting place".  Being of an inquisitive mind, I was, well... inquisitive. Staying in the shadows, I followed the Go-blins through the dark street of Spur and out of town.  After several minutes of walking and having almost lost them many times, we finally came to a stop in front of a partially hidden hole that was the entrance to a cave. They entered and I slipped in with them, unnoticed by the guard at the entrance.  I quickly found a nice niche to hide in and sat down to wait and see what would happen next.  As I hid in my corner, the sputtering fire in the center of the dank cave twisted the shadows of the small squat Go-blins and Go-blin-als into misshapen giants on the damp glistening walls of the cave. There were not that many Go-blins crowded in the small cave, but what few there were, represented the major clans of the Go-blin(al) Tribe. Their guttural speech echoed loudly as they talked excitedly about the night's upcoming events. 

From what I could understand, they all had been summoned to the Meeting Cave by Boodla, the Queen-Mama Gobbie, for a telling of the Ancient Gobbie "In-the-beginning" Story. There was a commotion at the dark hole that was the entrance into the cave and Boodla sauntered in.  She smiled that feral smile of hers and quickly moved to the center of the Meeting Cave to stand beside the fire.  She glanced around the room and impatiently tapped her foot while she waited for the eager clans to stop yammering. "Now, ya all know why wez here tonight", she began.  "Tonight is da night dat you all git to hear the story of how all da Gobbies and Gobbie-als came ta be here." "Now ifn you'd all jus' SHUT UP, we could git ta da tellin' of da Story.	Boodla scowled the yammering Go-blin(al)s into silence and began to chant in a mixture of Go-blin and Go-blin-al. "In the beginning the Gods created the races. We, the Go-blins and Go-blin-als were not created then. We are the children of Set, and although many of us do not follow Him in these times, we were all originally the Children of Set.  This is how it came about:  Set, god of the thieves, brooded in his dimly lit, lavishly decorated chambers.  He was restless, but what could he possibly be lacking?  His followers were many and the more successful of them were hungry for his favor and generous in their  donations.  He wanted for nothing, yet he felt there was something missing.  He contemplated his clerics' successful recruiting amongst all of the races; even many of the "honorable", mostly Odarian Khats had been swayed by the promises of money and luxuries.  Sans, Khats, Spiders, Pents, Humans, a few Lizards and even a Fir or two could be found in his temple worshipping him and practicing the occupation of thief.  Easy money appeals to anyone no matter what their race.  Wait; there, maybe, was the source of his restlessness.  Even though he had many followers of many races, none of those races were truly devoted to him and him alone.  Even the Sans and Spiders, wicked by nature, were mostly devoted to Taath; and you can't forget about all those Taathian Thugs and Oogs out there either.  That odious Odarous, with all of his damnable honor, had his Khats, Hiths and anything else that had an overbearing sense of right and wrong. Rhianni and Elindale had their peaceable Firs, Usils, and a good portion of the glowers and those goodie-goodie Secians too.  And Sa, well Sa just about tried to lay claim to anything that had magic, the Secians, the glowers, and the gem heads.  Set had no race that he could call his own, and it bothered him.  Ordinarily, when a god desires something it just happens; mountains move, plagues fall on unsuspecting masses, demons invade, and the sky rains oliphants.  But Set, being one of the more self-absorbed gods, never really had contemplated actual creation before; usually preferring to "borrow" things from other gods.  And when it came down to it, Set found that, try as he might, he was not capable of just simply Creating a race.  So, he did what any true thief would do, he made a plan to steal one.  In the dark of the night, Set took on physical form and crept into a human village like any common prowler.  Cloaked in shadows that only another god could penetrate he stalked among the darkened houses of the village listening for a certain sound.  He paused at the window of one house and with a small, satisfied smirk, took on the substance of the very shadows that he hid in and passed through the walls into the tiny house.  He glided up the stairs and into a small bedroom where there was a woman laying asleep on her bed with a small infant held in her arms.  The female child was small,
frail and looked as if she had been sick since birth.  The sound Set had heard was her faint coughing and whimpers.  He could see that in normal circumstances this infant would not last the week.  Normal circumstances, that is; but what Set had planned for this sickly babe, was hardly normal.  Enveloping the baby in shadows, he gently took the child from her mother's arms and instantly she ceased her whimpering and with a whispered word from Set, she fell fast asleep. With another murmured word from Set, both he and the baby vanished, and the mother slept on with her arms curled around nothing but a faint shadow.  Within next few month Set stole, or rescued, many more babies from many different families; Leuians, Hithuals, Secians, almost every race that was to be found in Spur.  All these children he took to deep cavern hidden in his domain and they were tended to and raised by trolls. Over time the darkness of the cavern, the influence of the trolls, and the powerful warping magic of Set began to change the children. 

Although many became healthy once again, they never became very strong and their size was horribly stunted.  Any fur that the child might once have had, soon was gone; wings shriveled and fell off.  The color of their skin soon started to become more like their surroundings, dark and moist.  Their eyes became adjusted to the dark of the cave and they were able to see in the dark.  Set taught them his ways; the ways of thievery, stealth and greed and soon they began to fight, and steal and cheat each other; much to Set's pleasure.  The creatures formed two factions: one a group of the bigger, slightly smarter creatures; the second the rest of the smaller, quicker creatures. Over the months these creatures lived and bred (their mating habits could be likened to that of rabbits)in the cavern, watched and taught by Set.  The two groups developed their own crude languages, similar but separate.  Set even named his "pets" after words in their own early languages. Go-blin meaning "dark-thing"; and Go-blin-al meaning "dark-thing-small".  The Go-blin(al)s soon became too  great in number to live in the cave and they were eager to see the sewers of Spur that Set had told them of. And so, Set let the go-blin(al)s loose on Spur.  They invaded Spur through its sewers, frightening small children and their mothers, swiping nobles' coin purses and generally causing much annoyance to the city of Spur.  

A tradition that we will forever uphold. The End.  As  Boodla ended the story, the other Gobbies sat in silence; pondering all they had been told.  I quietly stood up, and staying close to the wall and far in the shadows, crept towards the way out of the cave. I knew that this would be a story that would feed me for weeks to come.  Still unseen, I exited the cave and once in the cool dark of the night I breathed a small sigh of relief.  Who knows what the go-blins would have done to me if I would have been caught. I started to walk back towards town when out of nowhere a hand rested on my shoulder and I felt the thin prick of a very sharp blade against my back, ready to be slid between my ribs and into my heart.  A sultry, feminine voice hissed in my ear, "You seem to think our secrets and privacy can be had without a price young one.  My Tribe has killed for less..."  The hand on my shoulder slowly turned me around to face the voice.  A surprisingly tall female Go-blin stood there smiling wickedly at me.  "How much is that story and your life worth?", she purred softly.  Since she had transferred the point of her blade from my back to my chest, right over my heart, I just stood there and stupidly stammered at her.  "Ah, such a shame, with such stealth I had hoped there came intelligence."  She laughed silently and gave me an odd smile.  "Since I do not follow the old ways... and the fable that Boodla so loves I find silly and a child's tale; I shall tell you how much they are worth, and don't assume that because of the way it is stated that it is a small price. Sometime, perhaps soon, perhaps many moons from now, I shall require your payment.  But don't be mistaken, your payment will be made.  Go ahead and let Spur see the silly tale... it means nothing to me."  With those words she let go of my shoulder and I slide bonelessly to the ground.  She walked slowly away, her back to me as if she feared no danger from me, the shadows seemed to cling to her.  She turned around once, right before she disappeared.  She smiled that creepy smile and reached up to rub something silver that sparkled in her black hair, a tiara of some sort.  I could have sworn I heard her softly say, "One day... the Go-blin Tribe shall arise... then they will fear....fear us and our new Lord."

Some Apples Go VERY Bad
By Sygnis Skysoar (Editor's note-this rather conflicts with the point of view, but don't ask me.)

There were 4 in the group, Me, the dragon, Sygnis Redkite, Taia Shirk, and Nertal Cora, a Thugian with a huge hammer.  We were wandering carefully through the woods, I was carrying a sword, Sygnis a long-spear, Taia, nothing, and Nertal, a hammer.  Taia was our rezzer.  Everything had been pretty slow, we hadn't found much.  Suddenly, a dagger came flying out of the woods, right at me!  I smacked it off.  Sygnis moved toward the wood.  He jabbed in the butt of his spear, and brought out a Go-blin-al.  We tossed him away like garbage.  We moved on.  

We encountered several trolls, and got them all.  Sygnis was particularly active.  He was a lot more "attacky" than usual.  I wondered why.  Later, at night, while we were asleep, Sygnis screamed.  We rushed to his side.  He was there, on the floor, with one had over his eyes and one scanning the ground for his glasses.  He found them, and said he was all right.  We all went to sleep.  Sygnis decided to go off for a walk.  In the morning, Sygnis was back, and we resumed traveling.

Today, another thief tried to kill me(Magic skin, dragon essence, that thing.).  But before he threw, Sygnis had torn him to pieces!  The thief was decapitated, disemboweled, and everything!  That wasn't Sygnis.  I questioned, but all he said was "Corrlus? Are you all right?" and pulled his glasses down a little to look at me.  Impossible.  Without glasses, Sygnis couldn't see to the end of his nose.  But we moved on.  Sygnis was very fighty.  He was killing everything.  Not common.  But, anyway, we moved.
 
At night,  Nertal and Sygnis had gone walking together.  I followed secretly.  I didn't have a grain of trust for Sygnis, I never did.  And after that night, I will never trust a bird again.  He led Nertal to an alter, but told him it was a bed.  Nertal slept on it.  Sygnis removed a sacrificial dagger.  He killed Nertal.  He ate Nertal's heart.  It was horrible.  I left.  I tried to tell Taia, but I couldn't.  It was too gruesome.  I just got some sleep.

Tommorow, more hunting.  Another attempt on my life.  Sygnis shoved the thief's dagger down his throat, and left him be.  Amazing.  We moved on.  I stopped fighting altogether.  I didn't need to.  I saw Sygnis kill everything tha crawled our way.  He even killed Taia's familiar.  When I asked about Nertal, he said Nertal went back to the city.  I didn't believe him.  We hunted, and hunted, and hunted until the sun went down.  Then we went to sleep.  I couldn't sleep.  I thought about what happened.  I realived that this was Taath at work.  His servants, war, death, betrayel, hate, and lies, were here.  And they were like Tapeworms.  Eating away at Sygnis.  Well I got up and readied my weapon.  These tapeworms were going to get exterminated.  Then I heard Taia's scream...

I scrambled to Taia's tent, and saw Sygnis, trying to do something with her.  I took a guess and decided it was enough to be punished.  I said "Sygnis!  Get those things out of you body!"  Then Sygnis did a horrible thing.  He shoved me back.  Then he kissed Taia.  With every one of those evils entering her.  I dashed forward, trying to stop him.  He shoved me off.  Then Sygnis was done.  Taias had those things in her body, and she left.  Sygnis was back together, but not Taia.  She flew off.  We steeled ourselves weapons and moved into battle...

What had happened to Taia was horrible.  She looked like a cross between a xenomorph, a Monitian, and a Dragon.  She was big, slimy, and evil.  We had followed her to the end-point.  Her cave.  We entered, and moved in slowly.  This was more that a cave, it was a volcano.  We saw her.  I resolved to go end her with my fire, but Sygnis decided to go for it's black heart.  He started signing.  He sung "Yesterday"-her least favorite song.  Bad move.  She grabbed him, bit his upper body off, and tossed his legs into Magma, eating the torso.  I moved to attack.  I started attacking, and calling "Rinnani!  Destroy this beast, and save us all!"  No answer.  We battled on.  I was bleeding, battered and bloodstained, but she was barely hurt.  I just gave up.  But then, something miraculous happened...

I stood up.  My weapon changed to a beam of light.  I became powerful...I moved in.  With every hack, I sang my song, proud and true…"Starlight Express, Starlight Express!", and soon I had her too tired to move.  I stood on it's chest, and uttered these words...."Taia, you have to come out of that thing....It'll kill us all..." But it didn't leave.  It died.  How do I know?  Becuase Taath told me himself.....

Taath came.  He was wearing his black robes, his hood, his long sickle.  I saw him. All he said was "You stopped my plan cold.  You were good and pure of heart.  But now you're at an end!"  He launched an evil orb at me.  It hit.  I felt electric pain all over my body.  My sword dropped.  My armor capsized.  All I was was a spectre.  "You like being a ghost?  Good, because that's what you are.  Take advantage of your power.  Abuse it.  You're the servant of fear.  Strike fear into the hearts of the mortals, and you will prosper.  Befriend them, and you will lose your power, lose your life, and your afterlife becomes a living hell.  Got that?  Good, now just sign here, and you'll be on your way."  I signed. I had nothing else to do, nowhere to go.  But hey, this could go somewhere.  I could become the betrayer of the dragon, go get skins, all that stuff.  Hey, this could be fun....
