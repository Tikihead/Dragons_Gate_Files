Dear Readers,

Thanks for picking up a copy of the Dragon Fire Chronicle, issue # 10!  This issue is somewhat late in its release, due to a rather unfortunate incident near the offices involving an open window and a very hungry landshark.  Be that as it may, I am sure you're all eager to get reading, so I'll keep this short.  We have, as usual, a fine selection of submissions served up this month (yes, served up, they taste great with a side of Hithual ale- just ask the landshark) including a bit of lore for all you history buffs out there.  Not to mention another jaw-droppingly stunning masterpiece from the pen of a certain unimaginably talented, gifted-by-the-gods, ravishingly charismatic, and incredibly MODEST bard who apparently frequents our fine realm.

If anyone finds that person, let me know.

In any case, it is my hope that you all will enjoy this issue.  Keep your harp strings dry, and your office windows in a firmly shut position!

The Life of Darigus Crownguard (pt. 1)
By Darigus Crownguard


Darigus Crownguard awoke with a start, promptly bumping his head against the sagging bunk mattress above him. Grumbling, he roughly prodded the bottom of the offending mattress, eliciting a sleepy grunt from his friend, Agnot the Oog-ra.  Snorting in disgust, Darigus slid out of bed and gathered his clothes together to get dressed, sitting hunched over on the side of the bed. Jumping up in surprise and thudding the back of his neck against the bottom of a wooden bunk support, Darigus could almost feel the hairs on his head being sucked upwards as Agnot breathed a great rattling snore that made Darigus's throat hurt just to think about. Suddenly in a foul mood and rubbing his sore neck, the human knight grumbled to himself and sat back down to dress, flinching whenever Agnot snored.

 Unlike most knights, he was a bit of a wanderer, and as of such did not have to comply to the strict rules of dress laid on those knights that stayed in a lords castle or such. He donned a pair of loose tan breeches that bagged at the bottom, then pulled an equally loose tunic over his chest, clothing well suited for the hot weather that came with the summer. He then pulled on a pair of sturdy boots, lined inside with soft wool. He strapped on his belt, and tied on his scabbard and coinpurse, which was waiting for him on the dresser nearby. Darigus glanced into the mirror with blue-green eyes and ran a hand across his head, covered in very short brown hair, cut to fit easily in a helmet. He rubbed the hilt of his sword, tightly strapped into the scabbard, before turning to wake Oog, his companion.

Darigus was a young knight, having just reached 18 summers of age. It was on his 16th birthday that his trainer and mentor had given him a suit of sturdy plate armor and a fine steel sword and released him from training. Darigus pondered again the circumstances that had caused him to leave home and become a traveling knight. The petty lord Garagos that he would have served was having financial problems from tradewars with the neighboring kingdom of Potesh, and couldn't afford to keep Darigus around. These financial problems had come from an influx of bandits from across the Great Divide. Many in Chessenta thought that Potesh had some of these bandits in their employ, resulting in trade tensions in both countries. So it was that Darigus found himself, two years after his unexpected departure, in a cheap room on the second floor of the Green Tree Inn, dressing himself in anticipation of meeting with a person he had met in the Inn the night before, a person he had taken quite a liking to.

As he roughly shook Agnot awake, he found himself recalling the Fir Elf that had sat down at the table he and Agnot were sharing the night before. Her name was Fiera, aptly named for the dark orange, curly hair that hung about her hair. He had found her quite attractive, with bright green eyes and a splendid form and grace to her. She talked to him softly, explaining that a small band of trolls had taken up residence in the Fir's forest to the east of town, and that her people were too busy protecting their borders from the bandits to spare any warriors to deal with them. She had approached the leader of her band and asked permission to find people willing to help her clean out the cave. Her bands leader, named Sithalas, had assented to pay handsomely in gold for warriors, and assigned her to find warriors, as she was as yet still young and would not be too sorely missed on the borders. Darigus had jumped at the chance to help the charming young woman, not to mention that he was in dire need of money, as well as something to break up the monotony of traveling.

Darigus chuckled softly as Agnot got up, grumpier than usual at the rude awakening. Agnot clambered out of bed and dressed up in his typical clothing, a pair of short breeches, made of soft leather, and a thick vest of leather, reinforced with tightly woven fur for protection. Agnot was rather tall as Oog-ra go, standing just under eight feet tall, and bulging with the rock-hard muscles that seemed standard for all Oog-ra, not to mention the shock of unruly black hair that hung about his head. Having lived amongst the more civilized peoples of Spur for a good while, Agnot had at least become somewhat more mannered than most, if not particularly bright. "It's time to get going Agnot," said Darigus.

"Why you wake me?" snorted Agnot, still half-asleep.

'It's dawn."

"So?"

"We have to meet Fiera in the village square today remember?"

"Elf lady with bloody hair?"

"Yes, that's the one," Darigus chuckled, "and we should get up now if we want some time to get ready."

"Let's go then" said Agnot shortly before turning and walking out the door, picking up and easily shouldering a heavy maul that Darigus knew from experience was far too heavy for him to carry, not to mention deadly to those he and Agnot had engaged before, for the most part bandits that were always a problem in the area.

Smiling to himself as he heard Agnot clomping down the stairs, Darigus could barely remember the circumstances that made him and Agnot friends. He remembered when he was very young a patrol returning from the borderlands with an Oog-ra child. Looking back on the incident, Darigus just assumed that Agnot had been orphaned somehow, and the patrol had come across the child or some such. He was never really told. As it was, Agnot stayed in the village, living in the streets. Darigus often wandered about the village when he was not training, and slowly endeared himself to Agnot, who was likable, if rather disgusting. Over the course of years, Darigus slowly cultivated the tiny seed of culture in Agnot. That seed hadn't exactly sprouted a blossoming cherry tree, but at least there was grass to cover the dirt. Agnot had stated that he would travel with Darigus when he heard that Darigus was leaving. No one in the city missed him, but Darigus was happy to have a friend come along.

Darigus grinned, then slowly shut the door behind him so as not to disturb the other people in the Inn before quickly and quietly walking down the steps to catch up with Agnot and meet up with Fiera in the village square at noon. At least this day looks to be interesting, he thought to himself cheerily.

* * *

Darigus met up with Agnot in the downstairs lobby/tavern. Seeing as how they had a good five or so hours before they were scheduled to meet Fiera, they settled on getting some breakfast before spending the cool hours of the morning wandering the town. They were the first customers to show up, and the Inn seemed empty at such an hour, but shortly after sitting down, a barmaid came out of the kitchen, noticed them, and came over to serve them. "What can I do to help you two gentlemen?" asked the barmaid, in a tired voice. She was in her late twenties Darigus would guess, with short blond hair and brown eyes.

"I would appreciate some buttered biscuits and two eggs myself, I don't know about my friend here," said Darigus.

"I eat bacon breakfast," stated Agnot simply.

"You had best make that a triple serving to save yourself some time . . . oh and a glass of milk each," added Darigus.

"I'll bring it out to you when its done; it may be a little while since its rather early." explained the barmaid, glancing meaningfully at Darigus. Darigus took the bait.

"We are meeting an acquaintance in the village square at noon," explained Darigus, "and are leaving shortly after that for a goodly amount of time. 

"I see. Well good luck and godspeed to you and your friend," said the barmaid, slightly impressed at Darigus, who to her eyes was some wandering armed stranger.

"Thank you good maid," smiled Darigus, before returning to what he was doing, which at the moment consisted of looking out the window and watching the pink sky and wispy gray clouds shift across the sky.

The maid left, and about 30 minutes later, that same maid returned with a plate of three flaky, lightly buttered biscuits and two eggs for Darigus, while she slid a platter heaped with greasy bacon in front of Agnot, as well as two large cups of cold milk. While Agnot greedily devoured his bacon, Darigus handed ten silver coins to the maid, who curtsied and left to help the cooks with making the morning meal. Darigus considered the diminishing band of pink sky before turning to Agnot, who was still enthusiastically chomping away at his bacon. "I have never fought trolls before, have you Agnot?"

'Uhh-Uhh," said Agnot briefly.

"I was taught that they can regenerate wounds they sustain, and that they are almost impossible to kill permanently . . . ." said Darigus softly.

Agnot continued to eat, occasionally taking a long drink of milk.

"I wonder how Fiera plans to 'eliminate' these trolls.." pondered Darigus.

"You going eat that?" asked Agnot, nodding at Dariguss meal.

"I had planned to," said Darigus, smiling. He finally started to eat, and managed to finish just slightly after Agnot. It had been quite a good meal, but now it was time to get ready before heading to village square. The pair stood, Darigus leaving a few silver for the maid before they stepped outside. Agnot waited downstairs while Darigus returned to their room and put on his armor. It was a light suit of platemail, with a platemail breastplate, elbow pieces, shoulder guards, and knee guards, as well as a pair of sturdy steel gauntlets, the rest of his body covered by black chainmail. The armor as a whole was well polished, something Darigus insisted on. Darigus also picked up a large steel shield, the bare steel painted over in white, with an eagle clutching a sword in its talons, one of the many signs of Odarous, and strapped it to his arm.  Darigus was soon armored and back downstairs. "What we do till high sun?" inquired Agnot.

"I suppose you will have to find something to do on your own for a while; I myself am going to visit the shrine of Odarous they have just outside of town."

Agnot just shrugged. "Ok, me find sumtin do till high sun."

It took a good thirty minutes before he arrived at a small shrine dedicated to Odarous. The village could not afford one church, let alone one church for each of the numerous gods, so individuals had taken it upon themselves to make this simple shrine outside of town for Odarians to worship at. When Darigus had been here last, it had been three days ago. As he kneeled before the simple wooden altar, he slowly recited the hymns to Odarous he had been taught, giving praise to Odarous for all that he had, and praying for good luck against the trolls he planned to face. As he prayed, he could feel the worry, the strain, and pressure of past events fall off him like water. Thoroughly refreshed, he placed a large handful of coins on the altar, leaving perhaps fourty in his purse. He recited the ritual, and the silver coins shone brightly in the rising suns light, then were gone. Darigus smiled slightly as he turned to make the long journey back to town square; the sun was almost at noon.

As he strode into the dirt clearing in town that was the square, he spotted Agnot and Fiera, engaged in conversation  "Hail!" cried Darigus, striding up to the pair. Agnot turned and waved as Darigus approached
"Ah, you have returned I see. Your big friend here was just telling me that you had left and would be back shortly; I guess he was right" smiled Fiera.

Darigus smiled. "Well, you said we had to meet at high noon?" asked Darigus.

"Yes we should get moving shortly" stated Fiera.

"One thing before we set out; what is our reward for this?" Darigus asked ashamedly. "We are a little short on money, in case you are wondering."

"Sithalas said that he would give you one hundred gold coins if you would eliminate the trolls."

Darigus's jaw hit the floor. With all that, he and Agnot would be set for months!

"Plus, you keep whatever treasure the trolls may have scrounged up."

Darigus blinked several times.

"Is that all right?"

"Yes yes, that's just fine!" said Darigus, flustered.

Fiera smiled sweetly at Darigus. "I asked Sithalas how we could hope to permanently kill a troll, and he said the best way to go about it is to pierce its heart with a good blade," said Fiera as she ran her thumb across the scabbard she wore at her waist. She wore a short black leather skirt, slit up the side for ease of movement, and wore tight emerald green scale mail.

Fiera's statement answered the question he was about to ask. "Well then, I suppose we are ready?" asked Darigus.

"Agnot ready go."

"Well then, shall we be off?" asked Fiera, smiling sweetly, "I will lead you to the troll's cave; it is a few days walk west through some rough territory, so lets go."

Agnot and Darigus followed behind the beautiful young Fir Elf as she quickly headed out of town and blazed a trail through the deep woods, leading them closer to the lair of the trolls, deep in the elven forest . . . 

***

The trio found themselves, after two uneventful days of travel through the forest, at the base of a small rocky hill. A cave was apparent on the side of the hill, about ten foot high and fifteen or so across. They had arrived in the late morning, the sun rising behind the hill, casting a shadow over the hillside. "Well, we had best start now," stated Darigus, a bit hesitant to enter such a foreboding place.

"All right, I will carry a torch so you two can use your weapons and armor to the fullest," said Fiera, untying the sword in her scabbard. Darigus did the same and added, "There isn't enough room for us to walk three abreast; I will go first, then you, then Agnot."

"Sounds good to me" agreed Fiera, her eyes bright with excitement. Agnot merely brought the heavy maul to a forward position.

The trio stopped at the entrance as Fiera lit a torch Darigus had been carrying, a simple long stick, with one end wrapped heavily in a cloth strip soaked with dried lamp oil. In the meantime, Darigus peered into the cavern; it had the molded look of a cavern shaped by water, he noted, not land shifts. He glanced around and a sight confirmed this. The three of them stood in front of the cavern, which sloped downward, The rocky hillside soaked up little water. Some was dripping down from above, forming a small rivulet in the bottom of the cavern. During times of rainfall, the cavern would be flooded; he assumed the water drained through some natural crack in the cave back to another place somehow. Before he could ponder this anymore, Fiera had lit the torch. "Well then, I guess we had better get started" said Fiera, eyeing the cave warily.

"It should just be a straight tunnel; it was shaped by water," added Darigus.

"Time go earn pay," said Agnot impatiently.

"Yes, let's go" said Darigus, as the they assumed a walking order and the three disappeared from sight, the flickering light from Fiera's torch slowly fading into the cave.


 . . . To be continued.

The Collaborators
By Nadjia Darkmist


On the Sanene Isle, there is a community of Muatana-al, that the Sanene deal with on an on-going basis.  Between the two neighbors there have been great pitched battles, small skirmishes and prolonged guerrilla warfare.  Every type of imaginable conflict has arisen at one time or another between them.  The following, however, is not about warfare.  It is about those Sanene known to their brethren as "the Collaborators."

Muatana-al Lore

Most Muatana-al consider having Sanene servants and slaves as more than natural: They consider it their birth-right.  According to their lore, the Chaos Lords first created the Sanene as a servitor race for the Muatana-al.  They needed servants that would not wander far from their masters, so they created the race with a strong aversion to sunlight.  They needed superior soldiers that could guard their masters during the day, so they created the race with great strength and a propensity for destruction.  They especially needed a race with the ability to endure and even welcome great horror; a race that would not go mad living among their life-draining masters.  What the Chaos Lords failed to infuse in the new race was a sense of servitude.  As a result, over the millennia, Sanene escaped their masters and established their own sovereigns.  This is the lore of the Muatana-al.

Sanene Lore

The Sanene, on the other hand, have a different version of history.  Their lore-books tell the tale of a Sanene isle free of all other races.  They tell of a great Muatana-al fleet sailing out of the seas of Chaos to invade.  The Muatana-al established their place on the isle by waging a bloody war on the Sanene.  In the Sanene histories the Collaborators make their first appearance by betraying their kind during this great invasion.  They lead Sanene hordes into death traps, murdered generals, and caused havoc among their own ranks.  This is the lore of the Sanene.

Fact

Whichever version of history one chooses to believe, the fact remains: the Muatana-al have never been without a servitor race.  A fleet of Muatana-al alone could never have crossed any sea: They would have needed sailors that could tack and trim a sail with the sun high overhead.  None have ever found evidence of a servitor race other than the Sanene that may have made such a crossing with the Muatana-al.  Indeed, all known facts point strongly in favor of the Muatana-al histories.

The Collaborator Clans

The Muatana-al refer to the Collaborator clans as "domestic breeds," and to the free Sanene as "wild breeds."  Over time, the Muatana-al bred their "domestic" Sanene to better suit different roles.  They bred great strength, and stoicism for heavy labor;  strength, ferocity, and magic ability for their armies; and grace, beauty, and artistic sensibility for their house servants and entertainers.

The Collaborators' skins are notably lighter than that of other Sanene.  This is, most likely, the result of numerous illegitimate births of mixed parentage (i.e., Muatana-al and Sanene).  It also serves to assure Collaborators of receiving no welcome from their "wild" kin, as their skin marks them instantly for death.  Further isolated, they have little choice but to follow their masters, and to live or perish along side them.

There are a total of twelve Collaborator clans living among the Muatana-al.  A Sanene Baron heads each of these twelve clans.  The freedom accorded these Barons and their immediate families is great, although they owe direct fealty to their Muatana-al lords.  They receive a small holding, consisting of a manor house and several acres of farm land that they hold in fiefdom from their lord.  The other members of each clan serve as Battle Thralls, Court Servants, or Laborers.  They are, essentially, slaves and their Muatana-al masters may use them as they wish.

Below the barons' families in rank are the Battle Thralls.  The highest ranked officers among the Battle Thralls are accorded almost as much privilege as a baron; and they receive a small piece of property in fiefdom upon which to build a house.  Although only the Muatana-al actually command whole armies, they are dependent on the Sanene Battle Thralls to defend them during the day.  As a result, Battle Thralls are perhaps the best treated of the Collaborator servants.

The rank of Court Servants is ambiguous.  The title includes all from scullery maids and food servers, to musicians and dancers.  A Court Servant's fate depends entirely upon their master.  There are some Muatana-al who so delight in pain and suffering, that assignment to Court Service is akin to being sentenced to death by torture.  Serving a master whose interest turns to the arts is far better.  Many lords have formed dance troupes, acting troupes, and orchestras from their more talented Court Servants.


Among the duties of fealty owed by both Baron and Battle Thralls; a number of Court Servants from among their own family must be supplied to their master.  It is believed the practice originated as a method of ensuring the loyalty of both Baron and Thrall by holding hostage members of their family.  The degree of familial attachment, or rather the lack of it, would seem to reduce the value of such bonds, and yet the practice continues.

The Laborers are little more than cattle.  When not working they are often kept under lock and key.  They are allowed out to work only with the supervision of a Muatana-al master, or a Battle Thrall.  Even so, the life of a Laborer is preferable to that of Court Servant under a cruel master.

The Thirteenth Clan

The existence of a thirteenth Collaborator clan has been rumored for ages.  A clan that secretly serves their Muatana-al masters while hidden among the free Sanene clans.  Often, this rumor has been used to denounce a rival clan; and many free Sanene clans have perished after being denounced as "the Thirteenth Clan."  Time has, in each case, exonerated these victims; and no hard evidence to support the theory of a "Thirteenth Clan" has yet found.

Conclusion

Traitors or slaves, there is little doubt that this portion of the Sanene race will never find safety among their own kind.  Indeed, the Collaborator clans are so infused with Muatana-al blood, that it may be inaccurate to refer to them as Sanene.  They are perhaps the first half-breeds of history; and, like many other half-breeds that have followed: They are detested by both sides of their heritage.

Funeral at Dawn
By Marigold Lyrian

 
This winter's morn the piper played, 
Sole grievance for the son
Of battles fought and lost; 
The soft tune melted 'round his grave,
As would the evening light 
Upon the frost; and yet no sun
Did ever shine so lonesome 
As it set, nor e'er so brave.
He slept, beneath the snow-packed earth, 
And would not rise again,
This boy, his manhood earned 
By payment of the blood he spilled,
Blood not of others, but his own; 
Lost in a fight he could not win,
Ghost of a vanquished army scattered 
O'er corpse-laden hills.
And as the wistful minstrel played, 
The victors marched on by,
And cast brief, puzzled glances 
At their mourning fellow's place,
But none dared say a word reproachful
At the shiv'ring specter's sighs,
So anguished was the look upon 
His tired and youthful face . . . 
Until at last they all had gone, 
And one alone remained,
Where all the others shook their heads 
And quickly hurried past,
He laid a hand upon the boy, 
So stricken and so pained,
And slowly, with a voice 
Of pitying wonder, gently asked,
"Why do you bury the enemy, 
When some of our own have died?
The war is over, soldier,
You should go home with the others."
The lad looked up and whispered, 
With the tears still in his eyes,
"One song, sir, is all I ask . . . 
For this man was my brother . . . "
And so the ghostly strains keened on, 
Died in the cold air's arms,
The kindred soul of separate warriors, 
Parted by the winter's tides,
In fatal twining of the stars, boys fallen 
From their winsome charms,
And gone too early, felled by that 
Which in the night abides.
This winter's morn the piper played, 
Sole grievance for the son
Of battles fought and lost; 
The soft sound faded in the sky,
As would the evening light upon 
The frost; and yet the sun
Wept bitterly behind the clouds, 
And would not shed her light.

For The Honor
By Tylar Vondracos


A Sanene priest wanders into the tavern late at night. A few patrons glance at him as he orders a glass of elven wine and sits down. He is obviously out of place, but he seems strangely vibrant this eve, perhaps he has already had a bit of wine. After a while his tongue begins to loosen, and he announces that he has a tale to tell to the crowd. A brief stir occurs as the tavern regulars wonder what sort of tale a Taathian priest might have to impart to them. He disappoints the few who were hoping for a tale of sacrifice and death, by telling them that this is a khat story. They have heard khat tales before, but they listen nonetheless, perhaps it will even be a new one. Then the priest begins his story . . . 

The smell of dawn was the first thing that Tai Kin'ra noticed. Even before his eyes opened, he sniffed at the air and caught a faint whiff of the docks. The captain had said that they would arrive today, though in truth Tai had doubted his words. He had been forced to travel on an ill made ship, manned by drunks and thieves. But he had been in a hurry and it was best not to use a Leuian ship under the current circumstances. The journey had been far too eventful for Tai, with several storms threatening to capsize the homely vessel. He did not fear death, he only feared the thought of not accomplishing his mission. The mission that the Pride had given him.

He washed himself the best he could in the water basin. His whiskers perked up a bit as he listened to the excited sailors above him. Yes, they were definitely close to their destination. He was a little surprised that this crew had even made the journey. Humans, weak pale creatures that they were, often surprised him. He walked out on to the deck to gaze at this new land, the Spur. He had heard many rumors about it. He had heard that great villains resided there as well as great heroes. Above all else, he had heard that it was a land of opportunity, opportunity to find fame and fortune or to end up lying dead in the gutter. 

He scanned the docks carefully, noticing each of the banners fluttering in the morning breeze. Tai's heart jumped when he saw the eagle of Odarous, and he said a silent prayer to his deity. Then he saw the banner of the serpent flying amongst the others and remembered why he was here . . . 

The Kin'ra family had been much respected in Leuia for many generations now. They were known as honorable khats and even though none had ever led the Pride, many had advised the leader and fought by his side. Even though their hometown of Khysonna was relatively small, it was often mentioned as a breeding ground for great warriors, mainly the Kin'ra's. Tai was no exception to his family's heritage. He had been trained as a Hand Cleric of Odarous since his infancy. He had achieved great prestige amongst his fellows, continuing his family's long history of honor. Unfortunately, his younger brother had not fared so well. Juo Kin'ra had been cursed since birth with a coat of black hair. This was most unusual in the Kin'ra family and the midwife had to be restrained from drowning what she considered a "devil" child. 

The family armsmaster had tried to instruct Juo to be a martial artist like his ancestors before him. However Juo lacked the patience necessary to master the precise punches and kicks. He preferred the blade and the power that it brought to him. With it, he could not evade or block as many attacks as his older brother but he could deal out more damage, Decisive damage in his eyes.

Juo often mocked his brother for the long hours that he put into his training. But there was also a hint of jealousy in those tones, envy that he could never be what his brother was in the eyes of the family

The family was disappointed that Juo had become a fighter and they often had heated arguments on the subject. After one particularly nasty row, Juo had left Khysonna and joined up with a passing band on mercenaries. Tai did not hear from his brother for many moons but eventually Juo returned to the Kin'ra house. He was very different when he returned, always a somewhat laid back khat, he now possessed a kind of intensity that made his family somewhat uncomfortable in his presence. He spoke of great battles he had fought in and the many lands and races that he had seen. But Juo still looked at Tai with those jealous eyes. Down at the local tavern, He showed off the many scars and trophies that he had amassed in his campaigns, and for a while he was quite popular since his peers had not had the good luck (in their opinion) of fighting in any battles.

This popularity was short lived however, during one particular rowdy evening at the tavern, Juo got into an argument with another Khat about where he had gotten certain "trophies" that were in his possession. He was accused of stripping the dead, which angered Juo into attacking the khat in question, severely injuring him. The local knights soon took Juo into custody for the assault and he was sentenced to be flogged. Not a very severe sentence since the Kin'ra family held some sway over the judge of the area. Nonetheless, when Juo was stripped of out of his leather jerkin before the flogging was to commence, the whole audience let out an audible gasp. The golden eagle mark that almost all of Leuia wore in honor of Odarous had been corrupted, tattooed over into the mark of the serpent. Juo had become a servant of Set. 

Juo wasn't flogged that day, but of course he was going to be hung the next. Tai went to see his brother in jail that evening. Juo looked surprisingly calm for one who was going to meet his death soon, but Tai tried to preach to him none the less. He implored his brother to turn back to the ways of Odarous, but Juo would have none of it. He did leave Tai with a cryptic remark, however:

"No matter what happens, after tomorrow you will see that I am better than you, better than this family, and better than this land. You call yourself a warrior, you are nothing but a stodgy priest, how many kills can you claim, how much gold have you amassed? I will show you what true power is and what it can do."
With that Tai hurried out of the jail, saying a silent prayer for his brother. 

Early in the morning, Tai rose and went for a walk to calm his mind. He would be the only one going to see his brother's execution, the other members of his family were too ashamed to show their faces. As he walked back towards town, there seemed to be some excitement going on. Picking up his pace, Tai walked into a scene of horror. The knights of the town were dead, their throats slit in the night. Their khits wailed as their fathers' bodies were carried through the town. The first warder of Khysonna was dead too, a serpent dagger through his heart. The townsfolk glanced at Tai as he wandered towards the jail. He already knew what he was going to hear. Juo had escaped and gone on a rampage. The final nightmare was yet to come. 

Tai had returned home as soon as he had heard the news. He came back to a silent house. The whole family lay dead around their breakfast, their tongues black with the poison that had killed them. Tai shrieked in agony and struggled to come to grips with what happened. Then a voice behind him spoke.

"You always let the pets drink from the well first Tai, if you were warriors you would know this."

Tai howled a fierce battle cry and leapt at the sound of the voice. Forgetting his martial arts training he slashed at Juo with his claws, trying to rip the very heart from his brother's body. Juo easily side stepped Tai's frenzied attacks and spoke.

"I had thought that had learned more at the temple than this . . . A shame you missed breakfast, now you have to die the hard way."

Tai screamed at him, "I will kill you and rip the mark of the serpent from your body!"

Then he clawed again and again at Juo, each time striking nothing but air. Juo had an almost amused look on his face.

"Time to die, dear brother."

With that he swung his black talon sword at Tai slicing neatly through his chest. Tai felt the hot sting of the blade drawing through him but still he came at Juo. The talon swung a second time cutting Tai's leg to the bone. Tai finally fell the floor blood flowing out of him in rapid bursts timed to the beat of his heart. Juo looked at his fallen brother for a moment.

"I told you I was better, perhaps now you will believe me."

He then plunged his sword into Tai's stomach. "Think on this in your last moments."

And then Juo was gone, fading into the shadows. Tai was nearly dead, even the will to live had gone out of him. He realized that he had failed at the very thing that he had spent his life training for. He had not been able to fight as a true paladin, measuring his blows with discipline and faith. He had attacked as a savage, no better than the battle cat that his father had given him as a child.  But as he lay there in his pain, he heard the cry of an eagle outside and remembered that he could not die here, with his family slain, its honor ruined. He cried out to Odarous to heal him, that he might restore honor to his kin and avenge their deaths. And Odarous listened, a glowing eagle appeared before him and his wounds stopped bleeding. Soon some townsfolk on a manhunt for Juo found him.

It took many months for Tai to recover fully, from both his physical and mental wounds. He visited the temple almost every day, becoming stronger in body and spirit. Then one day a member of the Pride came to see him.

"Your family has been disgraced by the actions of your brother, only you can restore your family's honor. You have one chance to bring him back here, alive or dead. He was last seen on a boat heading to the Spur, begin your search there, Perhaps you will fair better this time, but if you fail, be assured that someone else will follow you that will get the job done. Good bye Kin'ra."

Tai had mixed emotions about this statement, of course it was an opportunity to seek vengeance, but it was also an exile. He was no longer welcome here, not as long as this debt remained unsettled. So Tai gathered what belongings and coin he would need for the journey and made his way to the seaport. No one wished him farewell, not even his former Khat'sara.

He was forced to take a human ship to Spur, none of his race would have him on their ship once they heard his name. Khyshonna was not the only town that Juo had "visited."

And so Tai began his journey, a journey that could only end with his or Juo's death.

A Leuian Warsong
By Liontu Oskaloq

Drifting ambly in my sleep, fitfully I turn.
Something stirs me inside, and I feel the sudden yearn.
A cry wakes me from my dreams,  the sound of battle is heard.
The screech of the eagle,  our stoic war bird.
I  roar at the sound, it shakes through the earth, 
The fire blazes in me, like a stoked and furious hearth . . .

The call to battle has come, has come . . . 
And to it we all rush..
We fight and claw and roar with might!
We are the Leuian son . . . 

With a roar they leap to the battle that comes, 
Fighting on with might untold.
They carry on in the battle with courage, 
A courage that's strong and bold.

The battle rages on, never quitting will they, 
To every last Leuian they will stand.
Fear is not an option, but one to give, 
To an enemy and done so grand.

The call to battle has come, has come . . . 
And to it we all rush..
We fight and claw and roar with might!
We are the Leuian son . . . 

The field is left with our enemy torn . . . 
From the battle another fierce warrior is born..
Another day another time another place another fight . . . 
He shall carry on with honor and with courage and with might . . . 

His enemy has fallen, and he stands looking proud . . . 
His kin now gather, in a large forming crowd . . . 
The silence is now broken by the roaring of the clan . . . 
The enemy was vanquished, to the very last man . . . 

The call to battle has come, has come . . . 
And to it we all rush..
We fight and claw and roar with might!
We are the Leuian son . . .

Soliloquy	
Anonymous


A Go-blin-al beggar walked along Temple Way. It was night time, and the place tended to swarm with muggers, but the beggar wasn't worried. They never attacked him, because he never had any money, or anything for that matter. He had just walked past the temple of Elindale, when he noticed a flash of orange light. He scurried over to investigate. There were two men there, a live one, and a very dead one, a mugger with smoke coming out of the various burns on his body. The live one stooped over to pick up some items of the other. As he did, the Go-blin noticed pointed ears. An Elf. He looked on hungrily as the Elf removed a bag with the clink of coins in it. As he looked carefully at the Elf, he identified him as a San. He had dark skin, pitch black eyes, and reddish-black hair. He wore black leather armor, and an almost cloak-like black cape around him. The beggar decided not to approach him, as he tended to avoid all San, knowing he'd probably have a spell or dagger launched at him for his trouble. He was going to move on, when he realized the San was talking to himself.
	
"Why is it . . . .that I take such pleasure in the death of some, while I'm outraged at the death of others? Why is it . . . .that no matter how much we try to distinguish ourselves from animals and beasts, the strong still prey on the weak, and the fittest survive? Why is it . . . .that no matter how much I try to stick to the path of pure Chaos, I still find myself sliding towards Evil?"
	
The Go-blin was confused. This did not sound like a typical San. Oh, he knew there were many Spurian San who didn't fit the mold. The city actually tended to encourage such behavior, but this San was different. He was clearly Chaotic, and not particularly nice, but he seemed to question things other San took for granted. The San continued.
	
"When did it all start? When was it when I first started giving up on my original intent to spread Chaos without Evil? Oh yes, then."
	
The San touched his throat. When he removed his hand, the Go-blin noticed a scar he hadn't seen before. It was black, wider than most scars, and ran across his throat. No one could have survived something like that.
	
"It all started with Z'kai, everyone's favorite 'Sage', and his accursed Shadows, when I joined a group in the quest to destroy the source of the Shadows, a quest which failed miserably because of Z'kai's betrayal. The day Renalk died, and I was born."
	
The Go-blin logically deducted (as best he could) that this San was Renalk and that he was speaking metamorphically (metaphorically).

"Yes. When I was separated from the group, attacked by over half a dozen Shadow Spawn . When one of them stuck its claw in my throat and then ripped it open. I felt giddy, almost like laughing, when my own blood welled up in my mouth, though I can't see what I found so amusing at the time. I collapsed, and I died. My spirit screamed out to Sa for salvation, wanting nothing but revenge against my slayers, and I was restored to life. I knew I had lost something then. Myself most likely. I don't know who I am now, but I am not Renalk. Not the one I used to be. And now I am confused. But this wasn't the start of my confusion. Ever since the Muatanas invaded my home and my parents were killed, it was obvious my path would be different from most San. I was adopted by a Fir Elf, who was disguised as a San and was spying on us at the time we were overrun by the Muats. For a large part of my life I thought I was a Fir Elf. I didn't look all that different than them at first. But, I was still different. Although I wasn't as good at seeing through forest camouflage, I had better night vision, and my eyes had a sensitivity to light. As a result, I preferred shadowy corners, and was given the nickname 'Spooky'. I was stronger than anyone else in the village, but my archery skills weren't as good, and I could never make a decent bow. Eventually, as I grew older, it became obvious to everyone I was a San. I was much more muscular than anyone, and my black hair began to show traces of crimson.  I was tolerated at first, though almost everyone hated me. There were many times when I would be attacked by groups of Firs, and beaten by them. I turned to magick, as a way to defend myself, and regain respect in the community. Once, a group of young Firians attacked me. I was hit repeatedly and driven to my knees. That's when I decided to use the first spell I had learned. I moved my fingers in a pattern, and magickal energy started to form around them. I rotated my right hand a little, and it started to coalesce into runes. I brought my hands together and the runes started gathering above my head. Finally, I gestured towards one of my attackers and the runes flew towards him. While they flew they weaved together like strands, turning into a pellet of flame, eventually shaping itself into a Fire Dart. It exploded on him, charring his chest, and he fell. The rest ran away. I immediately took him to the healer, and by the barest of margins, he was saved. I was judged by the Council of Elders, the ruling party of the village. Although death was requested as a punishment by the family of that Fir, I was exiled , banned from ever returning.
	
"That is why I am different from other San. I hate Fir Elves for how they treated me, but I understand them, having lived among them. I had a hard time being accepted by the Spurian San. Rumor in particular gave me a hard time. He told me what he thought it meant to be San. But considering Rumor later converted to Elindale and was transformed into a Fir Elf, I can't put much faith in anything he said. Changeman told me of his philosophy of Chaos without Evil, and for a while, my confusion was ended, having decided that's what I would do as well. But Changeman is also gone now. For raiding the tomb of a Taathian High Priest he has been kidnapped, eventually ending up in the hands of his Taathian brother. Besides, I have been feeling too violent recently to follow that philosophy. The San have been weakened by the loss of some of their Chaotic members, and I feel it is my duty to strengthen them again. How can Chaos accomplish this task without its Evil component? It can't. I've been feeling rage constantly for the past month, and every time it flares up, my scar tingles uncomfortably, even hurts. The only bright spot since my death and rebirth has been talking to Maharet, the Secian daughter of Natiana. But yes, she is gone as well. Dead. Dead!"
	
The last word was yelled out so loudly , that the Go-blin was startled out of his hypnotic state, induced by Renalk's voice.
	
"The innocent die as much as the guilty, perhaps more. It doesn't matter who you are. And you, my little friend . . . . What have you learned from all this?"
	
It took the somewhat slow Go-blin a few moments to realize he was being spoken to. He was even more startled now. Renalk knew he was here all along! He tried to back away, but Renalk suddenly turned his head and gave him the "Move and you die" look. He advanced on the Go-blin, grabbed him by the collar, lifted him three feet off the ground, and pinned him against the wall of the temple of Sa. "Answer the question, wretch! What have you learned? What is the moral of this story?"
	
"Cho'kin me . . . ", the Go-blin said in broken Common. Renalk let off the pressure slightly. The Go-blin finally managed to scream out "Dat Kay-os ain't good witha't evil!"
	
Renalk smiled, "So you have been paying attention. Good."

He dropped the beggar to the floor. "Yes, my little scavenger. The moral of the story is that there are no morals. The only constant is death and destruction, the only guarantee and inevitability. Even with Death gone, there is still an end to each of our lives. Not enough favor with a deity or not enough money leads to death. Dying and coming back too many times leads to death. Getting old leads to death. Nothing is eternal except Chaos and Evil, the instruments of death themselves. It's a war out here, whether we like it or not, the survival of the fittest. And I for one intend to win it. From this day forward, the Good part of me is dead."

With that, he  stormed off, leaving a very confused and very, very, frightened Go-blin behind. The Go-blin shook his head to recover, than scurried off, wondering if he could sell this story for a few coins . . .

Freedom, prt. 1
By: L.A.H.

"Fight!"

At the sound of these word the crowd went wild. It was the first day of the games, a series of matches that pit one slave against another in a battle to the death. The fighters fight in a large open circle with surrounding walls. The walls were twenty-five feet high and a foot thick to prevent escape. Past the walls were the benches set aside for the peasants who paid the admission price of a silver piece( a weeks salary for some), who came for the sole purpose of watching someone else that was worse of than they were. Above them, on the second tier, sat the middle class, they had more money than the peasants, but not enough to buy them into nobility. Above them, on the third tier, which was suspended by magick, sat the nobility. Unbeknownst to the rest of the crowd a small section of the floor was hollowed out to make a seating area for the owners of the arena.

A small group of Muatana-al's ran the whole series of games through an Alarian they controlled by magick. The Muatana-al's supplied the fighters, and in return the crowd supplied the money the Muatana-al's used to live on for an entire year. 

As the words registered in Jaffle Prideclaw's mind, he quickly sized up his opponent. Standing at 5'8 he was rather small for a Leuian warrior, and his opponent , like most others, thought him easy prey. He saw his opponent, a burly Thugian barbarian, sneer in contempt at his meek opponent.

"This will be a fast match," said the Thugian loudly to the amusement of the crowd watching.

Jaffle just smiled.

Jaffle didn't bother to move until his opponent started to move towards him drawing his weapon in the process. Jaffle noticed his opponent used a huge blood-stained great sword, which meant if he got in close his opponent would be virtually without  a weapon. Jaffle quickly pulled out his slim drathain rapier, noting that he couldn't hope to block a blow from that huge sword, and in one fluid motion, leaped forward right next to the Thugian. The Thugian was stunned at the quickness of his movement, which gave Jaffle time to score a wicked slash across the throat of his opponent. Jaffle quickly jumped back, surprised that his opponent was still standing after receiving the mortal wound. He relaxed as he heard the Thugian gurgle out a plea for help then topple over.

"Winner of match one: Jaffle Prideclaw, owned by Kirl."

Jaffle shuddered at the thought of his master, a huge Muatana-al that trained him from birth to fight in the arena. One day he would escape and exact his revenge on him for the pain. Yes one day soon.

Jaffle watched as the Thugian's owner ordered some of his slaves to drag the body out of the arena. He knew that later the Muatana-al would have a feast. This thought made him shudder.

Jaffle glanced up as his owner as he walked up to chain him, so that he could not escape. As he look at his "master" in disgust, he decided that he would make a break for freedom at that moment. He quickly pulled his blade up and across, cutting a garish, if somewhat superficial blow to the Muatana-al's midsection. He new that to truly kill his master he would have to behead him. 

Somewhat stunned by the quickness of his slave, it took a moment for Kirl to respond to the disobedience. He quickly began a spell that would render his slave unconscious.  Jaffle realized the intent of the spell and slashed at his "masters" hands, slicing off more than a little of 3 fingers. The Muatana-al cried out and clutched his hand. 

"Mercy," cried the Muatana-al.

"No," Jaffle quickly replied as he slashed at the neck of his "master".

With his "master" dead Jaffle didn't know what to do. With the magickal slave mark branded on his hand, Jaffle knew that any one of his "master's" family could torture him from any distance. He knew what he had to do. He quickly ran out of the arena and down the street into a secluded alley. He drew out a small silver dagger he had hidden away in his pocket and set to work cutting off his left hand. As he neared completion of the process he started to pass out, but he said a quick prayer to Odarous for bravery and finished what he was doing. 

He quickly ran to the home of a healer his master had often visited, and after pleading with the man for a few moments, got the bloody stump of what was left of his hand healed in exchange for the silver dagger he carried.

He stumbled out of the healer's home and made his way to the house of his master. He would need money and supplies to make it out of the city, and what better place to acquire it than in the home of his late "master". At his former "master's" home he found a bag of gold and a large quantity of trail rations. In his room he picked up his belongings, which consisted of a few articles of clothing and a magickal pendant that showed the picture of a large city. He had stolen the pendant from his masters large collection of magickal goods (which was in a vault only his master knew the password for) many years ago. When he looked in the pendant he saw the city, and when he looked closely he could see people moving around on the streets of the city. Beneath the magick picture there was a caption that simply said "Spur". 

After stopping at his "master's" home he made his way out of the city. He walked for a day and a half before resting. He was thrilled at the thought of being totally free, and was amazed at the openness of the area. He had never been outside of the city in his entire life, and the fresh air and quiet sounds of the woods were more soothing than anything he had ever heard in the city.

Jaffle awoke later, and started back on his way after he had eaten a small amount of his travel food (he was used to eating little, and he knew he should save as much of it as possible). Nothing interesting occurred until midday, when a group of 6 humans coming from the opposite direction stopped him. They noticed that he was alone and the money pouch at his side was almost full and there was a small sparkle of gold coming from it.

"Give us yer money an' maybe we won't kill ye," the leaded of the group, a small human who was missing several teeth and one eye, stated clearly.

"I think not ruffian," Jaffle said defiantly. 

"Awright then boy, we'll jus' take it ourselves," spat another of the Humans, "get 'im."

Jaffle was confident that he could take these muggers safely under normal circumstances, but he was missing one of his hands. He pulled his rapier out in a practiced motion and circled around, watching all the men. He made a quick jab at the largest of the group, to test him, the man parried quickly and then his friends joined the fray. Jaffle feinted to the left and stabbed the human behind him in the chest. He quickly ducked and rolled to the left to avoid being beheaded by the hatchet one of the men carried. As he stood he swung out with his rapier spilling the entrails of his attacker on the road. He quickly parried a series of blows, but this put him on the defensive and he was sorely pressed. The battle was looking very grim. Suddenly there was a wild battle cry, Jaffle looked up and saw two Hithuals and a flerian charging into the fray. One Hithual brought out a large warhammer, while the other toted a double headed great axe. The Flerian stopped short of the battle and started moving his hands in complex patterns. A steady stream of fire flew from his fingertips to briefly sing the clothes on the nearest human. The human yelped loudly and ran off. The Hithuals quickly dispatched the stunned muggers, and turned to Jaffle.

"What're ye doin travelin these road by yerself youngin?", asked one of the Hithuals in a gruff voice. 

"Traveling," Jaffle replied, not knowing if he could trust these adventurers.

"Travelin," pondered the Hithual eyeing the place Jaffle's hands should have been,"It
appears ye jus' lost yer hand recently, why would ye want ta go out when yer in such bad shape?"

"That is my business, now thank you for the help in dispatching those rogues, but I must be on my way," said Jaffle.

"Where ye headed?", asked the other Hithual, obviously a female.

"I...," stammered Jaffle. He hadn't given much thought on where he was headed.

"I thought as much," said the other Hithual," care to join us?"

Jaffle looked at the traveling troupe, the Flerian was just now joining them after he rifled through the belongings of the dead.

"I suppose so, where are you headed?".

"We're headed ta tha Great city o' Spur," said the Female," Me name is Jill Seafarer, me kin here is Gromph Forgefire, and the Flerian there is Jamal Turbok."

"Pleasure to meet you all," said Jaffle," My name is Jaffle Prideclaw."

"Well let's be on our way," said the Gromph.

After traveling many many hours the group stops at an inn to rest and eat. Jaffle is amazed at the amount of ale the Hithuals consumed. He notices Jamal isn't surprised at all by the mass quantity of ale they have gone through.

"Why do they drink so much?", Jaffle asked Jamal.

"They are Hithuals, in case you didn't notice," stated Jamal.

"Ah," stated Jamal unsure of what this meant.

He used his spare time to check out his surroundings and his companions. The friendly female Hithual Jill seemed nice enough, but he remembered her smashing in the head of one of the rogues that tried to stop him without even flinching. He looked at Gromph next, he saw that he hadn't bothered to wipe the blood off his axe yet, and it appeared as if it had gone through quit a few battles. He inspected the Flerian next. The only weapon carried by the Flerian was a small quarter-staff.  Jaffle was about to ask how he protected himself when he remembered seeing the flames shoot from his fingertips.

"You know magick I take it?", he asked Jamal.

"Some."

"Do you know anything of magickal items?".

"Let me see."

Jaffle hesitates a moment then hands the pendant to Jamal.  Jamal inspects the pendant for a moment, and then his face lights up.

"Do you know what it is?", Jaffle asks.

"Yes it opens a portal to Spur."

"How?"

"By saying the magick phrase."

"That's it?".

"Yes."

The Flerian quickly hops off his bar stool and scurries towards the door still holding the pendant.

"Stop," exclaims Jaffle, "Thief!"

Jaffle quickly follows the Flerian out the door, the Hithuals right behind him. They get outside in time to see Jamal call out a phrase of unintelligible words, and a large blue portal open up. Jamal hops through the portal, followed closely by the Hithuals.

After floating through a blue mist for a few seconds the group is dropped into the middle of a bustling townsquare, right on top of a very angry fourth stage Dragon.
