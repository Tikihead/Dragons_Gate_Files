Dear Readers,

Welcome, one and all, to issue #11 of the DFC!  This issue is packed with goodies, including several works penned by the local Hithual population . . . Did someone tell these guys we were giving out free ale for published stories?

In other news, longtime contributor Aubrei Rashakae's name has finally gained a position with the rest of the official DFC staff.  Why?  Because he's the only other hired staff left, and his name would have looked really funny down there all by itself.  To this end, Aubrei has been granted the title of Editorial Footstool.  He's not getting paid any extra- or doing anything differently, for that matter.  But I needed something to write about in this section, and Aub likes having his name mentioned.

That being said, we do have a great issue for you this month . . . so go ahead and get reading!

Keep your harpstrings dry,

Marigold Lyrian
Editor-In-Chief

The Razing of Griffins Bluff
By Sturnan Ironjaw

Whenst I were a child, I didst live in Griffins Bluff.  It were a naught but a small farming village of little or no historic significance, and we were simple Hithual county folk.  In sooth, I doth fear that our village wouldst be long forgotten if it didst not live on in mine memories and in those of a few other kinsmen in the Spur.

Griffins Bluff were located in the lands of Earl Korum Blundergut, the famous Bread Basket Earl.  As many Hithuals mayest remember, our Earl were a vassal of Grand Duke Hirat Stoneshoulders.  Our lands didst feed the mines of the Grand Duke.  Although we were never a wealthy village, we were ne'er hungry and the ale were plentiful.

As the years go by, I doth forget more and more about mine simple, happy childhood, but there be one dark day that I shalt ne'er forget.  That be the day that I didst watch as mine village didst burn and mine kin didst perish.  To this day I canst not think on the day without seeing the look on mine mother's face as her body were broken.

It were a warm Autumn day during the Harvest Festival.  We hadst celebrated for almost a week after an unusually good harvest.  Ne'er hadst I seen such vast largess of ale.  All day didst we feast, and all night didst our parents drink and dance and make merry.  

Our only distraction were our thoughts of the lads that hadst left our village to aid the Grand Duke in his campaign against the Lord General Cotiaglo, the San Elf.   Having grown weary of the constant incursions by the renegade San Elf General, our Grand Duke hadst called out to all corners of his lands asking for recruits to take the fight to the Dark Elves.  He didst form the largest Hithual army history hath seen and led them against Cotiaglo, but that be a tale best told another time.

Howe'er, it were widely felt that the cause were just and that the Grand Duke were unbeatable. Whenst our older lads didst leave for the campaign, our village didst gather and wish them well.  I watched as Masher Cranium and the other older lads marched out of town in formation.  In sooth, they didst look smart, wearing the best weapons and armor the village couldst provide.  I doth remember mine jealousy of their chance to march off to glory and mine cursing of mine young age.

Howe'er, I wouldst soon experience far more "war" than any boy e'er should.  On that fateful afternoon, I didst play at a game of Hithball with many of the younger lads in the bare fields outside town.  An errant kick didst send the ball into a deep irrigation ravine, and I were sent to retrieve it.

Whilst I were in the ravine, I didst hear blood-curdling screams and grunts and other sounds of a deadly melee.  I didst scramble from the ravine to see a the most horrifying sight of mine young life.  Our village hadst been set upon by hundreds of blood-thirsty trolls.  They didst charge around with a savage purpose in their eyes, killing mine kinsmen left and right.
 
In sooth, we hadst no chance and didst put up little resistance.  Mine Uncle Durnam Sanchel, the village sheriff, didst attempt to rally our people to mount a defense, but we hadst few weapons or armor left and all but a few of our young men hadst left town to join the Grand Duke's campaign.  I didst see mine Uncle slay more than a few trolls e'er he perished.  Howe'er, as soon as he wouldst kill a troll, another wouldst rise from apparent death and set upon him anew.  Eventually, he didst fall under a sea of trolls, and they rip him apart and dine upon his flesh.

I didst scramble down the ravine and didst sneak into town.  In sooth, I were too scared to run from the village without mine parents and too scared to leave the ravine and be discovered.  Soon, I didst make mine way to mine boyhood home and thought for a brief time that mine father and mother wouldst protect me and that we might survive the day.

It didst take not long for this illusion to be shattered.  Mine crawling through the bushes to apparent safety were interrupted by every child's greatest fear.  Our front door didst shatter outward and mine mother and father were dragged into the street by several of the foul beasts.  I didst watch as mine father's head were caved in on the street by a huge troll and mine mother were ripped in two as others fought over their afternoon "meal."

In mine grief, all hope didst abandon me.  All I couldst think of were vengeance.  I didst grab a stone and leap from the bushes screaming mine hatred at the beasts.  I didst hurl the stone and hit a troll squarely 'pon his head.  Howe'er, I doth fear mine youthly arms couldst do no more than annoy the beast.

The troll didst set upon me with a savage hatred and hunger.  He didst grab mine arm and swing me 'round like a rag doll.  I didst feel bones shatter and screamed in pain and despair.  In sooth, I canst say little of what didst happen in the next few minutes, for it were all a haze of pain and blood.

Mine next clear memory were of the looking into a pair of wise and kindly Hithual eyes.  I couldst see the sorrow and compassion he didst feel.  I didst raise mine head to see another stout old Hithual split cleave the troll in half at the waist with a huge great axe.

"Now lay still and let me heal thee," said the kindly kinsman who didst hover o'er me.  He didst lay his hand upon me and I didst feel the power of Odarous flow through mine body for the first time.  Mine bones didst mend and mine pain didst cease.  I didst open mine eyes again to see a single tear flow down the cheek of mine benefactor.

"I be Brother Flintor, of the Order of Saint Gregarr the Smith, and thou art safe now child," he didst say to me.  I didst nonetheless gasp when I didst see a troll charge at us.  Brother Flintor's eyes didst harden and his countenance lost all of its compassion.  He didst begin to chant in some unknown language and weave symbols with his right hand.  To mine amazement the runes he hadst wove in the air didst fly towards the troll, and the foul beast were engulfed in a storm of flame.  The beast didst scream and fall in its tracks.

 Brother Flintor didst then stand and began to weave runes with his fingers anew.  Howe'er, on that second occasion, the runes didst fly to him bathin' him in a mystic aura and all the weariness in his countenance didst vanish.  He then didst pat me on the head and warn me to stay out of harm's way.  I didst sit for a few minutes and watch as Brother Flintor stood amidst the fray weaving runes into the air and launching all manner of spells at the trolls.  Verily, I didst feel certain that he alone were a match for all the trolls.

Ere I mislead thee, howe'er, I must needs sayeth that he were not alone.  In sooth, there were some two and one half score of the Brothers.  They were mostly Hithuals, but also a few humans and Leuians.  There were e'en a single Secian flitterin' 'round the field of battle and healin' the other Brothers.  They were a deadly and efficient bunch when provoked, and provoked they were on that day.

At some point in the battle, thundering explosions of flame and debris didst erupt from the huge barns that didst house our grain harvest.  The flames didst spread throughout the village and there were naught the Brothers couldst do to stem its spread during the melee.  It didst not take a sage to see that the village wouldst soon be destroyed along with its people, and none couldst halt the destruction.

Nonetheless, I doth thank Odarous for his divine providence on that day.  If not for the intervention of the Brothers of Gregarr, I doth feel certain that I wouldst hath surely perished.  On that day, those few Brothers didst provide a model for this Hithual to aspire towards for all mine life.

Howe'er, it shouldst not be inferred that I didst sit idle for all the fray.  Ere the battle were over, a strong Hithual hand didst grasp mine shoulder and pull me to mine feet.  I didst look upon the largest Hithual that I hadst e'er seen.  He were a full four feet tall and at least 350 pounds.  I didst recognize him as the same kinsman who hadst smote the initial troll with his great axe, although now the axe and his person were caked with blood, both troll and Hithual.

"I be Brother Moram, and I didst not save thee only to see thee sit and watch, boy," he sayeth and thrust a long dagger in mine hand, "Now thou shouldst stay close to me."

Only just then, a troll didst charge towards us.  One of her claws were extended at us and Hithual blood didst drip from it.  She didst hold her left arm close to her chest, cradling something.  Brother Moram didst strike the troll a fierce blow to her head, and she didst fall on her back.  I didst leap into the fray and slashed at her with the dagger.  Finally, Brother Moram didst finish her off with his great axe.

She twitched for a moment and then her body went limp.  As her left arm fell to her side, an almost newborn troll whelp didst roll from off her chest.  It didst scream a terrible wail, and mine heart didst wrench.

"This be all senseless and there be more at hand than we now know," sayeth Brother Moram, and I didst see the pain in his eyes.  He didst scoop up the babe and comfort it.

 Suddenly, the troll's body didst begin to twitch.  After a few brief seconds, she didst rise and stare at us.  Moram didst offer the babe to her, and she didst snatch it away from him.  With a loud snort, she didst run off out of town and into the forest, holdin' the child tight as she ran.

The battle were thankfully short after that.  Soon the trolls were either killed or scared away from the village.  Only then didst we take time to gather the survivors.  I didst weep long and hard to see the scant few of us who had lived.  Of the over 120 residents of the village, less than ten didst survive that day.  All but I hadst relatives elsewhere, and the others didst flee the village for other parts on that same day.  As I hadst no livin' relatives the Brothers didst agree to take me into their monastery and raise me to serve Odarous.

I shouldst also note that we didst make a surprising discovery on that day.  A battle-weary Leuian didst stride up to Brother Moram draggin' a San Elf behind him.  He didst tell Brother Moram that the San Elf and a few others hadst set the fire in the barns.  Further, after much persuasion, the San Elf didst admit that similar attacks were occurring throughout the lands of our Earl.

The San Elves hadst collapsed the caves that housed the trolls and destroyed their food.  The trolls hadst been driven into our lands by hunger and lack of shelter.  Twas the dark Lord General Cotiaglo's plan that the trolls wouldst provide ample distraction for the destruction of the food stores throughout our land.  We didst later learn that the stratagem were amazingly successful and that nearly all of that year's harvest were destroyed.  E'en at mine young age, I didst grasp the significance of the news and knew that it wouldst be a long and hungry campaign for our Grand Duke's forces.

But once again, that be a tale for another time.  I didst learn much in mine time in the monastery and were loathe to leave it.  Howe'er the Brothers didst send me forth to spread the word of Odarous and to oppose evil in the realms.  I didst eventually make mine way to the Spur and hath found a home among its residents.  The kinsmen I have found here are without equal, but there be much honor in all of the races.

Mine greatest joy hath been to find that a few of the scions of Griffins Bluff hath survived and migrated to the Spur.  As I hath alluded to previously, Masher Cranium didst survive the Grand Duke's bloody campaign, although he be loathe to speak of it.  As in Griffins Bluff, he doth always have time for we younger Hithuals, and I be glad to see he hath risen to such high esteem in the Colinth Argonix.

Additionally, I were also fortunate enough to find that one of mine kin hadst in fact survived the razing of our village.  Chaise Sanchel, daughter of the great Durnam and cousin to this Hithual, doth wander the Spur e'en now.  She were apparently rescued by a lone healer, but that be her story and best told by her.

I wouldst call out to any other Hithuals who are survivors of Griffins Bluff or of any of the villages destroyed in the great troll invasion to contact me.  Thou willst find a kindred soul.  To all others, I wouldst say beware duplicity and oppose evil in all its forms.

I remain,
Sturnan Ironjaw,
Charitable Sword of Odarous,
Defender of the Faith and the Keg,
Member of Colinth Argonix

Temporal Mechanics and You
(from the notes of Vermire)

Time, as it stands, is an element beyond which most people may aware.  They constitute such temporal pulses and waves towards 'fate', or the gradual fading of life towards 'old age', not realizing that which they step upon.

While even this order cannot begin to explain the nuances of such a universal elemental, living as it is near the time of a split in the eternal stream, it has given a chance beyond most others to study its effects.

To demonstrate, there is one thing left of pride that should be taken away.  Pride of the generation. For every waken man of his age upon venerable times, there is a man who suffers from one of the most serious, yet most underscored aliment: Temporal Disjunction.

For understanding this, note that at the time of a linear creature's birth, they are perfectly aligned with the ebbs and flows of Time, as it were.  The farther they get from that time of alignment, by natural aging or
artificial methods, the more out of tune they become. They start losing their sense of change, and try and cling to the past.

To stop this, one must overcome the first obstacle of the Temporal traveler.  They must understand Chaos, Change. Nothing is sterile in the dirt and soil  of the galaxy. If they continue to believe that the next generation knows nothing, or that they bode no well, the psychological impacts merely compound the Disjunction effect. To wit, this is the much vaunted "Generation Gap".

I say to any who seek this, when you become old, and wise. When you see that there is more of the new and less of the old, and continue feeling of their incompetence. It is then time to put down your arms, your empire, and your fears. You shall be presented with a choice, that of acceptance into the black, or that of delivery to the black.

It is possible to cheat 'Time', but to do so would mean a person or legacy must become non-linear. A price that must surely cost dearly. For how could we feel emotion if we could see all objectively? How could we develop hatred that shapes and hardens us of an uncaring galaxy, if we plot our lives attempting to avoid it?

For a hero, especially in a time of a generation of them, it is possible to cheat Time, to become legacies. But it only lasts so long. There comes a time when one must finally throw away their pride, their being, and their
existence. There comes a time when one generation must be gave space.

For some lands, that time is now.

The Power of a Word
By India Oskaloq


A blow can leave a mark
sometimes unseen to the eye
but an insult leaves a scar
just as damaging as any lie . . . 

With a twist of your blade
the words cut down deep
no I surely will not die
but these scars I will keep . . . 

A word has the power
to make a child cry
it even has the power
to make one say "goodbye" . . . 

Words can bring tears
or a smile to a face
they can make a day brighter
or make shorter a race . . . 

They can give one some hope
and chase away the dark
make one love another more
as they share dreams in a park . . . 

A scars mark is forever
some never fade at all
think carefully before you speak
lets break down this wall . . . 

The past cannot be lost
when the scars are still worn
but don't look to me with hate
don't look at me with scorn . . . 

This pain has made me stronger
made me see things in a way
I never can accept the word quitter
for that is just not my way . . . 

This pain has made me feel
for all who have suffered with me
I embrace them with no question
 for it is their pain that I see . . . 

So my heart seeks them out
wishing to lessen their hurt
I want to make them happy
while deep down I feel like dirt . . . 

But that is my choice for life
aching from this pain in me
for if I did not do this
who would I truly be? . . . 

So continue on I must
never give up will I
for when there's no reason to fight
only then shall I die . . .

Defeat of a Shadow Disciple
By Meqetlh Forgefist

Those were dark days for the city of Spur. Literally, as well as figuratively, a dark shadow covered the city. Lord Z'kai the Master of Shadows, and Chantrel Veritas his Disciple of Shadows, had been terrorizing the people of Spur for many days, bringing invasions of shadows and shadow spawn with them.  No one had yet been able to defeat them.  Nothing seemed able to pierce their shadowy defenses.

My liege, Lady Demeralda, had willingly given herself over to them, in exchange Lord Z'kai was to leave Spur and the people there alone.  Lord Z'kai betrayed his word, continued to plague Spur, and did something to Demeralda, cut something out of her.  I had yet to speak to my liege after this had happened, so I did not know for sure what had happened to her.  All that I did know was that I was very worried about the fair Secian.

Early in the morning of the fourth day of the seventh month in the year 306, I entered Town Square to find a large crowd of Spur's defenders.  Also in the middle of the crowd stood Chantrel, who was, as he put it, keepin' an eye on his Master's city for him while Z'kai was away.

The clerics of Spur had decided that Z'kai and Chantrel fed on battle and conflict, and the best course of action was not to fight them at all, at least until a way was discovered to defeat them.  So, the people of Spur were for the most part following that advice on that morn.  No battles were raging when I entered the square.

I eyed the Disciple of Shadows over.  The human stood almost a full two feet taller than me, making him about five foot seven or five foot eight. He had collar length, neatly kept, fine dull black hair.  His dull black eyes had a distant look to them.  On his chest was a tattoo of a spreading shadow.  He wore heavy hard leather mail, covered by a mantle of shadows.  In his weapon hand he held a short shadow blade.

I was dressed for battle myself.  My Hithual forged steel scale mail was firmly fastened in place, and my pure white steelwood kite shield was strapped to my arm.  I had my silvery steel katari in hand, as'n my Hithual forged bluesteel great axe was sorely in need of repair.

While I was sizing up Chantrel, a thief came up to me.  He whispered that he needed to speak with me, that he had some information about Z'kai.  I shall not state the name of the thief here, but I had found him helpful in the past.  Now, I knew good and well that this thief only passed on to me what information that he wanted to, and that he always did it to further his own interests.  Nonetheless, I had ne'er yet found what he said to be untrue, or unuseful.  I agreed to follow him.

While makin' the whispered arrangements to meet with him, I saw something out of the corner of my eye.  Someone that I did not know reached out from among the crowd and poured poison on the katari that I currently wielded.  At first I doubted my eyes, as my attention was divided between Chantrel, the thief informant, and the crowd.  Surely it but be my imagination, I thought.  As I followed the thief to one of his 'offices', I could not help but notice that indeed there was a poison substance on the blade of the katari.

My mind raced.  Who put the poison on the katari, and why?  To defeat Chantrel?  I hardly heard the thief as he spoke on a secret movement by one of Spur's nobility to bring down Z'kai.  I was too preoccupied by my own thoughts.  It seemed very distasteful to me to use a poisoned blade against an enemy.  But, what if I did not, and this was the only chance Spur had against Chantrel.  I realized that if I debated the matter too long, the poison would dry, and be of no use against Z'kai servant.

I told my thief contact that I had to cut the meeting short, that I had to return to Town Square, and face Chantrel.  I decided to give Chantrel every chance to retreat, and to pull the shadow forces out of Spur, before attacking his with the poisoned blade.  'Twas the best I could do, to make sure honor was satisfied while not squandering Spur's best change for the Shadow Disciple's defeat.

I strode purposely into the middle of Town Square, up to Chantrel, and ordered him and his forces out of Spur, or I'd attack him.  Predictably, he refused.  And so I attacked!

With a slightly bemused expression on his face, Chantrel avoided my every stroke!  His agility seemed almost magickally enhanced.  Some of the crowd told me that it was useless to try to hit him with a weapon, that none could land a blow on him.  Others cried out that I should not fight him, that I was playing right into Z'kai hands.  My determination grew, however, and I thought mayhaps if'n I hit him just once, it'd be enough.

While I battled against Chantrel, my poison-tipped steel katari seemed to change, until it became a poison-tipped shadow katari!  And finally, one blow did strike him!  His eyes betrayed surprise, and he suddenly was much easier to hit.  I'm still not sure if'n a magickal enchantment had been broken, or if'n the poison served to slow his reflexes.  Sensin' that the Disciple of Shadows was weakened, the other defenders of Spur jumped in and started attacking Chantrel as well.

The metal-clashing song of combat roared through Town Square, and fierce battle danced across the brilliantly carved flagstones.  Radiant runes of every color and shape flew through the air.  Chantrel Veritas fought well, and every blow or rune that landed would cause him to be briefly silhouetted by a pale blue glow.  He was obviously being protected by some magickal means.  However, he was soon worn down, taking a beating from all sides, and looked as if he might pass out from his wounds at any moment.

To escape his attackers, Chantrel rose to about thirty-five feet in the air.  Momentarily safe, he panted, tired from all his exertions.  He only had a moment to rest, as the Drakes Aneurysn and Vikoa flew into the air to claw at him, and Urfy the Fir Elf attacked with his bow.  Chantrel easily knocked the Drakes from the sky with his short shadow sword, and sent bolts of dark energy lashing out from his hand at Urfy.  While he seemed able to hold his own while out of reach from most of us, he still looked very weak, and seemed like he could falter and loose consciousness at any time.

I said to Chantrel, "Ye can still leave, ye are yer master, return what has been taken, and we shall not go after ye."

The battle raged on.  Blackcrow readied his short bow and joined Urfy in firing arrows at the flying Human.  Chantrel by this time was too busy knocking the Drakes to the ground repeatedly to give the missile attackers any attention.  "Talking to him is like talking to a brick wall . . . ," commented Talana.  Some of the other adventures began yelling to Chantrel to land.

I knew that I could do more good with the shadow katari than with my bow, so hoping someone would be able to psi-fly me, I asked, "There be any psions here?"

Quick as a blink, Chantrel disappeared.

As we looked at each other in confusion, we heard the voice of Chantrel say, "This is highly unusual.  I must see my Master."

At this, we started taunting Chantrel.  Responding to one of the taunts, his voice said, "You didn't even scratch me, Fool."  His voice then said, "I just wish to know how one of you got a shadow blade."

More taunts were answered by an attack of shadow spawn!  Well over two dozen of the vile creatures struck us, scattering several people.  The rest of us held our ground.  Weapons and claws sliced through them, spattering them into a million blobs of shadow, dissipating them.

Once the area was secure again, I sat down and treated the puncture wounds on my arms.  Looking about, I saw two more spawn to the East.  I stood up and went east.  Khateul joined me, and quickly there were two less shadow spawns in Spur.  Khateul went north, and I continued east through the long, low archway out of Town toward the arena in search of more spawns.  I found and destroyed several more spawn along Condemned Walk.  Afterward, I headed back to Town Square.

There was no sign of Chantrel in Town Square, and no more shadow spawns either.  I decided to go southeast toward the Justice Quarter, to see if more spawn might be found down that way.  Walking along Justice Street, I found no sign of any spawns.  Suddenly a feeling of suspense gripped me and I felt like something important might happen any moment.  I searched the shadows, several times, hoping to find Chantrel hiding there.  Alas, I found nothing.

I called out, "Chantrel, if'n yer hidin' in those shadows, show yerself."  If'n he was indeed there in the shadows, watchin' me, he did not show himself.

After looking about a bit more, I stopped to think.  I looked at the morning sun as it slowly worked its way up the sky.  Mayhaps Chantrel was shy in the daylight.  If'n I was in a darkened area, mayhaps it'd be easier to lure him out.

I quickly headed back to Town Square, and crossed north, to the Travelers Hostel.  As most of the adventures in Spur know, there be a trapdoor hidden in the Travelers Hostel that leads down to the sewers.  

As I search the room and found the trapdoor, I noticed that the shadows around me were glistening slightly.  Indeed, Chantrel was watching me!  I searched the room again, and again I failed to find the Disciple of Shadows.  As if'n to mock or threaten me, the shadows pulsated with dark energy.

I went through the trapdoor and down the stairs to the sewers.  I stood on the bank of the Darkith, the roar of the underground river echoin' around me in the absolute darkness.  I awaited Chantrel to make himself known.  I did not have to wait long.

Soon I heard the voice of Chantrel say, "I demand a battle with you."

I answered, "A battle ye say, I ne'er refuse a duel."

The poisoned katari gleamed and Chantrel's voice said, "I will have your shadow weapon."

"I don't think it like ye very much," I replied, while searching for and again not finding the dark Human.

Chantrel stepped out of the shadows as'n another might step out of a curtain.  He rubbed his short shadow blade.  Shadows circled around, creating an arena of darkness for the upcoming battle.

The Disciple of Shadows and I circled each other.  I awaited him to strike.

Glaring at Chantrel, I said, "What I want, 'tis to know what was done to Lady Demeralda"

"That is easy," Chantrel said.  "Lord Z'kai took her to his lair.  He took his shadow dagger, and cut out her liver with it."  He smiled.

An anger began to flare deep within me, hotter than the mightiest forge-fires of the Great Divide.

"It was very tasty," Chantrel said, laughing.

Trembling with an anger I had ne'er before felt, I attacked Chantrel!  The poison tipped shadow katari missed wide of the mark.  He swung back at me, and I was just barely able to avoid his short shadow blade.  Trying to get control of my emotions, I swung again, this time striking a good blow to his right leg, sending him down hard to the ground.  While prone, he swung at my right leg, but with difficulty I was able to deflect the blow with my pure white steelwood kite shield.

Still seething with anger over what he said about Lady Demeralda, I exclaimed, "Ye shall pay for that!"

Chantrel stood up and the battle continued.  I landed blow after blow on the Human, and with each blow, I regained a little more control over my emotions.  Every blow of his I managed to dodge or block with my shield.

"For Lady Demeralda!" I cried out, striking him again, this time on the arm, with the shadow katari.  Chantrel growled with anger.  Again I continued to strike him, while his shadow blade only found steelwood or air.  It was beginning to look like I'd be able to easily defeat the Disciple.

Suddenly, Chantrel melted into the shadows right before my eyes, reappearing a moment later behind me.  Catching me off guard, his short shadow blade struck me in the side of my torso, cutting through my Hithual forged steel scale armor as if'n it be but scroll paper.  I stumbled and fell to the ground.  He swung again, landing a strong blow on my left leg.  The pain was surprisingly piercing.  I quickly stood and struck Chantrel across the right leg.

Chantrel was cackling in delight.

"Neat trick," I said, smirking.

Chantrel again hit me, this time on the left arm, cutting another deep slash into my flesh.  I was getting in trouble fast.  The battle were victory had seemed so sure only moments before was swiftly threatening me with defeat.  I quickly removed a yellow health potion from my large leather backpack and took a drink. Its magickal properties brought renewed strength, and I felt healthier, but the slashes were still bleeding and I was still quite weak.  While I deflected a couple more blows, I drank a few more gulps of the magickal potion.  I then sat to treat my wounds and stop the bleeding.

Chantrel took the opportunity to strike a harsh blow across my right arm causing me to groan in pain.  I did manage to treat my wounds, however, and stop the loss of my precious lives blood.

I stood to resume battle, and watched as the shadows about us reached out and healed Chantrel's wounds.  He still had an ashen look to his face, so I ignored the shadows and pressed on the fight with Chantrel.

Our combat proceeded, with my katari and kite shield serving me well.  I exclaimed, "Mayhaps I'll take yer liver in payment for Demeralda's!"

As if'n answer, Chantrel struck a good blow to my left leg, cutting through my scale mail as a Hithual would cut through a tankard of fine ale.

As I drank the last of my yellow health potion, Chantrel said, "My master will enjoy your head on a platter."

Chantrel proceeded to land a quick succession of harsh hits, sending me to the ground.  I grunted in pain, and once again my fate seemed bleak.

Confidently, Chantrel said, "You will die, fool."  Cackling, he pressed his attack.  I pulled another yellow heal potion and drank it dry, barely saving my life.  Because of the numerous deep slashes covering my body, I was forced to take the time to apply some much needed first-aid.

Standing, I resumed attacking Chantrel.  I proceeded to land a quick succession of hits on him, while deflecting his own blows on me.  He then landed a shot to my head just as I struck him in the leg.  Finally overcome by his wounds, he died.  Chantrel's body fell lifeless to the dark floor.  Sheathing my katari, I sat down and bandaged the wound on my head.

I exclaimed, "By Odarous, what a battle!"  And yet, as I spoke those words, I realized that I had missed something.  The battle had indeed been a great battle.  However, I was so blinded by my anger that I failed to enjoy the combat as normally I would have.  Even in my victory, Chantrel had cheated me.  Cheated me of the joy I feel when I'm in a mighty battle.  A lesson learned, I told myself, and a mistake I'd not make again.

Chantrel's form shimmered and seemed to melt slightly.  Looking about, I was once more standing on the river bank, at the bottom of the stairs leading back to the Travelers Hostel.

Chantrel's ghost said, "My master will still destroy you and everyone you love.  Count on it."

I responded, "I've heard worse threats."

The ghost continued, "You cannot kill him as you killed me.  He is Immortal!"

"One way or another, he shall be defeated," I said.

"Never," asserted Chantrel's ghost.

And then, without warning, Z'kai descended from the shadows.  Hovering about fifteen feet up in the air, he frowned down at Chantrel.

Z'kai gestured upwards with his hand, and Chantrel's body rose like a puppet.  Once again breathing, the Human hung five feet above the ground.

Glancing at the Sanene Lord, I said, "Ye need to return what was takin' from Lady Demeralda."

Ignoring me, Lord Z'kai frowned and said, "You have failed me, Chantrel."

His Disciple protested, "No master . . .  He had a blade . . .  I could not stop it.  It is the Shadow power that failed!"

"You are not worthy to serve me," Z'kai said, and he pulled his hand back with a heavy gesture.

Chantrel cried out, "Please!  Another chance!"

Z'kai shook his head from side to side.

Kneeling mid-air, Chantrel begged, "Please Lord!"

Z'kai said, "You have failed my mission. I will have to take Spur by myself."

Chantrel began to pail and wither as Z'kai made numerous gestures in the air.  Chantrel crumbled to the ground, dead!  Then his corpse turned to dust!

The Lord of Shadows quickly landed and picked up his servant's short shadow blade.  He then took a few steps and soared high in the air again.

The San Elf shook his head from side to side.  "Impressive, Hithual.  Impressive.  But this shall not happen again," he said, again shaking his head from side to side.

I said, "It seems Odarous has blessed me this day, ye will ne'er stand against the power of our gods."

Z'kai began to spin in the air rapidly, shadows entwining him.  He promised, "I shall return!"

I stated, "I will see ye pay for what ye've done to my Lady, not a threat, but my word."

And quicker than a Hithual can say ale, the Lord of Shadows was gone.

I picked up the mantle of shadows, heavy hard leather mail, and large leather backpack that laid on the ground.  I'd later take the leather mail and backpack to Temple Odarous, and donate them to my god, in thanks and appreciation for all he's done for me, and seeing me through the battle to victory.  I kept the mantle of shadows for myself.  My silvery steel katari soon after returned to normal.  I learned that Lady Demeralda had returned to normal as well, completely recovered from her ordeal.

Z'kai was later defeated in battle in Town Square, and has for the time being left Spur.  He still remains a threat, howe'er, and will no doubt return to try to torment Spur again.  Sometimes at night, I awake in a cold sweat, havin' had a nightmare that the Shadow Lord had made good on his Disciple's threat, and that he was destroying my loved ones.  But I have faith that Odarous will ne'er let Z'kai stand in victory o'er us, and that his day of final defeat be coming!

The Journal of Masher Cranium's Youth
by Masher Cranium


Entry one:

Each day it grows harder on mother raising us on her own.  Things have been very different since father died.  I have decided to head out to the farmlands of Griffins Bluff to find work.  It's almost planting season, and I'm hopeful that there will be something there for me.  Mother could use the extra silver, and one less mouth to feed would be a help.  As I will be away from my family for a while, I have decided to keep this journal so that I can share my "adventures" later.

Entry two:

While mother didn't take the news of my leaving well, Griffins Bluff is very nearby and I have found work on a small farm just outside of town.  Odarous is truly looking down upon me-50 silver per week plus food and lodging.  The loft in the barn is surprisingly warm and comfortable.

Entry three:

It's been 6 months now and the harvest is coming soon.  I've had little in the way of "adventures" but grew tired of waiting for something exciting to write in the journal.  I feel myself growing stronger with each swing of my scythe, and each hay bail I toss.  I've been a very hard worker, and I'm certain they will keep me on through the winter.

Entry four:

An interesting thing happened today.  A man stopped by while I was working in the wheat fields.  He was a mountain of a man, at least 4 foot three and nearly as wide.  He asked me if I'd ever considered military service or weapons training.  Said I looked like a "natural" the way I was swinging my scythe and offered to train me some at week's end. I think I'll take him up on it, as I can't see myself as a farmer the rest of my life.

Entry five:

It's finally week's end, and I have worked extra hard to have all my work finished early.  Today I see the man about learning to use weapons
	

Entry six (same day):

What a day!  The man's name is Durnam, and he also happens to be the local sheriff.  I'm more than a little bruised and cut-up from the sparring, but the things I've learned!  I think he was right-I am a "natural."  A sword feels very good in my hand (I'm sure father would be proud as he was quite the swordsman).  Master Durnam offered to teach me over the winter, until planting season comes.

Entry seven:

Life continues to get better here.  We've moved on to blunt and pole weapons training, and after the change of season we will be using bows in the forests nearby.  It's been 3 months since the harvest, and almost time for the New Year celebration.

Entry eight:

What a party!  All of Griffins Bluff and the surrounding farms turned out. There were all manner of games, peddlers and traveling bards.  There was also the most remarkable woman there, I believe her name was Kalistyn. She was actually able to take control of another's mind. We all had a great laugh when she caused that little terror Krenam Granitefists to be so confused he couldn't move!  I dare say the other children had a great time pelting him with foodscraps while they had the chance, and hoisting him up the flagpole by his undergarments (I think his parents secretly enjoyed it as well). Perhaps he won't be such a bully now that he's gotten that comeuppance.  She could even speak to us, though her lips were not moving!  No one had ever seen such things before.  Master Durnam was there, accompanied by his daughter Chaise.  I know not where he's been hiding her, but I'm certain I know why-she's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.  It's not just her looks, it's something more: her attitude? her strength?  and strong she is:  she jumped right into a game of Hithball and scored twice!  I'm a bit embarrassed to say she ran me over for one score.  I hope to see her again, but who knows . . . she's not much of a talker.

Entry nine:

It's been 3 months since the New Year, and the ground is beginning to thaw.  Almost time for planting again. That also means it's time to hunt with Master Durnam.  I think leaving home was the best decision I have ever made.
	
I spoke with Chaise today!  We ran into each other by the stream, as we were both fetching water.  She's even more beautiful than I remember.  I'll be sure to fetch some water tomorrow at this time too.

Entry ten:

I've been fetching water for a week, and no sign of Chaise.  This being weeks end, Master Durnam and I will be hunting squirrels and such in the forest.

Entry eleven:

Imagine my surprise on waking and finding a note from the lovely Chaise, stuck in the barn door.  She wishes to meet me tonight by the stream where we accidentally mat a few days ago.  Naturally, her father can't know we are meeting, and I hate to do it secretly, but I must see her.  Master Durnam is not a bad man, but he is a hard man, and I'm sure he'd not want his daughter to meet one such as me in the middle of the night.

Entry twelve:

Again, Odarous is smiling down upon me.  I can't sleep for thinking about Chaise.  We talked for hours. I can scarcely believe we have so much in common, let alone that she's even interested in me at all.  

She walks with a calm resolve and displays an amazing amount of confidence for one so young.  I often forget that I am older than her when we are together.  There is a determination in her eyes that others may mistake for hardness, but I have watched those eyes soften.  I once saw a field of wildflowers on the other side of the stream.  I swam across and picked a bouquet of them for her.  She laughed and told me that I looked like a drowned rat, but I could see from the warmth in her eyes that she was touched.  There is a depth to those eyes that is both fascinating and terrifying in its intensity.  She is no simple bar wench, but a challenging and amazing young woman.

Entry thirteen:

My thoughts of Chaise grow more frequent and intense, as do our meetings, causing my trips home to more infrequent and more brief.  Perhaps I should stay in this place called Griffins Bluff and be a farmer after all, though I can occasionally best even Master Durnam while sparring.  There is some talk in town of fighting off in the distance, and more than a few of the townsfolk are worried about it. 

Entry fourteen:

I have never been happier.  Today, Chaise gave me a ring woven from her hair.  The gift is almost as beautiful as the giver.  As the emotion overtook me, I gave her my grandma's amulet.  It had been left to me when she died, and I was instructed to give it only to my wife.  I hope that my mother will not be too mad.

Entry fifteen:

Disaster today-Master Durnam caught Chaise and I walking through the forest (holding hands no less)!  He must have known something was going on, as I have been preoccupied while hunting, and a terrible shot with the bow.  He is furious-never have I seen him so angry.  More surprising was Chaise's reaction to him.  My strong young flower backed down.  I think she would spit in the eye of a demon before retreating, but she seems intimidated by her father.  This is the first time that I have seen her cry and I will never forgive Durnam.

He has forbidden us to see each other, despite our protests.  My last vision of Chaise was her crying as he led her home.

Entry sixteen:

I've not seen Chaise in a week, nor have I seen Master Durnam.  I feel an emptiness I've never felt before, not even when father died.  I care little about my work on the farm, or my weapons training (should Master Durnam care to continue).

Another week has gone by, with no sign of Chaise.  There is more bad news (maybe welcome news at this point).  A messenger rode into town today, leaving a note on the board in town square: I have been drafted into military service.  Grand Duke Stoneshoulders' army is about to go to war, I know not with whom.  Nor do I know how the Grand Duke came to hear of me, but I'm not the only lad to be called.


Entry seventeen:

Master Durnam himself woke me this morning, and I was doubly surprised when he offered me a fine double bladed axe of his own forging, finer than any weapon I've ever seen in his possession.  That surprise turned to uneasiness, as I realized he was the one that put forth my name for military service.  Arguments and protests were not necessary, as that die had been cast, and the look on his face did little to hide the fact that he realized the folly of his attempt to keep Chaise and I apart.  He wished me luck, and a speedy return, leaving before I could reply.  
	All of Griffins Bluff was a sea of emotion today-proud to serve our kyn in battle, sad that we were leaving, yet content knowing that victory would be swift and sure.  Those who were too young to serve (and some that were too old), marched in a makeshift regiment of their own, following behind us as we strode out of town.  These "troops" rallied behind their young leader, Sturnan Ironjaw.  His fertile imagination and sense of humor undoubtedly was the birthplace of such a sendoff.  I nearly broke step when I saw Chaise and her father standing together at the head of the line of well-wishers.  It seemed they had made peace with each other, and I'm certain I'll see her again.

Entry eighteen:

Today, I learned more about the army that we will be facing.  They are San Elves and are led by a fellow named Cotiaglo, a powerful Rune Mage.  This information is greatly disturbing to me.  I have never seen a San Elf, much less a San Elf Rune Mage.  I can fight a man with a weapon, but magick is an enigma to me.

Entry nineteen:

After a long hard march, we arrived at the mines of the Grand Duke.  The Grand Duke's forces are camped in a huge caven deep in the mines of the Grand Duke.  Never have I seen such beauty as I have seen in these mines.  When we first entered the mines, I definitely felt some culture shock, for though I have lived all my life on farms and never spent long periods of time underground.  There were several times during the first few days that I longed for fresh air and sunlight.  I have always wondered how other Hithuals can spend their whole lived underground.

However, after seeing the mines of the Grand Duke, I have a new appreciation for underground life.  These mines are not bare and damp holes in the ground.  As my eyes became more accustomed to the near total darkness, I began to fully access my Hithual night sight and truly see the "colors of the night."  There are subtle color and texture variations to the underground rocks that can only be perceived with Hithual night sight in near total darkness.  In fact, a sheet of bedrock that appears dull and gray by the harsh light of a torch may actually be a rainbow of color and ripples when viewed with our night sight.

The mines are actually a series of connecting cities and towns, with everything one would expect to find in a city or town above ground.  Houses, taverns, shops and other buildings have been carved into the mountains of the Great Divide.  Also long "roads" (or long tunnels if you prefer) have been carved between the cities and towns.  I have been told that there are tunnel-roads that connect the Grand Duke's mines to those of other Hithual nobility, and even to the lairs of other races.

Of course nothing that I had seen could prepare me for the capital of the Grand Duchy, Mineut (shortened from the original name, Miner's Utopia).  The city is larger than any that I have seen and I could not imagine a more beautiful place.  I have been told that the natural caverns were discovered by the Grand Duke's great-grandfather and provided the riches that eventually propelled the Stoneshoulders family to its current prominence.  For two generations the Stoneshoulders family mined this area and reaped more wealth than I can even imagine.  As their mining operations expanded, they hired more and more Hithuals to work in the mines.  Over time a cities developed around the mines.

These cities required goods that could not be provided in the Grand Duke's mines.  Gold and silver are pretty, but much too soft to use for pick-axes and other implements.  Furthermore, the workers needed to eat.  This led the Grand Duke to accept other Hithual lords and ladies as vassals and stimulated trade in the entire region.
  
Eventually, the Grand Duke's father decreed that the city of Minut could be mined no further.  The city would be the gleaming jewel of the Grand Duchey and would serve as the administrative and governmental center of his lands.  Thus great deposits of mineral wealth remain in the walls of the city.  Even now, one need only glance at the walls and ceiling to see the rich veins of gold, silver, and diamonds.  It is no wonder that Minut is known as the city that sparkles.

As I stated before, the forces were camped in a large cavern on the outskirts of Minut.  The cavern is known as "the fields," because it is used for the huge Hithball tournaments that occurr each year.  Teams from throughout the Grand Duchy will come to Minut to compete in the tournaments.  I am told that there are even leagues of teams that travel throughout the mines and surrounding lands.  Unfortunately, all organized Hithball leagues and tournaments have been canceled until the end of the campaign.

There are a ten full-sized Hithball fields in this cavern.  A soft, spongy moss has been cultivated to cover the fields (stone fields lead to injuries that are costly to professional teams).  Bleachers are carved into the walls to allow spectators a place to sit and watch.  Additionally, there are stalls and tents that serve to house vendors during the games and other buildings, stalls and tents that serve as dressing rooms for the teams.  All of the structures have commandeered by the various generals and other officers.

I have not noticed a lot of organization in the camp.  There is a lot of confusion, and it seems to be more of a party than a war camp.  It is commonly believed that the war is a foregone conclusion.  Although the San Elf forces are larger, our leaders know the mines better, and we have better access to supplies.  We can harass them and keep them generally lost.  Eventually, we will starve them out.

Entry twenty:

Today was incredible.  As I was sitting by myself and cleaning my axe, a general walked by.  He was a short and stalking fellow with a patch over one eye, and his name was Runtum Stonebrow.  It was generally known that he was the most hardened warrior in the camp (and the meanest).  He also was known for his brilliant battle strategies in the border skirmishes with the San Elves.

I watched the general walk by and noticed something out of the corner of my eye.   A San Elf had snuck into our camp and hidden himself in the shadows to await an opportunity to carry out mischief.  He was aiming a crossbow at General Runtum.

I screamed out a warning and threw a rock at the San Elf, spoiling his aim.  He managed to fire but missed.  Before, he could reload, the General was upon him and killed him with a few quick slices of his blade.

"Thankee fer the warnin', boy," said General Runtum, "I could surely use a stout lad like yerself in muh elite guard.  From now on, you will serve as muh personal aide and I will promote you to corporal."

Thus, I got a new job.

Entry twenty-one:

Boy, little did I realize what I was getting myself into.  While the other generals are mostly lazy nobility and let their companies loaf around and drink ale, General Runtum runs a tight ship.  I have been assigned to an infantry squad and serve under a young man named Sergeant Scurlinut.  Despite his relative youth, he is a battle-hardened veteran, having distinguished himself in the border skirmishes.

We devote ten hours a day to intensive training, such a close order drills.  Additionally, Sergeant Scurlinut has decided that I need additional work with a my blade, so he requires me to spar with him for a few hours before and after training.  Finally, I am required to fulfill my duties as an aide to the general before I go to bed and when I first awake.  This includes fetching the general's dinner and breakfast, cleaning his armor, weapons and uniform, keeping his quarters neat and running any other errand he can think of.  Needless to say, I am exhausted.

Entry twenty-two:

I can barely write this due to grief.  Today we received a terrible message.  At midday, a huge Hithual appeared in haze of shimmering lights.  He was caked with blood and ash and grime and looked tired.

"Damn, I doth hope to ne'er allow Flintor to translocate me again," he said.

"Brother Moram, what brings you here today?" asked my general.

"I doth bring grave news . . . grave news indeed," said Brother Moram, "but it is for your ears and the ears of the Grand Duke alone."

Said my general, "Masher, run to the Grand Duke's quarters and ask him to meet Brother Moram and I at muh quarters.  Make sure that you mention Brother Moram and say that it is urgent.  Then fetch food and ale for Moram and bring them to us."

I quickly delivered the message to the Grand Duke's aid and fetched the food and ale.  Surprisingly, by the time I arrived at General Runtum's quarters, the Grand Duke was already arriving.  That was when I fully grasped the importance of our visitor.  As I poured the ale, Brother Moram began to relay his message.

"There be no way to sayeth this gently.  The villages of the Bread Basket Earl hath been burned to the ground.  Thine food stores doth no longer exist and most of thine villagers are dead.  I didst come from a village called Griffins Bluff and hath witnessed the carnage personally," said Brother Moram.

At the mention of Griffins Bluff, I panicked and dropped the ale tankard, shattering it on the ground.

"Be more careful, you oaf," said the Grand Duke.

"Now give the boy some slack, Stoneshoulders," said my general, much to my surprise, "He is from Griffins Bluff."

"I be sorry, boy," said Brother Moram, "there be a few survivors but I hath no names save Sturnan Ironjaw."

"This is terrible news.  All those people dead . . . and the grain and other food.  We cannae starve the Sans out now.  It's certain.  We will have to engage them directly for a quick resolution, or we will starve.  Well, Stoneshoulders, I guess it is time to tighten the reigns on yer generals and get yer armies ready to fight.  You should have listened to me from the start," said General Runtum, and then said to me, "Go tell yer sergeant that I am sending yer squad to Griffins Bluff to check on the damage."

Thus, we leave tonight for Griffins Bluff.

Entry twenty-three:

The black ash that coated the forest did little to prepare us for what we saw when we broke through the trees.  Our hearts and steps quickened as we approached what little remained of Griffins Bluff.  Nary a building stood, the grain fields barns and homes all burned.  What few survivors remained were being tended to by some Brothers of The Order of Saint Gregarr, an Odarian order nearby.  The efforts at tending to the wounded were being coordinated by a hand cleric named Brother Flintor.

Chaise was not among the survivors, and Brother Flintor confirmed that she had not been taken to their temple to convalesce.  My shred of hope that she had somehow escaped the attack was dashed as I found her amulet, my grandmother's amulet, among the ruins of her home.  I ran into the woods and cried and tore at my clothes and beat on trees and rocks until I collapsed in a bloody heap.

Eventually, I stood and made my way to the stream where we used to meet and made a vow to her memory.  I will not rest until she is avenged.  The army of Cotiaglo will be wiped from the face of this earth or I will perish.  There is no longer any middle ground.

Sagely Wonderings
By Weldoian Sesca-Oskaloq


"Onlig!  Take the wheel!" cried Triam, over the noise of the storm.

The ship had been caughten in a huge storm, with hurricane winds, hail, and lightning.  It held up pretty well . . . for 5 hours so far, but the storm seemed to have plenty of power left.

"Got it!" Onlig said, grabbing the wheel as lightning struck down and touched the ocean, dissipating.

Triam looked over the bow and prayed to Odarous that he and Onlig would be saved.  He then heard the mast fall down and quickly went to move out of the way.

"Now what?" yelled Onlig.

"Improvise!  I'll be right back!" yelled Triam.  he knew the ship didn't stand a chance, so he headed for the lower deck
.
"What!?" yelled Onlig, as he watched Triam run down below.

What is he doing, wondered Onlig.  Onlig looked up at the sky and sighed.  He knew he'd die in this storm, and prayed to Sa that he would die honorably.  He dreamt of an island full of female Khats and gold and thousands of wars to be fought.  He was enveloped by his own dreams until someone in the distance kept shout: "Onlig!  Onlig!!"

Onlig came back to reality, and looked at Triam questionably.

"Tie this piece of wood to you neck!" yelled Triam, throwing a piece of rope and rope towards Onlig.

Onlig tied the piece of wood to his neck and grabbed the wheel tight.

Triam, followine his own instructions, waited for the storm to do the inevitable.  All seemed to be in slow motion now.  He saw the lightning form in the sky and come down towards the ship.  He watched Onlig look at it with the knowledge of death within his eyes.  He watched the lightning strike the ship, going through it towards the sea, and catching the wood of the ship a blaze.  He watched the shock and sound waves blast in all directions towards him and Onlig.  He felt the impact and was lifted off his feet.  He soared unnaturally through the air about 20 feet and then began to fall downwards.  He saw Onlig fall into the sea, it's cold wispy mouth swallowing him whole. 
 
Triam looked down towards the sea to which he fell, and hoped that his plan would work.  He sank into the cold depths of the sea and watched the water's edge rise further away from him.  He held his breath as much as he could, giving his best effort to stay alive, even though he knew his life was going to slip away.  His fall started to slow, and he began rising.  He watched the edge of the water sink slowly towards him . . . too slowly.  His lungs and brain revolted against him, making him gasp for a breath that wasn't there.  His own life-saving reflex would be the one to cause his death.  He tried to keep consciousness long enough to reach the top, and just as his head broke through the rim of the ocean, he blacked out, but not before seeing Onlig, unconscious, floating on the wood tied to his neck.  Triam's plan had saved them both.

******

Onlig came to slowly, and looked into the sky.  He felt cold and numb.  He thanked the numbness of his body, for he couldn't feel the pain that would be underneath.  he strained to move his head, but even through the numb, he felt a rush of pain.  He stopped and looked into the sky.  He tried to move his lungs, to control it back to it's normal vreathing rate, but that too was met with pain.  A pain so intense, he was knocked unconscious again.

******

Triam opened his eyes slightly.  He looked towards the sky but his eyes were meant with a straw roof.  He slowly turned his head, getting a brief look of the room in which he was in.  It was a small straw hut, from what he could tell, and he was lying, bundled in blankets, on the floor.  He knew he had been saved, obviously, but who saved him?  And what happened to Onlig?  He passed out again as approaching feet came upon him.

******

"Hey Father?" asked a young Frontacian girl.

"Yes dear?" asked an elderly Frontacian.

"Who did you save at the beach?" asked the girl.

"An Anthian and a Leuian, dear.  Probably from the Spur." answered the elder.	

"Oh.  Is the Spur that city you left?" asked the girl.

"It is." said the elder.

"Oh," said the girl, "I'm gonna go check on the Anthian guy, okay?" asked the girl.

"You do that while I check on the Leuian." said the Elder, getting up from his chair and walking away. 
 
The Frontacian girl ran towards her room, where the Anthian was held.  She saw his face lean to one side as she approached and calmly knelt beside him.  She raised her hand, calling forth a waking rune.  She let it power up and then released it on the Anthian.

"Ughn . . . hrm?" groaned the Anthian.

"Hiya!" said the girl.

"Uhm . . . hello.  Where . . . am I?" asked the Anthian.
	
"You're in my room!  Me and my dad has been taking care of you.  We found you on the beach knocked out two days ago." said the girl.

"Two days?  Ughn . . . " said the Anthian, slipping back to unconsciousness.

"Oh no you don't!" giggled the girl, calling forth several healing runes, and then releasing them on the Anthian.  The Anthian came back and began sitting up.

"Ugghn!!!" the Anthian cried out in pain.

"It'll be okay!  The pain will subside." said the girl assuringly.

"Thanks.  What's your name?" said the Anthian.

"My name is Aristhma!  Nice to meet you." said the girl.

"Nice to meet you.  I'm Triam." said the Anthian.

"Oh!  Did you come from the Spur?" asked Aristhma.

"I did." answered Triam.

"Cool!.  My dad left there years ago.  He said it was too violent for him or something like that." said Aristhma.

"Oh.  Well . . . it isn't that violent anymore." said Triam.

"Hrm . . . maybe we could go back there someday.  I'd love to see it!" exclaimed Aristhma.

Triam grinned.

"By the way . . . " began Triam.

"DEMON!!!  FOUL CREATURE!!!!  SPAWN!!!" yelled the now furious Elder.

"What is it Father?" asked Aristhma, turning towards the Elder in the doorway.

"These creatures are spawns of Nalnoia!!!" yelled the Elder.

"Who's that?" asked Aristhma.

The Elder Frontacian charged towards Triam, grabbing him by the shoulders.
  
"Come to harm my daughter and me, have you?" demanded the Elder.

"Father, please!" plead Aristhma.

"Stay out of this Aristhma!" yelled the Elder.

"Nalnoia?  I don't understand." said Triam.

"Shut up, scum!" the Elder growled.

The Elder hit Triam in the head with his massive head, sending Triam back into unconsciousness.  He grabbed Triam and put him over his shoulder.  He turned around and headed for the door.
	
"Father!  What're you doing with them?" asked Aristhma.

"To the Cliffs of Chill!" said the Elder.

"Oh no!  But they'll die!!!" cried Aristhma.

"Fine with me!  They'll return to the place that spawned them!" yelled the Elder.

******

Onlig woke up and looked around the room.  He was in a rocky chamber, with a rock sticking his back.  Triam lay unconscious across the room.  The entrance was barred, much like a jail cell.  The air was freezing, his body numb.  He sighed.  No death today.  Or would there.  He heard a wave crash into the rock face below, and watched the wave rushed towards him and Triam.  The force of the wave crashed into him, sending him back into unconsciousness.  He knew that he would die here . . . .and in a dishonorable way.

The Barbaric Forgefist
By Meqetlh Forgefist 

This be the unusual story of the only Forgefist clanner to e'er be a barbarian.  It is also a tale of a brother found, that was once thought lost fore'er.  I be no bard, only a simple fighter, but I shall do my best to relate to ye the tale.  It begins back in the Great Divide, over seventy years ago.


Clan Forgefist

Clan Forgefist be one of many Hithual clans that be spread throughout the Great Divide.  The clanhome for Clan Forgefist lay on the far side of the Great Divide from Spur, near the Great Wastes.  Historically, Clan Forgefist has been a clan of fighters and weapon smiths.  Almost e'eryone in the clan follows Odarous, with maybe only one or two exceptions a generation.  Bein' a clan of fighters that follow Odarous, we have been known to make enemies o'er the years.

The clanhome is a stronghold, carved out of solid rock deep underground.  Only one tunnel leads to the surface, protected by thick bluesteel doors.  Other tunnels connect to nearby clans, or to the ancient Hithuals tunnels that run deep beneath the Great Divide.  Many battles had been fought there o'er the ages, but Clan Forgefist had ne'er fallen.  Carvings and murals throughout the clanhome record the battles of long ago.  Many other works are dedicated Odarous, includin' the giant statue of the Odarian Eagle that dominates one end of the Great Hall.  Only a mural or two were dedicated to the only other gods that Forgefist clanners had e'er followed in the past, Rinanni, Unknown, and Elindale.

In the clan, there be a mighty fighter by the name of RaTond Forgefist.  He married a lass named Niassi, and together they had four children, three sons named Battelth, Meqetlh, and Cutlich, and a daughter named Alemethia.  Battelth was born first, early in the year, and I was born second, late in the same year.  Fifteen years after, Cutlich was born.  Alemethia was born seven years after that.

One night, long ago, when I was about twenty, the clan was attacked by a strong band of Sanene warriors.  They struck from the ancient tunnels that crisscross the Great Divide, and caught the clan unaware.  The San Elves breached the defenses of Clan Forgefist, when most of us were sleeping.  Forgefist clanners are no strangers to battle, and even though many were struck down before they could arm themselves, soon a strong defense was formed against the intruders.  The Hithuals, RaTond being one of them, forced out the Sans.

During the course of the attack, a five year old Cutlich was one of many Hithuals slain.  I suppose out of fear, Cutlich departed.  There be several Odarian priests in Clan Forgefist, and they rezzed most of the other fallen Hithuals.  Others that had departed, soon were returned to the small alter to Odarous that be located in the clanhome.  However, Cutlich did not return.  He had died too young to have been dedicated to any of the gods.  All of us thought that young Cutlich had died the final death, and we mourned the loss of the child Hithual, too young to have learn the ways of combat, and most sad, even too young to have tasted ale.


Megrunt Blunderknot

What was not know to us at the time, is that young Cutlich was brought to an alter of Unknown, located far from Clan Forgefist in a remote part of the Great Divide.  Why Unknown did this is still a mystery, and most likely always will be.  Perhaps Unknown has some purpose for the Hithual, but who can say?  It would seem for whatever reason Unknown had put a claim on Cutlich at a very young age.

Meditating at the alter of Unknown at the time of Cutlich's arrival was a mountain of a Thugian.  His name was Megrunt Blunderknot.  He was not only a follower of Unknown, but a barbaric shaman as well.  He lived in a cave not far from where this alter was located.

Megrunt began to raise the young Hithual as his own son.  Again, it is not clear why he did this.  Mayhaps he tried to locate the family of the Hithual, but being too far away from the Forgefist clanhome, was unable to find them.  Mayhaps he felt that Unknown wanted him to raise the lad.  It is even possible that Unknown spoke to Megrunt, and told him to raise the boy.  Again, we probably ne'er know the reason for sure.

Now Cutlich knew not Common at that young age, and Megrunt knew not Hithual, so Megrunt was unable to even learn the lad's name.  So Megrunt named him Xxerox, and he came to be known as Xxerox Blunderknot.  Before too long, Xxerox learned Common from Megrunt, and Xxerox came to consider the huge Thugian as his father.  Time and trauma served to bury any memories of his life as a Forgefist clanner.

Either Megrunt learned that Hithuals do not eat raw meat, or quickly learned that fact, for he would always cook Xxerox's meals for him.  Sometimes the Thugian would join the Hithual for the cooked meal, but usually he would eat something else uncooked.  Xxerox grew up thinking this and other barbaric practices that Megrunt did as rather normal, even if'n he did not always partake of them himself.

Megrunt learned how to make beef jerky, and young Xxerox found that he loved the taste of it.  Megrunt would spend many hours a week making beef jerky for the Hithual over the next several years, and to this day Xxerox be known for his love of beef jerky.


The Thugian father would also spend many hours a week trying to teach his young Hithual son the ways of Unknown, and teach him about the spirits the shaman would communicate with.  He also would show him the workings of his shamic magick.  Xxerox almost ne'er really listened, howe'er, for at this young age he could care less about the gods, spirits, or magick.

Xxerox was much more interested in learning the ways of combat, and the secrets of berserk.  After watching the raw power Megrunt unleashed on a mountain bear the first time Xxerox had witnessed a berserking barbarian, he knew he wanted to be a barbarian when he grew up.  He would almost constantly push the Thugian to teach him more about the ways of a barbarian.  Megrunt proved to be as able a teacher as Xxerox was eager a student on that subject.

At the age of ten came a day that Xxerox would ne'er forget, and one that would fore'er change his life.  After spending several hours teasing wolverines, Xxerox returned to the Blunderknot cave.  As usual, small pots of strange weed was burning, filling the air with its sweet smells.  Megrunt gestured to his son to come to him.

He said, "Xxerox, me son, me big things speak to ye.  I speak spirits of me ancestors.  Spirits tell me soon I go them.  Soon me gone."

Xxerox's first reactions was a hostile one.  Askin' why and cursing the spirits, he told Megrunt not to go, but to stay with him.

"Me no choice, Xxerox.  Me time soon," the Thugian told his angry and despairing son.  "Ye hearty boy, but young.  When me go, ye need family."

"But me want no family, me want you!" pleaded the boy.

Grabbing the Hithual's shoulder and staring deeply into his eyes, the large barbarian said, "Ye listen me.  Ye do me say.  Ye trust me.  One day, ye understand.  No argue me, we go."

Xxerox knew Megrunt well enough to know that there be no argument possible, and he sadly resigned himself to his fate.  Megrunt knew of a Hithual healer that lived a short journey from their cave, and he took Xxerox there.  A few days later, word reached the household of the death of Megrunt.  Xxerox wept bitterly for many days after that, and cursed the gods and spirits and whatever else he could think of, that took away his beloved father.


House Rainbows

The home that Megrunt took the angry young Hithual was House Rainbows.  It was a small home carved out of the mountainside on the road to the village of Griffin Bluff.  Living there were two Hithual Rinannian clerics, Dokhan Rainbows and his wife, Kari.  They also had a young son, Myler, who was two years older than Xxerox.  The walls of House Rainbows where covered in bookcases, stuffed full of old books and scrolls.  Any bare spot on a wall either had a painting of Rinanni, or Rinannian scriptures engraved on them.

Dokhan and Kari were loving people, and were as happy to take Xxerox in as Xxerox was unhappy to be there.  Here was a wild and hurting soul, they told themselves, desperate for the peace and love of Rinanni.

The Rainbows family was not wealthy, by any means.  But there was always an ample, if simple meal on the table for dinner.  Ale was drunk sparingly by the Rainbows', if'n ye can believe it, usually reserved for special occasions or for the visitors that frequented the healers.

The transition of Xxerox living with the Rainbows' was not easy, either for the barbaric child, or for the Rinannians.  At first, Xxerox would hardly eat, speak, or even look at his new family.  He refused to bathe, after all, he ne'er had to when he lived with Megrunt.  He would not play with Myler, and beat up the older lad several times.

Over time, the soothing words of Dokhan and Kari slowly began to wear down Xxerox's hostility.  Then one night, either in a dream or in a vision, Xxerox saw the spirit of Megrunt watching him, and looking at him disapprovingly.  Waking with a start, the lad resolved to make the best of his situation, and to give family Rainbows a chance.

This of course, made things much easier for Dokhan and Kari, but things were still far from ideal.  They had an uneducated, wild, and highly, highly active young boy on their hands.  He constantly ran through the home, knocking over books, scroll, ink wells, and anything else loose.  Young Xxerox loved to scream at the top of his lungs, flailing his arms, pretending to berserk against unseen foes.  He often would leap out and try to tackle his new family.  House Rainbows was no longer the peaceful home it once was.  The clerics were real credits to their faith, howe'er, and they ne'er struck the lad, or where hostile with him.

The clerics tried to educate the lad, but were constantly frustrated by his short attention span.  The only things Xxerox wanted to learn about were the ways of battle, and that was something Dokhan and Kari could not and would not teach him.  Eventually, they did set into a routine where Xxerox spend one hour a day learning to improve his Hithual language skills in the morning, and one hour a day improving his Common language skills.  Later on, when Xxerox discovered the wondrous flavor of fine Hithual ale, he would get a small cup of ale as a reward for attentive work, and he made good progress.

Over the years Xxerox did come to consider House Rainbows his home.  He ne'er was willing to be counted as a Rainbows himself, howe'er, and counted them his stepfamily.  In his heart he still was a Blunderknot.  And he did mellow over the years as well, and while he ne'er became the peaceful Rinannian his stepparents wished him to be, he did learn to wear a veneer of civilization while indoors.

When Myler reached the Age of Dedication, he naturally selected to serve Rinanni and left for the Rinanni Temple in the Great Citadel, to become an acolyte.  Myler had studied and trained for it his whole young life, after all.  Xxerox had not really paid the gods much thought until then, but realized that soon it would be his turn to dedicate to one of the gods, if he so wished.  All he knew for use is that he would not dedicate to peace-loving Rinanni, whom Xxerox secretly considered to be the sissy-girl goddess.

House Rainbows always seemed to have a steady stream of visitors, as a healers home be a popular stop for road-weary travelers.  Whene'er a priest or priestess of one of the gods stopped to visit, Xxerox would spend time with them, asking questions.  Xxerox soon learned that only three of the gods accepted barbarians as worshipers, and Xxerox was as determined as e'er to become a barbarian.  His choices were down to Odarous, Unknown, and Taath.  As he would speak to clerics of the three gods, old forgotten lessons of Megrunt's would resurface in his mind, lessons on the need for balance in nature, and in the spirit realms.  When Xxerox reached his Day of Dedication, he selected to follow Unknown.

The time had come for Xxerox to take up a profession.  He had learned of a barbarians guild located to the south, in the merchant city known as Spur.  He was surprised at how sad he felt leaving House Rainbows.  Dokhan and Kari had become more family to him that he wanted to admit, but he was anxious for his dream of becoming a barbarian to become true.  He left for Spur, his backpack full of beef jerky and ale.


The Spur

It did not take long for Xxerox to get indoctrinated into the Barbarians Guild of Spur.  There he studied, trained, and practiced diligently.  The first time he beserked was mayhaps the happiest moment in the young man's life.  He had done it, he was finally, truly, a barbarian!

The mightiest barbarian in Spur be Smakem Buckhanna.  Mayhaps reminding Xxerox some of Megrunt, Xxerox looked up to Smakem a great deal, as a father figure.  Smakem came to be a mentor to Xxerox, and o'er the years Xxerox came to be a mighty barbarian in his own right under Smakem's masterful tutelage.

Xerox did learn that the ability to berserk had some serious drawbacks.  He became somewhat disillusioned with it o'er time, but still enjoyed the life of a barbarian and continued to struggle to better learn to control his berserkin' abilities.

The Hithual barbarian took a cougar for a pet, purchased at a merchant festival.  He named the cougar Max.  Max would go on hunts with his master, loyally defending him in battle.  Soon Max learned to love eatin' beef jerky too, just like his master.  Max still prefers milk o'er ale, howe'er.

Xxerox also joined the Colinth Argonix of Spur, an organization of Hithuals dedicated to helping newcomer Hithuals to Spur, preserving Hithual history and customs in face of the cosmopolitan nature of Spur, and providing Hithual fellowship.  I came to know Xxerox through the Colinth Argonix.  We were not particularly close friends during those early years, as'n we had yet to learn that we be related.

O'er the course of time, I came to be the Colinth-tek, or leader of the Colinth Argonix.  While I had been Colinth-tek, Kraggon Rockhard, who had been Spur's first Colinth-tek, served the Colinth Argonix as one of the Magresh-teks, or Huntmasters.  Kraggon felt the need to step down from the position, as'n he not the time to hold many hunts.  He recommended Xxerox for the office.  The membership of the Colinth Argonix voted Xxerox in as the newest Magresh-tek!  Xxerox spoke to the membership about the need for a treasurer to handle the collection of funds, and givin' out of said funds to newly arrived Hithuals that be in need.  Xxerox was then also voted as the actin' treasure of the Colinth Argonix!

A few months later, it was time for the elections of the officers of the Colinth Argonix.  I had decided not to run for the position of Colinth-tek again.  I began speakin' to several Hithuals that I thought would make a good Colinth-tek about runnin' for the office.  Because of all the fine work Xxerox had done as Magresh-tek, Xxerox was one of the Hithuals I asked to run.  At first he did not want to, but was later persuaded to run by Rev Lastcall, the Progtah, or Revered One of the Colinth Argonix.  Xxerox ended up bein' elected the new Colinth-tek of the Colinth Argonix!  And thus far he has done a great job leadin' the Hithuals of Spur, havin' being faced with and nicely dealt with several difficult issues.

In the following months, Xxerox and myself started spending a lot of time together.  We often times would hunt or train together.  A strong bond of friendship began to form between us.  And still we knew not that we be related to each other.


The Discovery

Recently, my girlfriend Kalistyn Zalane and I decided to travel back to the Great Divide, to the Forgefist clanhome.  I wanted my family to meet her, particularly my father, RaTond.  I knew he did not approve of her, as'n she be a godless psion.  I knew Kalistyn to be a lovely and kindly hearted Hithual, and I thought that if'n he met the lass, he'd be more willin' to give her a chance.

We were outside the bank in Market Circle, havin' just purchased some supplies from the general store, when Xxerox entered from the archway to Market Street.  Learnin' of our travel plans, he asked if'n he could travel with us, to keep us company and out of trouble.  He also said he'd like to see an actual Hithual clanhome, ne'er, to his recollection, havin' been to one.  We agreed.

The journey to Clan Forgefist was long, but not too eventful.  The three of us and Max the cougar were able to handle any trouble we met during the trip.  We reached the Forgefist clanhome via the ancient Hithual tunnels beneath the Great Divide.

We met my sister, Alemethia, in the Great Hall.  She told us that Battelth was away at the Great Citadel at the moment.  She also said that RaTond was at the forge in his livin' quarters, makin' crossbow bolts.  We followed her through the passageways that lead to RaTond's forge.

Seein' us enter, my father shut down the forge, and put away his forging gear.  He gave me a hearty welcome, glad to see me so soon after my last visit, as'n I don't tend to return to the clanhome often.  He greeted Kalistyn politely, if'n a wee bit coolly.  As he greeted Xxerox, his had a strange look on his face.

Father asked, "Have we met before, noble Xxerox?  There be somethin' about ye that seems familiar, although I can't recall e'er meetin' ye."

"Nay, good sir, we have never met," answered Xxerox.

"Hmmm… mayhaps ye just remind me of another," said RaTond, as he scratched his full warriors beard.  He shrugged it off, and began showin' his guests around his quarters.

As father was showin' the master bedroom, my mother walked in.  Seein' me, Niassi ran o'er to me and gave me a big hug.  Then, lookin' at Xxerox, her face betrayed shock, and she yelled out, "Cutlich!"

RaTond whipped his head around, starin' hard at the surprised barbarian.  His jaw dropped and he said, "Indeed, it be our son, Cutlich!"  Both Niassi and RaTond embraced their newfound, if'n startled, son.  Kalistyn, Alemethia, and I watched with confusion.

"How can Xxerox be Cutlich?" I asked.  "Cutlich died when he was only five years old."

Niassi said, "I don't yet understand how, but this be Cutlich!  A mother knows her son!"

Xxerox thought, was it possible?  Could this be my parents, my family from before Megrunt?  Mayhaps he just looked a lot like this Cutlich.  He struggled to remember.  Then somethin' caught his attention from the corner of his eye.  Sittin' on a self was a small, yellow, stuffed yelican toy.  Xxerox picked it up, lookin' at it curiously.  Turnin' to Niassi, he asked, "Yammy?"

"Aye!" exclaimed his mother.  "That was yer favorite toy as a lad!  Ye called him Yammy!"  She grabbed and hugged her youngest son again, overcome with joy.  At last, Cutlich was returned to her!

We set down, and my parents told the story of how Cutlich was thought lost.  They also told different childhood stories, trying to spark some memories in Cutlich.  Mostly my barbarian brother was not able to remember anything, but occasionally something would spark a faint memory or two.  Cutlich told of his being found by Megrunt at Unknown's alter, and his raising by the Thugian and the Rainbows' family.  The truth was finally known!

I spent most of this time mightily confused.  'Twas hard to think of my friend Xxerox, whom I'd known for years, as my brother Cutlich.  Eventually my simple mind was finally able to come to terms with it, and now I be very happy to have another brother!

The celebration that the clan threw was second to none.  Ale flowed that night as water flows o'er a raging waterfall!  My father was too happy at findin' his lost son to be upset at Kalistyn for being godless.  A good time was had by all!

All too soon, it was time to return to Spur.  So I set out, with the lovely Kalistyn Zalane, Max the silver-collared cougar, and my barbaric brother, Cutlich Forgefist!

Kelwop
Researched by Blister Peddlersklan


Kelwop:  Kelwop is a rock-like mineral found in underground damp areas.  It was first discovered by Kelwop Befuddled when he led the digging to a new subterranean city.

Kelwop is rather rare, but when found is very plentiful.  Kelwop maintains a very lightweight matter which is from the constant dripping of water in certain caverns over hundreds of years.  This creates micro holes small enough to keep its form but reduce the weight.  It is still a strong material.  It also maintains a very polished texture and a strange glowing aura which no one has been able to explain yet.

Kelwop has been used for a variety of purposes by Flerians in the past.  Its very common for them to chip or carve almost any house hold item out of them. Mugs, silverware, platter, weapons, tools.  Some Usils believe the Kelwop mineral is responsible for the strange glowing aura which comes from many of the Flerian's inventory.  They even believe exposure to this mineral has given them their night vision.

One Flerian fashion designer long ago used this mineral as a fashion statement when she had it hammered into small dust and sprinkled upon a Noble Lady's gown.  She was quite popular until she ran into an accident with a Dragon's maw.  Kelwop was also a popular weapon made into a long lance for a Flerian who somehow got knighted.  However, on his first joust (In a Noble Knight's game), the Flerian was lynched for lifting the other jouster's purse with the lance.

Let The Curious Beware
By Cutter Strongblade


I sat alone by the fire, feeling snug as I listened to the swish and spatter of the rain outside.  Anyone outside in the storm must have been miserable, but not terrified.

Terrified was what the Elf was.  My door burst open as the little man staggered inside.  I twisted in my chair to see who had entered.  He jumped as he saw me, but his expression did not change; it was of blind, maddened fear.  As I looked him over, I was reminded of a frightened mouse.  He was a small, thin Usil Elf and his tired-looking face was pale with terror.  He wore no hat, and his hair was sleek with rain.  For a long moment, neither of us spoke.  He was gasping, apparently from running.  

Finally, he panted, "I beg your pardon . . . I . . . may . . . may I stay here awhile?"  He then staggered to a chair and collapsed into it.  I scowled as I watched his wet clothes soak into the chair.  He looked up at me timidly.  "I know this must seem strange," he gasped.  "But I . . . I got caught in the storm, you see."

"What are you doing out on such a night Elf?"  I asked after awhile.  His gasps slowly quieted.  I stood up from my chair.  "Well, go ahead.  What's your story?"  He gulped as his gaze fell to the ground, regarding the floorboards for awhile in silence.  Then he quivered, and looked sharply around.  "Go ahead," I repeated.

He licked his lips and brushed the damp hair from his forehead and told me his story:

"All this will seem incredible sir, but I swear it is nothing but the truth.  I'm just a appraiser for a trading post in town, and I live by myself a couple of miles from here.  I've never been in any kind of trouble before this . . . "

I thought it over and urged him to continue.

"Well, I'd been living here uneventfully for almost two years.  Then something happened that upset my entire existence.  One evening I was returning home from town and I was pretty deep in thought about one thing or another and lost my way.  The woods were unfamiliar, one of the few places I had not explored.  It was a nice night and decided to put it to use.  I strolled along rather slowly, giving my surroundings a leisurely examination.  As I walked, dusk fell, and the moon illuminated the way.  The semi-darkness gave the surroundings somewhat of an . . . eerie look.  I wasn't really uneasy, you understand..I'm not a particularly imaginative man.  So it came as something of a shock when I spotted a thin line of yellow light in the distance.  As I approached, I could make out a dingy abandoned shack.  The thin line of light peeped through a crack in the boards over a tightly nailed-up window.  The building seemed dilapidated beyond repair.  I stopped in front of the window and gazed at it with a great deal of puzzlement.  The other windows were boarded so tight I couldn't tell whether there was light in any of the other rooms or not.  As I watched the light . . . the light BLINKED at me.  That is, it went dark for an instant, and then lit up again.  It occurred to me that such a thing might be caused by someone's walking in front of the window inside.  And it seemed odd."

"Now, as I say, I'm not an imaginative man . . . and not usually inquisitive either.  Still, that light and its blinking . . . it did it again . . . set me into thinking the matter over.  And it irritated me, because I couldn't quite understand it.  What would anyone be doing in a boarded-up old house, and at that hour?  Well, I felt I had to know the answer.  I grabbed the window-ledge with my finger-tips, and gave a little jump.  I couldn't hold myself up there, but as I bobbed by the crack, I caught a glimpse of the room within.  As I hit the ground again, I was trembling.  It wasn't the sort of room you'd expect in an abandoned shack.  Just with that fleeting glimpse, I'd received and distinct view of cleanness.  Not whiteness, but gleaming, polished black.  I'd never seen a room with shining black walls before . . . and it frightened me.  It seemed unnatural.  Moreover, I'd glimpsed a human figure as though it was garbed for a costume ball.  Scarlet with black figurings.  I stood in the moonlight, shivering, and thinking.  No explanation came to me, and I told myself there must be some ordinary, common-sense, reason.  In any case, I felt I had to know."

The man looked around him and gazed at the shaded windows.  Then, his gaze fell to the floor again, and he resumed his story.

"Well," he went on, "there was an old log nearby, and I rolled it under the window.  I stood it on end and climbed up for a good long look.  It was hard to see much through the crack, and to this day I can't be quite sure what I saw.  There seemed to be one person in the room, a man of unusual height, clothed . . . as I said earlier . . . in a crimson robe, with designs in black.  When I looked this second time, the man was kneeling in the center of the room, making very odd gestures.  A foot or so beyond the man, something I couldn't see was giving off weirdly multi-colored smoke.  The man seemed to be mumbling to himself, a faint drone which suggested no words in any language I'd ever heard.  The scene was so utterly bizarre, that I was fascinated, and stayed perched on the log . . . staring for dear life, and hoping I'd see something that would explain it all."

"How long I remained there staring I have no idea.  It must have been hours.  Very little seemed to happen, at least very little that was even remotely intelligible.  The gestures and faint mumbling went on for a long while, then ceased, and the smoke swirled as if a draft had entered the room.  At this point, I became aware that the red-robed man was not alone in the room as I had originally thought.  Another man, similarly robed but with black the dominating color, and red that of the designs stood in the room.  There was something strange in the posture and movements of this new figure.  They spoke from time to time, but always softly, and the syllables never formed into intelligible words.  Moreover, the more I watched, the less sure I was of the number of people in the room."

"Finally, I noticed that the mumbling was now accompanied by a semi-musical droning which rose and fell as though with the accents of the speech.  The single person I now saw stood silent, listening.  A shadow fell upon him.  My scalp prickled with a sense of approaching menace.  I shifted my weight uneasily on my aching legs.  The log creaked, sharply.  The man in the room turned his head and stared straight into my eyes."

The stranger paused again.  He glanced around once more, and moved restlessly in his chair.  "Go on!" I urged.  The man sighed and continued:

"There was no question he saw me . . . or, rather, saw my eyes at the crack.  His face writhed and moved swiftly . . . and so did I.  I dropped to the ground, terrified, and ran.  I was hardly away when, glancing back in fright, I saw the entire slab of boards burst off the window.  The man in the scarlet robe appeared in the window and shouted something hoarse and intelligible.  The light in the room went out as he spoke.  I darted through the forrest, found a familiar path, and ran all the way home.  I barred the door and remained standing for a long time, quivering in fear.  Finally I relaxed a bit and got up enough courage to go to bed.  I slept little that night.  Or since."

"For it didn't end there.  Rather, that was only the beginning.  The days were getting shorter as autumn came on, and it was dusk by the time I got home.  As I made my trip back from town each day, I would be followed all the way home.  Whoever followed did do at a distance, and in shadow, but after the first couple of nights the creature's purpose was plain enough.  I was being hunted.  Someone wanted to . . . to get me alone in the dark, where no one could see us, and . . . well, I prefer not to think.  It occurred to me before long to take a different route home.  At first the prowler, or prowlers, missed me on the new route, but after two nights of freedom, I saw someone dodge into the shadows as I turned to look."

"It was a vague, unnameable menace, but it was terrifying enough.  My mind was never easy, and I dreaded the end of each working day.  My work suffered, and I was spoken to rather harshly more than once, but how could I explain?  I was convinced, you see, that whatever it was I had seen, its perpetrators were resolved I should be removed of that knowledge, and were out to destroy me.  Moreover, I had no idea who . . . or what . . . they were, nor whether they lived in that old shack, nor whether they dwelt together or separately.  I wouldn't be likely to recognize them again, dressed in ordinary clothes.  I could only know them by their actions."

"Finally, they struck.  One night I tried new route, along a road with which I wasn't overly familiar.  To my alarm, the road led into a stretch of dark pine forrest.  Well, I feared the old route more than the woods, so I went ahead.  I was already dusk and terribly dark.  What a horrible few moments that was!  I went through slowly, feeling my way, breathing cautiously, and tensed for I didn't know what.  But I reached the other end of the forrest, and let out my breath in a sigh of relief . . . when something past which I had walked . . . struck at me from behind.  I had quickened my pace just as the blow fell, which must have been the reason only grazed the back of my head.  I reeled, momentarily blinded with shock and pain.  Then, quite automatically and without thought save pure terror, I recovered my balance and ran madly."

He whimpered softly and continued, "I have no memory of getting back to my house, my mind simply blacked out.  Once safely in my room, I examined the back of my head with the aid of two mirrors, and found my hair was lightly splashed with blood at the roots, from a series of parallel scratches.  They were only superficial, though, and had already stopped bleeding.  Still, I looked at the scratches for a long time.  My assailant must have used an extraordinary type of weapon.  That was last night."

"This morning I was afraid to leave my room, but the bright sun shining in my window dispelled my worst fears.  I went to work, but when it came time to go home, I was terrified to find the sky do overcast it was completely dark.  After a good deal of troubled thought, I decided to take my usual route home, since the walk was much shorter than the others.  I was about halfway home when the rain started.  I thought I saw something hiding behind a tree a few yards from me.  My fear was soon realized, as the dark shape stepped from behind the tree, one arm raised."

"I turned and ran, blindly, in the first direction that suggested itself.  A figure stepped into my path . . . friend or foe I never found out, for I dodged with panicky swiftness and ran in another direction.  I ran with hysterical speed, the rain driving hard into my face.  My hat flew off, and in confusion slowed for a instant . . . only to dash on faster than before when I heard the quick tread of pursuing feet close behind.  I twisted and turned, up one path and down another, splashing wildly into puddles, completely out of my mind with fear.  I ran for miles, all the pent-up terror of weeks let loose in one blind burst of energy.  It was like a nightmare.  I had no idea where or why I was going . . . only to escape my nameless pursuer.  I found myself on the east of town in a residential area.  Finally, I came to the idea of taking refuge in a house . . . any house . . . and I ran to this one."

He stopped, and looked at me.  "He . . . or they . . . may be lurking outside.  I don't dare to leave.  You MUST keep me here, at least until morning!  Don't you see my position?  Surely you'll help me!"

He looked very pathetic as he pleaded.  But, "I'm sorry," I said evenly, "but I'm afraid you've come to the wrong person.  It's hardly strange, of course, there are . . . quite a few of us."  I flexed my hands, unsheathing my claws.

He had time for just one short scream.
