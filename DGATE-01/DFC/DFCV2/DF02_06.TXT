Dear Readers,

We're back!  Apologies for the rather long delay between issues this month, but things have been hectic and some of our offices were recently destroyed.  Just ask Esper-somehow, according to him, his work space was ravaged by marauding orks, which is why he hasn't sent in any society columns this month.  I'll leave it up to you, dear readers, to decide if he's telling the truth...

Aside from that, we have a great issue for you all.  Rise of the Classes is back, and I can't wait to be lynched for publicly listing Spur's top 50 thieves (blame it on Fearagoh!).  The Anthians are giving a strong showing as always, with Rhea's continuing saga and another of Guztymne's works.  We also have a few first time contributors, and even the return of a long lost staff member (Frason).

And, yes, it IS harass the staff week.

Keep your harp strings dry,

Marigold Lyrian
Editor-In-Chief

Bronze 5 
By Rhea Romero

Inzy squinted carefully at the many colors of marks along the walls of the tunnel.  "Lord, you can barely read these," she groaned.  "I think the blue ones go to the right turnoff, but they MAY be green..."

Lobb frowned.  "Well, figure it out."

Inzy scratched the side of her neck.  "Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's blue.  Let's go this way."  She made off for the right turnoff.  Lobb paused to stare at the marks, and decided that they were pretty questionable.  He followed her anyway.

The crowds thinned out considerably when they turned.  The only other people there were a group of Go-blin-als who apparently were lost.  Inzy started to get nervous and instinctively pulled out her dagger.

The only danger they ran into, however, was another turnoff that led right to a small cart on a track spreading a good ways out in either direction.  Inzy and Lobb eyed it with distaste.

"So, we ride in that," said Lobb.

"I guess so," said Inzy.

There was a pause.  Lobb glanced backwards and Inzy scratched her neck again.

"Well," she said.  "Let's have a go at it, shall we?"  Lobb looked at her, and it was quite clear that he wasn't going to until she did.  Inzy moaned a little and moved towards the cart.  It was tiny and made of rusting steel, with an interior lined with moldy hemp.  It appeared to be propped up against two triangles beneath the front wheels.  Next to it was a wooden lever.  The tunnel it moved along lapsed into total darkness after one meter.  There were no seats inside.  Inzy had no idea how she would fit, along with Lobb, into a thing clearly designed for creatures half her size.  But she did, because her adventurer's spirit would not permit her to shirk it.  It was still disgusting.

Seeing Inzy safely crammed into the cart, Lobb had no choice but to follow.  Muttering beneath his breath, he jumped over the side and ended up sitting on Inzy's knees.  They glared at the lever.  "Well, pull it," Inzy said.  "You're closer."  He scowled at her and yanked it.  The wheel supports fell out and they rather shakily moved off.  It was slower than they expected for the first few seconds, but then they sloped downwards and got into the really nasty part.

His teeth rattling and his hands stiffly gripping the sides, Lobb yelled, "Where do we stop?"

"I think I'm going to be sick," Inzy yelled back.

And if that weren't bad enough, the next second their cart hit a pebble and jumped track.

Cherishing You
by Guztymne Horawytz

Dedicated to my love of 9 days, L.

"Come to me now, lay your hands over me.
Even if it's a lie, say it will be alright,
I shall believe....
Ain't not everything is gonna be the way you think it ought to be,
And everytime I try to make it right it all comes down on me,
Please say honestly you won't give up on me,
I shall believe."

He sat down on the sand.  The cold sea breeze swept through his light brown hair and softly drained his warmth.  I dropped my sandals beside him.  Taking off my cloak, I slipped it around his shoulders.  Then, I sat down beside his body, finding some sanctuary beside his bulk.  It was quite humorous that he was wearing so little- just a little tunic- while I walked with him in my conglomerate of fancy cloaks and coats.

"I am a cold-freak," I mumbled.  It was true.  The cold sea breeze was a foreigner to me, and to protect my inner soft body, I had to wear extra clothes, sometimes, bundled up beyond comedy.  He smiled.  He rested his head on my left shoulder, and I wondered if he would cut himself on my body shoulder.  I asked him.  He denied.  I reached out to touch his cheek, my lips touched his, and the stars dimmed into the background.

~~~

Honestly, it is hard to say how it all began.  I remember when I stepped into the tavern, and saw a bulk of a man sitting alone.  No one else had arrived yet, and he sat there- alone.  We greeted each other and introduced our strange beings and unfamiliar names.  I sat down.  He sat down.  I looked at him.  He glanced back.  I look away and reach for a local flyer of local events.  I glance at him.  He is still looking at me.

Fortunately, the rest of the gang came along, and we began chatting, mostly between him and the rest of the gang.  I was the silent listener, not a very good listener at that.  It intrigued me how his life was full of incidents and events, contrary to my dull life.  I caught his dimple on the side of his cheek, and when he smiled, they appeared, and just as quickly as they surfaced, they delved back into the smoothness of his skin.

The meeting ended, and awkwardly, he asked if I wanted a ride back.  I glanced at my wings, and then gazed at his strong arch on his back, his huge wings and his muscular torso.  I acquiesced.  I leapt onto his back and he flew up into the sky, carrying me on his back, flapping his thunderous wings and landing quite quickly near my home.  Before I left him, he asked me if I wanted to make a visit to a nearby village, one that neither of us had been to but had heard so much about.  I nodded enthusiastically.  All my fears that he might find my disagreeable dispelled with his invitation, with that, he left.

The next week crawled slowly with the usual chores of daily work.  I did not think of him.  The day approached that we would meet again, and as planned, he arrived at my home.  We were friends, weren't we?  Despite the reassurance I gave myself, my wings and fingers trembled chillingly.  There was no stopping the coldness.  It was neither the air or the temperature of the evening- it was him.  Rather than the clinched heat that would sweep past nervous lovers, he gave me a sense of iciness.  But we were only friends, weren't we?

The village was pretty uneventful.  We saw many sights, but there was no deep emotional or spiritual advancement.  Rather than absorbing the village experience, we experienced each other, shared out deeper thoughts and feelings.  My initial tension melted away in the moonlight.  While coming back from the village, I suggested going to the beach before he sent me home.

He sat down on the sand.  The cold sea breeze swept through his light brown hair and softly drained his warmth.  I dropped my sandals beside him.  Taking off my cloak, I slipped it around his shoulders.  Then, I sat down beside his body, finding some sanctuary beside his bulk.  It was quite humorous that he was wearing so little- just a little tunic- while I walked with him in my conglomerate of fancy cloaks and coats.

"I am a cold-freak," I mumbled.  It was true.  The cold sea breeze was a foreigner to me, and to protect my inner soft body, I had to wear extra clothes, sometimes, bundled up beyond comedy.  He smiled.  He rested his head on my left shoulder, and I wondered if he would cut himself on my body shoulder.  I asked him.  He denied.  I reached out to touch his cheek, my lips touched his, and the stars dimmed into the background.

~~~

It is the 9th day today.  I spoke with him, but briefly, momentarily.  Things are different.  I cannot see our future together.  Years from now, I will think back and miss him.  Years from now, he will think back and tell his children the mistake he made when he was seventeen.  He will tell his children how long it took for him to get past his mistake.  He will hold and hug the woman of his dreams.  He will play with his own offspring and deny the promises he made to me.   He will forget.  He will believe I was his mistake, his most unforgivable error.  I am the mistake of his manhood.

Flerian Origin
By Narcissus Blossomkiller

Long ago, when the lands were divided, long before the Spur was made, The races lived in separate lands, until one fateful day.  They fought amongst themselves, with battle-axe, sword and shield.  Some races, very powerful, had magick which they could wield.  Each separate race had a quality, which only they could possess.  But eventually their great differences caused nothing more than stress.  These differences could divide a race, and make its power few.  Eventually, the weapons sung, and mighty runes flew.  Few people know of this time and it's great animosity, and of it's lonely past.  That is the purpose of this tale, because our similarities are so vast.

Although they refuse to see, the Races are closer than at first they seem.  Each race is like another, in a sense we are all brothers.  

Today I speak of the little ones.  Who hide and dart at night.    At times you may feel a little tug.  Not knowing everything is nay all right.  Their hands are often found in purses of the rich and of the poor.  But the little long-fingered freaks are rightly connoisseurs.  In ancient times, when magick vast, flowed throughout the lands, the Flerians were created from their fellow hoo-man.  They were ne'r a mistake, nor were they a gift.  They were put here in this land, to create equilibrium.  The righteousness of the dragons old, began to crust and crumble.  Soon after this happened, the Arachnians and Penthanians began to stumble.  In arguments their tempers rose to boiling point and beyond.  This was started because of a joke, of which the Drag-Al are very found.  The legends surrounding this epic battle swirl and spin and fly.  Rumors surface every now and again, but few or more than lies.  

In mighty force the Arachnians grew.  Their knowledge of magick sublime.  The UnMagick stripped them of this, but it is told that it will return in time.  The final blow, of the Arachnians fight was to be a great success.  But when the Penthanians released their UnMagick.  The Arachnians plans were a mess.  'It is possible though that the knowledge remains on some long forgotten scroll.  Buried in a hole beneath the Spur, so very long ago.  In Flerian Lore a rumor lays claim to a hidden vault.  Inside a mighty crystal reigns but few know where it art.  On a fragile, dusty scroll, a scribe of the past did write, that the Gods foretold of a day where Flerians would rule the night.  The Scroll states, and I Quote, "The knowledge is hidden within."  As to WHAT this knowledge is; to guess, we can only begin.  'Some say that a miner of sorts, began to dig a hole.  And that buried beneath, somewhere in spur, we will someday find his soul.  He is said to point the way to truth of the Goblin-Al's great birth.  'But what ELSE he points to in modern times is now of greater worth.  His dexterous finger extended full towards were the vault doth lay.  He lies in the cavern forevermore, waiting there in state.  Around his neck he wears the name of the righteous one of Spur.  This single soul will save the future, and let the truth be known, that this name is of Flerian decent.  And lives within a Burrow.  Who's name this is, to this day, I dunnay know.

Now back to the task at hand.  The Flerian's creation.  All this I've told has room to stand for the truth is filled with frustration.  Frustration in that the truth will not be accepted by the Spur.  It is so dreadfully true, that most wish nay it were.  In the time when the UnMagick came, the Flerians of today didnay exist.  They were caught in the crossfire between UnMagick and Arachnian fist.  It is true that they never really called the Spur their home.  But they did have their own little Isle, which they named Flerome.  The Isle itself is treacherous. With many twists and turns.  Soon the "Flerians" or so they were called, Dug under the barren sod.  Here they found a shining star.  A crystal made of light.  Known as Actar, the crystal glows, making day from darkest night.  'It's rainbow patterns, a sight to see, and coveted from afar.  Soon when the word got out, all that was left of the crystal could fit in a jar.  'With the demise of the Stone which lit their home like the sun, They had little choice, but too move and try to make Spur their home.  Whilst in transit, they UnMagick came ripping through their group.  It was not very strong at that point, but they were still modified into a sideshow troop.  Their facial features drew up close, their fingers, they did extend.  Their eyes, they grew, they doubled in size, because of their mental complexities within.  They tried to make their home in Spur, but were ousted by the lot.  What became of the original travelers, the scroll of history do not.  Time had passed from then until the Flerians began to surface.  They found a job, albeit bad, and entered the thiefly workforce.  They again chose to go underground and try to build a burrow.  But the soil in spur was so hard; their fingers would nay go.  They are now just as scarce as they were before.  But soon the burrow shall rise again.  To be a formidable fighting force.

Remember this, if this alone, shall reach your deafly ears.  'The magick which the Arachnians lost shall resurface before their fears.  The rise of chaos is rightly so, but the Arachnians will nay take part.  Their Magick skills will nay return until the knowledge reaches the spider hearts.  'When such a time as this occurs, the magick will be so weak.  They will find it hard to cast at first, but the benefits are worth the wait.  The knowledge hidden beneath the Spur may someday have a use.  But until such a time, the Flerians must settle for abuse.

Now that's it, my tale is through, It was passed to me from my grandfather, as I pass it on to you.  Remember though, this is only Lore, which was handed down through the ages.  I'm fairly certain that this story has had many different stages.  Maybe it's true, or maybe  it's nay. But time will tell, for the Flers are here to stay......

Killing List -- First Dead
 By: Soulstar Sunflare


Chade woke at dusk but did not move from the bed until the sun was completely down.  He never did like the sun.  He hated its brightness and how long it always seemed to want to stay in the sky.  The only thing Chade enjoyed about the sun was the warmth it gave, nothing more.

It was not his fault he had been born and raised at night.  He always slept during the day, as his parents and teachers had always done.  It had caused him to become a creature of the night, and he would always remain that way.  Only once had he ever ventured out into the sun's light.  He had regretted it instantly when the sun blinded him with its brightness and started to burn on his pale skin.

"Besides," he thought as he threw off the covers, "I rather enjoy the cool, crisp, air of the night.  And I love the stars."

Chade rolled out of bed and strode over to the dresser.  He did not remember when he had unpacked everything in his backpack and had put it away.  He only knew he had a habit of doing that.

"Sleep walking again I bet," he chided himself as he opened the first two drawers and pulled out a dark blue tunic and a pair of matching leggings

He slipped both on, opened up the bottom drawer, and pulled out his makeup kit.  He put the kit aside and reached for the hair dye.  The dye he used last night was meant for quick disguises only.  He would be in his San Elf Fighter disguise for much longer tonight so he had to make sure it would stay the whole night.

He walked over to a sink of sorts and began dying his hair.  He had to use a lot more dye then most would have because he rarely cut his hair, and it had grown to almost waist length over the years.  He would probably have to cut it again before this mission was over, and he was not looking forward to that.

It took Chade almost a full fifteen minutes to dye and dry his hair.  The only thing that saved his clothing was that he had done this for most of his life and was very good at it.  He sat a while longer, darkening his complexion, before strapping on his sword belt and slipping into his armor.

"Odd how it seems to get noisier outside after the sun sets," He thought as he tied his hair back while walking down stairs to the tavern half below, "with all those races who need light to see, I would figure they would be out during the day, not at night."

Once downstairs, Chade ordered half a loaf of fresh bread, some sliced meat, and a mug of ale.  He sat down at the nearest table and made a sandwich.  The silence in which he ate was only broken on a rare occasion when someone walked into the Inn to look around.  Most of them wore novice titles and left Chade alone.

When he finished his short meal, Chade left the Inn for Town Square.  He was unsure of what he would find there.  He only hoped he would gain some inkling of who this Flerian he had to kill was. He entered the square as nonchalantly as he could.  It was sometimes hard not to walk with the grace those of his race possessed.  Even so, no one noticed him, a thing of which he was rather glad of.  He slipped into the shadows soundlessly and scanned the crowd.  He only heard snatches of different conversations, all which he ignored for they did not interest him.

There were only two Flerians in the entire area.  One was a hand cleric of Unknown.  The other was Setite thief.  Chade frowned at the two and started scanning the crowd again.  Neither was the one he wanted.

"If there is one thing I've learned from these missions," he thought boredly, "it's patience.  But that little burrowing hairball ought to have been here already.  Or so the cowering fools in Meetpoint had said.  Death knows how they would even know.  They probably already warned that an Usilin is looking for her."

Chade nearly laughed at that thought, "They never even had a clue what I really am."

He scanned about once more and sighed to himself.  He had no idea how much time had passed, nor did he really care, but he did notice that the Flerian hand cleric had left and the Thief was trying to resist the urge to work the crowd because of the Justice nearby.

"Justice Dredd?" he thought with a quick snort, trying not to let his amusement reveal him, "Dread me Justice, for you may be the one on my list."

The Justice was punishing an Arachnian who had tried to tear out a sign in TSC.  Chade would have applauded the spider had he been paying any attention to it.  He liked Arachnians, and always believed they were the only good ones to come from the Unmagick so long ago.

While Chade was on that train of thought, another Flerian entered TS.  She walked right passed everyone as if they were not there and hugged the Flerian thief.  The thief returned her hug and sighed as she started to scold him.

"Zeran, ya ain't suppose ta be here.  Ya know that," she said with only the faintest of frowns.

"I know Ceriana, but Voni and me were chattin and we ended up here.  'Sides, the thing's busy," Zeran said while pointing at the Justice.

"Ceriana?  Then she's the one I'm after.  A pathetic little hairy Setite heart cleric?" Chade wondered with some disgust, "Why her?"

"Come on, Zeran, back to da temple," Ceriana said while taking hold of Zeran's hand.

She mumbled a few words under her breath and both the Flerians were surrounded by a white aura.  They vanished seconds later.  Chade frowned deeply at that and stepped out of the shadows, startling a Frontacian next to him, but paid her no mind.  He passed through the southern gate deep in thought.  He was rarely told why he had be hired to assassinate certain people.  That never bothered him, he normally figured it out by the time he killed his target.  He wasn't as sure he would be able to discern the reasons for the killings this time.

He entered the Gilded Lion Inn and strolled up to his room, barely remembering to nod to the inn keeper's greeting.  He found his room cleaned, his bed made, and his pack resting neatly on top of the chest at the foot of the bed.  His frown only deepened at the sight and he hoped he would not have to kill the inn keeper for prying into things he should not be.

He opened his pack and rummaged through it, finding everything exactly the way it was when he left it earlier.  He pulled everything out of it and set them on the floor next to him.  At the bottom of the pack was a hidden compartment that could only be opened from the inside.  It was sealed by a simply lock spell that was quickly dispelled if one knew how.  He opened the compartment and grinned at its contents.  Six fangs lay nestled in thick soft padding.  Each was wrapped in a thick leather sheath.

"No point in taking any chances with these," Chade said aloud as he picked one up and slid it into his boot, out of view.

He quickly stored everything back into his pack, set it on the chest, and left the Inn.  Once outside he slipped into the shadows and slunk along the road to Town Square.  The Temple District may not be that far away from him, but he was not going to take the chance of having anyone seeing him.

He arrived at the portal of Set's temple within five minutes and passed through it noiselessly.  He stopped himself from traveling any further as he noticed muted voices coming from the altar room.  He looked into the room and saw Ceriana and Zeran playing poker on the altar.  Ceriana was winning and Chade would have bet anything Zeran was letting her.

Chade braced himself as the two stood up and exchanged a few words.  He tried not to mutter when Ceriana kissed Zeran just outside the door.  It seemed like forever before the two finally parted and Zeran entered the room Chade hid within.

Zeran was grabbed by the back of the neck just a few feet away from the portal and collapsed.  Chade smirked at the limp Flerian body and drug it into the shadows.  When he was sure the Flerian was well hidden he slipped back into the shadows and entered the altar room.

Ceriana sat by the altar, counting her winnings and muttering about Zeran always letting her win.  Not that she minded, she needed the favors the money would earn her.  Chade snuck up behind her and drew the fang from its sheath in his boot.  He wasted no time in any sort of prayer, but instead stepped out of the shadows and plunged the fang deep into Ceriana's back.  She let out a small squeak and spun around to stare into Chade's cold silver-white eyes.  She tried to call to Set to be healed, but he could not help her.

Chade always found it amusing to watch the life drain out of the eyes of his victims.  Especially when they were trying to pull daggers out of their own back and could not reach far enough.  He would never stab someone in the chest during an assassination.  He was a trained, professional, Assassin.  Doing such a thing was for the reckless recruits.  The one time he had stabbed his victim in the chest, he almost lost his own life.

Chade knelt down by Ceriana's lifeless body and lifted it up.  He dropped her face first onto the altar, sending coins and cards flying everywhere.  One of her arms hung over the edge and blood slowly began trickling down it.  Chade quickly collected the four aces and another random card.  He placed them on the floor below her arm to look as if she dropped them.  He scanned the room and noticed that the other cards laid strewn about almost perfectly.

"Murdered because she was cheating at poker," he said with a maniacal grin.

Thunder rolled through the city and Chade laughed defiantly at Set as he slipped back into the shadows.

Drag-al Mythos
By Fig Felonio

When I was a mere hatchling, my grandsire would tell me many stories from the lore passed down from generation to generation by my ancestors.  This was always my favorite.

	
Long ago, there was no world.  There was no water, no land, no air, merely a mixture of everything in the universe... the void.  Aspects of the void condensed and became real, creating three beings.  In the Drag-al tongue they were: Sha'kan, the creator, Kil'rin, the destroyer, and Ghe'tal, the watcher.          
	
Sha'kan looked at the void with disdain and attempted to order it.  He separated the earth from the water and made the lands and sea.  He took the fire and buried it deep within the earth, and put the air above it.  He then took the last element, Magick and infused everything with it.  He gazed upon this world with satisfaction.  He then began to create life.  First it was merely plants and insects and fish, then the larger animals and forests.  Finally, he made the first races, the Korka, now Usil Elves, as keepers of wisdom, and the Sivka, the Fir Elves, as keepers of the land.          
	
Kil'rin looked upon this world with disdain.  She used her store of raw elemental energy and rained it upon the land.  Sha'kan then used all his power to stop Kil'rin's attack.  From the elemental earth, he created the sturdy Hithual race.  From the air, he created the soaring Anthians.  From the waters, he made the great adapters, the Humans, from fire the noble Drag-al, and from Magick, the Frontacians.  Kil'rin became enraged at the deflection of her attempts at destruction.  She took the Elves and warped them into the Sanene to become her army.  She took the Humans and twisted them into Thugians and Oog-ra, strong and stupid workhorses.  The Anthians had their wings stolen and corrupted even more until they became Arachnians, and from the Hithuals came the sneaky Go-blin and Go-blin-al, her spies and thieves.  In her final and greatest piece of work, Kil'rin imbued Frontacians with part of her own essence.  When they rose again, they were the immortal and deadly Muatana-al.        
	
During this time Ghe'tal was merely watching.  It noticed the new races and the unbalancing effect they wrought upon the world.  It decided to create its own races to balance the new ones, and created the mighty Dragons. Eventually, the different sides were amassed for war.  The children of the creator on one side, and the spawn of destruction on the other.  The Dragons watched.  Being the progeny of chaos, and prone to rapid mood changes, many Sanene refused to fight and chose to join Ghe'tal in watching.  With decreased forces, Kil'rin was defeated and cast to the underworld.  Sha'kan took his place among the heavens, while Ghe'tal content to wander the world, watching.  The different races were dispersed upon the land, free to do as they chose.

Finally Alive
By Saphirre Lamara

Never have I felt like this,
It's all brand new,
Like a first kiss,
These feelings for you,
Cannot be chased away.
I am now complete.
My Life is finally true.

My heart aches when you're not here.
I want you to hold me,
And always to be near.
You captivate me like a mystery...
My heart is now yours,
It was yours since we met...

My life feels so pure!
My soul is ringing out with cries of a Love and a cure.
Whenever I see you my heart skips a beat,
Never has anyone swept this young khat off her feet,
Hold me again tonite, 'til we see the sun rise to the day and shine down its light.

The Phoenix

It is my one hundredth and twenty-fifth year since becoming aware of life around me, and it this account that I put thought to pen and ink. During this time, I have gone from gray to black, and back to gray again, and what this means is this is the tale of entropy, the lure of chaos and it's cost, and what should be, will be again.

In my travels, I have been often asked about my titles and my personal agendas. Perhaps this tale will assist in understanding a few pitfalls and dangers I have survived in my life, to ensure a longer life for you. 

As I had already written what it is to be a Dragon, there are many things that had been left out, these things being emotions, and states of mind a young Dragon will face while growing up. I have reflected upon this, and after some consideration, I will now make the attempt to put these thoughts on parchment. 

It all began back when I came to the Spur all those years ago, being naive, headstrong, and stubborn, I often talked myself into more strife than was necessary. I remember the days of thinking I was better than the very gods of Spur, and it's citizens that worship them. I look back and reflect on the days when I hunted the city's clergy, and having them finally take notice in an attempt to strike back at those Kyn that did join with me on those days. I am sure he could tell you a similar story. Anyway, while growing up, I began to study my surroundings, I gathered any and all information on Kyn that I could find, or lore I could hear from those that visited, such as Thiarin'a. In that time, of my first stage, I was still headstrong, but I became a thinker. Often would my pride draw me into the affairs of mortals, and it's misery that accompanies it, I would find myself questioning my every choice. As I continued to grow, I made many friends among the mortals, and I will be sad to see them pass on, and already a great deal have passed on. As I look back, I see that when I took over as DFC EIC, I did so as penance for the things I had done, and what I could do for Spur, and it's champions. Not being a Dragon of weapons, it was something I enjoyed. As I continued to grow away from my days of silliness, I came to meet my bonded, Pepperi, who at the time was drawing my attention as kindred spirits do. 

Pepperi opened my eyes, to a great many things, whether she knows it or not, it is the inherent wisdom that is born within innocence that one will see. When life became overly complicated, it was the simple suggestions from Pep that shone a light on things in different ways. From the day I staged, my life changed forever. And for at least a little while, I was whole. I found out, that knowledge is a powerful thing, and power perhaps corrupted my thoughts, as I began to become the black dragon my skin portrayed within my heart. Never had I felt such loss and angst by becoming something I could not stand to be. It was chaos, and its meetings that changed me, firstly with Arioch, whom I've had the distinct displeasure of meeting in person. First my pride, then my ego destroyed me, by his touch, I did die, and as with it, a part of me within died that day as well. To have the light of one's soul held in the tiny hands of one so small, is truly great. Today, little ones are taken for granted, and this shall soon end, if I have anything to say of this. Those that abuse and injure little ones, need know only one thing: Death will come for those that touch the little ones. Do not doubt these words. Here is a word of the wise for Kyn, if you see a Secian in harm's way, gladly give your own life and body to protect the little ones. Do so without hesitation, for they would gladly take your pain, you should do so for them as well. I cannot stress this point enough to protect the little ones at all costs, even if it means pain and death for you my Dragons, it is a small price if any.  As I recall, jumping from one point to another in life, always have the little ones been here for me, and always did a smile creep upon my black lips. Never again will I feel that loss.

That was the day I awoke from my nightmare.

All my accomplishments, my work, all that for which I had fought and bled for, seemed gone. Nothing did I have to show for my past, but fear, and pain. Fear from the looks of the Spurians that came across my path. There has always been a respect, but it was now out of fear, and not friendship I once had from the many that knew me. On this day, my nightmare ended, and I emerged from my shell. Today I breath in air as I did in my youth, pure. Today I have cast away my chaos, for it is the bane of Kyn. I awake to find that I am a High Lord, where once I was a simple member of the former Architects guild. I find I have a house, which I am glad to have and now share. I found I had knights and a lord below me, and since this day, I have released them all from their vow to me. I recall being a bard at heart, and I long to return to those days. All of my creative thoughts had been driven from my body, and in time, perhaps it will return. 


As I look upon the days of the past, I feel whole again, and I feel relief from my little one's soul. I can tell now that it was tearing her apart from within, it ends now. I look to the youth and Kyn that now walk in the Spur, and sometimes I see myself in them, I see days I shall miss, and I see those that follow my dark path. To those that follow into darkness, take this as a warning, it is not the path you seek. I have seen what it has done to my Kyn, I see what it does now, and it is not something one should take lightly. Open your eyes to life and see truly what it is you fly over, or walk upon. To pass this up, is to be without soul. To use a little one for nothing more than staging, you already are without soul. For when I staged, I shared my little one's soul, but I did not give anything back to her, now, I will see that I do share my life with her. Bonding should go without saying brings a friendship one should not walk past. 

May this, and your life, show you your path. May your path take you to your dreams.

A Forgefist Drinking Song
By Meqelth Forgefist

Oh tired one in from the mines,
Oh worn from the battlefield,
Oh weary one back from the forge,
Oh spent from the ground just tilled.

Well met, my friend, pull up a chair,
Maybe spin a tale or two,
Recharge yer spirit, refill yer soul,
With the lands most-perfect brew!

Oh all is well!  When ye have ale!
Drink all ye have, there's more on sale!
Oh I like wine!  But ale's divine!
Hithual ale is the most fine!

Refill yer mugs, then empty them,
And refill yer mugs again,
Yer strength's reborn and ye feel great,
Praise Hithual ale, my kin!

Drink, drink, drink, and drink ye some more!
Drink, drink, drink, just stay off the floor!
Drink, drink, drink, and sing me a song!
Drink, drink, drink, and ye'll do no wrong!

Because...
Oh all is well!  When ye have ale!
Drink all ye have, there's more on sale!
Oh I like wine!  But ale's divine!
Hithual ale is the most fine!

But, Ohhhh...., should the ale run dry.....
But, Ohhhhhh...., should the ale run dry.....
Ohhhhh...., into our mugs we'll cry.....
While the joy of life doth die....

Ohhhhh...., lift up yer voice and wail....
Ohhhhhhh...., lift up yer voice and wail....
And repeat the woeful tale....
Until they bring us more ale!

And then...
Drink, drink, drink, and drink ye some more!
Drink, drink, drink, just stay off the floor!
Drink, drink, drink, and sing me a song!
Drink, drink, drink, and ye'll do no wrong!

Because...
Oh all is well!  When ye have ale!
Drink all ye have, there's more on sale!
Oh I like wine!  But ale's divine!
Hithual ale is the most fine!

For Hithuals our life is blest,
Cause we have glee in our souls,
Without ale the rigors of life,
Would then be taking their tolls.

But as long as we have our ale,
And friendships that never end,
We can face our trails with joy,
And the hurts of heart doth mend.

And so...
Drink, drink, drink, and drink ye some more!
Drink, drink, drink, just stay off the floor!
Drink, drink, drink, and sing me a song!
Drink, drink, drink, and ye'll do no wrong!

Because...
Oh all is well!  When ye have ale!
Drink all ye have, there's more on sale!
Oh I like wine!  But ale's divine!
Hithual ale is the most fine!

Oh all is well!  When ye have ale!
Drink all ye have, there's more on sale!
Oh I like wine!  But ale's divine!
Hithual ale is the most fine!

Them Wacky Peoples...
By Frason Dranco

(Disclaimer- This is going to be shades of both Out of Character and In Character talk merged in a sticking shade of gray; you have been warned.)

Greetings, Spurians at home and abroad. That 45% accurate article "Spur on two Silver" will be continued at a later date, for now I want to hit on an issue that has plagued Spur for over a year now.

It doesn't matter what you call them, and each race has their own way of doing so: "Rogues" "Insanites" "Un-Secianly" "Honorless Minature Poodle", etc. etc. We all have problems with people who just don't seem to quite 'get it'. Whether it's a San Elf suing for peace or a Secian trying to instigate a war, it is just quite annoying.

In order to carefully treat your case (as opposed to hitting them over the head with large unwieldy objects), you need to see how far down the roots of insanity spread.

Minor insanity: These people act well past what we would coin 'normal', but do so not because of that tiny dark glee in their hearts when they do, but because they just don't know otherwise.

Major insanity: People who are torn by the grip of pure insanity. They don't care about the world around them or the bodies they were born with. They have been told repeatedly and tried to nurture out of their strange state, but won't budge.

A Minor case of insanity can be handled in either a passive or active way:

Passive-The role-model system. Show them how the world operates by operating in the world repetitively. Do that mythical rite called 'Roleplay' in their presence a lot, and try to be a constant presence in their life.

Active-The less gentle approach being dragging them off to some place and whispering to them, after invoking the demonic runespell 'Out [of] Character', what they are doing particularly glaringly wrong, tell them you wish to help them, and your suggestions.

Notice all suggestions for Minor fits of insanity do not revolve around the use of blunt objects. There is a reason for this; if someone is merely lacking the knowledge they require to operate effectively in our world, then it's best to give it to them, not scare the  bejees out of them.

Major fits...sadly, these can't be helped. If someone is knowingly spreading wanton disruption, casting the strange and demonic 'Out [of] Character' spell everywhere they go, and just making life for the rest of us Hell, and -enjoying- it, they will continue to do so. However, there -are- some ways you can cope with it.

A- Ignore the fool. This is usually the best method to deal with the younger ones. If they learn they are not amusing anyone (including themselves), they will more then likely pack up for browner pastures.

B- Walk away. A more active approach to A is just leave the fool in the dust. While not the most efficient method of getting the point across that you wish they would go away, it does work.

C- Large blunt objects can be used to thwap the person every time they do something disruptive and memoric. While this usually is the least effective way of doing so, it does give you that warm feeling inside.

D- The more violent way. Kill On Sight lists typically involve...well...Killing the fool On Sight. I personally think this is ineffective and barbaric, but so many people use it as to be a viable alternative. I do ask that if you do practice this, dragging the idiot's corpse some where were it can't whine and chatter while dead?

E- Beg to a higher power. The last straw in insanity removing agents. While it is (and should be) rarely done, it is rather effective. Note however even insane people have 'children', and it is not always a permanent fix. To invoke your Gods and your Elders in such errands, however, would have to require a massively disruptive and insane person: Not an option to be used lightly.

I hope in some small part that this article might help you better understand and then deal with the always there problem of insane people. While the numbers might be dwindling of their ilk coming around Spur, they will always be here, and while they are here they will always need to be watched for.

The Gift of Vision
 Dictated by : ¥ulin Rochelet
 Scribed ( and edited by ) : Lache Rochelet
 
 Less then a handful seasons ago, I took a trip back to the place of my birth, the Firian village of F'ythlinol'Rochin.  The trip was a long one, since the village lies many tendays from the forests around the Spur.  During my trip, I came across a small shrine near a small human settlement.  The shrine was a circle in the ground, formed of white stone which were polished smooth.  The Shrine was small, measuring roughly twenty paces at it's widest point.  Sitting in the middle of this circle was a blackened stump, polished to a deep shine, with runes inscribed upon it.  Two small bowls, one of ivory and one of wood sat in front of the alter.  Wildflowers, holy to my Goddess, surrounded the shrine on all sides.
 
 Curious, I approached this holy place, wanting to know just what this was.  My master and mentor hand trained me in these very hills, but I was not familiar with this spot.  I stepped within the circle, and immediately felt the power of my Goddess's blessings upon the shrine.  But there was also the blessings of another entity upon this place, and it took me just a moment to discern from whence this power came: the Goddess Rinanni.   "Both Goddesses in one place?" I murmured.  Even more curious now, I approached the altar and started to examine it when I felt the presence behind me.  In one swift ( and very practiced ) motion, I whirled around in place, with bow in hand and arrow nocked, facing what was now confronting me.
 
 As I turned I saw two priests standing just outside the Circle.  Both were clad in ivory robes covering all but their hands.  Gray shapes and runes looking like forest animals covered the cloth, and seemed to move as the priests breathed.  Green chord was wrapped around their waists, and their feet were bare.  I could not even see their faces, as the hoods of their robes were pulled to conceal them.  The first one stood my height, looking rather thin and frail.  The second priest was much shorter and seemed to be much broader.
 
 I stood there for what felt like hours.  Never had I seen Priests clad in such garb.  It was typical of neither of the churches which has surely called this place holy.  None of us moved, with the tension in the air feeling heavier and more stifling with each passing moment.  They were the first to break the silence.
 
 "Greetings, Sal'riEndale." The voice of the second immediately told me that she was female, and an Anthian.  "Your arrival has been expected for some time now.  You look well since the last time we met."
 
 Stunned that they apparently knew me, I stood there, speechless.  Both stepped slowly  into the circle, the taller one walking around to the back side of the altar.  The second one stepped up beside me, raising her head to show her lovely face.  She was most definitely Anthian, and familiar.
 
 "Moonwing?" I asked tentatively.  She smiled, which informed me that she was indeed the forester I had first meet upon my arrival to Spur.  We had spent just short of a tenday together, with her teaching me the ways of a Forester in the Spur and surrounding regions.  I had not seen her in over eighteen months, as she had disappeared shortly after our meeting.
 
 "What are you doing here, little sister?  What happened that caused you to leave the Spur?"
 
 She smiled at me, sat down, and patted the ground beside her.  "That, dear one, is a long story.  But now is not the time.  Let us just say that the Goddesses brought me here, to the service of the lady."  Moonwing bowed her head towards the figure now apparently sitting on something behind the altar.  The Lady, as my old friend called her, raised her head to reveal the face of Usilin Female.   A silver band rested upon her brow, but what caught my attention was the blood-red blindfold covering her eyes.
 
 "M...M'lady"  I said, as I bowed. I made a quick, ceremonial gesture towards the altar, and then sat down beside my long-time friend.  Moonwing smiled, then also made the same gesture.  The lady smiled, and nodded her head.
 
 "You do not know me, Sal.  My name is Athyni, HighCleric of the Order of Twi'si'lyn, Twin Goddesses."
 
 "Twin Goddesses?" I asked tentatively.
 
 Athyni smiled, and nodded.  "Yes, Sal.  Twin Goddesses.  The Goddess you follow, and her holy sister known as Rinanni are known by some to be the Twin Goddesses.  This is their shrine, their Ezyin'inith.  I was called here ten years ago to this very place, and met both holy ladies on this very spot."
 
 I nodded, knowing that several different sects of most religions existed all over the lands.  Although, I never had recalled hearing of a church following both deities.  Not knowing what else to do, I just smiled.  As did the High Cleric.
 
 "You are wondering why this blindfold is over mine eyes, Sal."  My mouth dropped, which she obviously detected and smiled.  "You do not have a necessity to worry, blessed son.  I can not read minds, or detect thoughts.  I have just become accustomed to being in darkness, and my senses have become such that I miss my sight no longer."
 
 I nodded, not knowing what else to do at this point.
 
 "Relax, Sal.  You ask, therefore you shall receive." Athyni reached behind the altar, and pulled out a set of scrolls.  I stood up, and moved in front of the altar, watching as she placed the scrolls on the blessed stump and unrolled them.  The scrolls were brown with age and wear, but when she opened them, the words were bright and clear, as though they had been written the hour before.  The language of the firs jumped out at me, clear as day.  I looked up at this apparent priestess, who nodded at me.
 
 "Read, Blessed son."
 
 "Thank ye, yer grace."  I pushed the scrolls open, then started to read.
 
*******************
 
 "I, Athylith'o'sai of Shyne, HighCleric of the Order of Twi'si'lyn, write this so that all may know the blessing the sisters have bestowed upon my cousins this day, and the reasons thereof."
 
 "Five years ago, a young Fir came to this shrine looking for a place of rest.  He was young, and beautiful, like the forest floor in the dew-soaked morn.  He first gave his offerings to Elindale, and then proceeded to talk with me, the newly appointed HighCleric of my sect.   We talked the evening away.  His name was Solynor, and he stayed here for several days, just talking and sharing the blessing of the sisters with me."
 
 "He left shortly thereafter, due to the callings of Elindale.  But he came back regularly, spending time with me.  He was a son of the forest, and spent much time protecting the small villages from creatures that would assault them.  I saw him grow much in strength, faith, and stature.  He became a great huntsman and archer, and even finally a holy Knight of Elindale.  He met several adventuresome people, and brought those who followed either of the sisters here for worship."
 
 "This went on for a full year, and after each trip I longed that much more for his presence by my side.  I tried to keep my thoughts on my duties, but found more and more my mind wandering to that handsome face, longing for the next time he should visit me.  Soon thereafter, he came back to the shrine in his ceremonial armor of his holy station.  He got on his knee, looked me in the eye, and asked me to join him in holy marriage.  My heart sang that day, as I knew that I was going to spend the rest of my life by his side, singing the praises of the Goddesses."
 
 "We were married the next day, and what a holy and precious day it was.  Everything was slightly brighter and slightly more filled with joy than usual as I remember it.  My husband was looking as handsome and regal as ever, and it seemed that even the holy inscriptions and symbols around the shrine exuded joy that day."
 
 "We spent several months together, making our home in a small clearing just outside the perimeter of the shrine.  I continued to serve the Goddesses, and he continued his work, protecting the peoples of the surrounding country side.  Many nights did I lay awake, wondering where my husband was, only to fall into his arms as he came home a day or two later."
 
 "But one night, he did not return.  Nor the next.  Three days and nights passed this way, until, just before sunset on the fourth day, several of Solynor's friends came up to the shrine, looking very sullen and sad.  Behind them, carried in a small cart, was the body of my husband."

 "After the initial shock and grief that I felt, I wiped my tears away and asked his companions what happened.  A human by the name of Ba'new stepped forward and told me that my husband had died at the hand of brigands, folk Solynor had made enemies of while following the calling of the Goddesses.  Apparently, my husband had slain the leader of one bands during a raid, and the band wanted retribution."
 
 " 'And how faired him in this fray?'  I asked, hoping in the back of my mind that he had taken several of his foes with him.  At least I could feel better about his being pulled away from me."
 
 " 'He did as good as could be expected, m'lady.  But it was night time, which put him at a disadvantage, for being alone, at night, his bow was useless to him without light for which to see his targets.   And while Sol was very talented with his blade, his precision with the arrow is what made him feared in these parts.' "
 
 "I buried my husband on the hill north of the shrine with the help of his friends.  We held a quick service,  and then they departed back to the woods, leaving me to grieve.  And grieve I did, for almost a full ten-day upon the altar, wondering all this time why Solynor was torn from me."
 
 "The last day of that ten-day, again, before going to bed, I visited the grave of my husband.  After a hour or two there I went to the shrine and wept upon the altar of my Goddesses, crying and sobbing, trying to understand the meaning of it all.  Suddenly, around me a bright light filled the area.  Shocked, surprised, and dismayed that someone would dare interrupt me in my time of grief, I stood up quickly, only to drop down on my knees again, realizing whose presence I now stood in."
 
 " 'You weep, child.  Why is that?'  asked the first of the figures.  The voice was overpowering, and loving.   I felt both fear and trepidation that my Ladies would bless me with their presence at this moment, when I was at my weakest."
 
 "I took a breath, looked up at both Goddesses, and said 'My husband has died in you service, my ladies.  That is why I weep.  I am sad because I do not understand why he was taken from me when he has done nothing but happily served you.' "
 
 "One of the Ladies, who I now realized was the incarnation of Rinanni, stepped forward and took me in her arms.  The peace and love in that embrace was staggering, but still my sorrow held me slightly at bay.  I looked over Rinanni's shoulder to see Elindale looking me right in the eyes, hers filling with tears as she understood my sorrow."
 
 " 'My child,' begin Rinanni, 'your love will always be with you in more ways that you comprehend at this moment.  And while we understand your sadness, understand that I am in celebration of the love that you shared, and the time you spent together.' "
 
 "Her words were comforting and loving, but they still did not completely take away my pain.  I nodded, for that is all I could do at the time, and then broke down in tears.  At this point, Elindale stepped forward, and took me in her arms, holding me just a breath away from her face."
 
 " 'Daughter, your grief is understandable.  But you must also understand Solynor died in my service, and lived his life following my will.  While his time on this plane is done, he will forever be a blessed son in my house.' "
 
 "Again I nodded, still feeling pain and loss.  Elindale looked me in the eyes, sighed and spoke again."
 
 " 'My words do not comfort you, daughter.  Therefore, to perhaps console you that your beloved did not die in vain, I will place this curse upon you.  Your husband died at night, when he was not fully able to defend himself without the light of fire or sun.  I will bless his people with the ability to see at night, so they will be able to use their abilities with the bow.  But the cost shall be your own vision, and the vision of those who follow you as the HighCleric of your order and sect.' "
 
 "I was taken aback, then, gathering my strength, said to her 'My Goddess, while it will bless others, I do not wish to have the gift of sight.  I want no longer to see the beauties that surround me, if my husband can not share them with me.  Therefore, I accept your curse, with the knowledge that my husband's kin can better defend themselves from the dangers at night.' "
 
 "Elindale nodded, kissed my forehead, and said "It is so, my daughter.  At some time in each Firian life, they shall develop the vision for night sight, at the price of yours and those who follow you.  Let this be a reminder to you always that the ways of the Goddesses are not to be questioned or doubted, for we have a vision beyond what you can comprehend.  And know that we love you, our HighCleric.' "
 
*******************
 
 The text stopped there.   I stood, hands trembling, now understanding the reason why not six months prior, I was suddenly able to see at night.  I looked up at the High Cleric, not knowing what to say.  She smiled, again with that knowing smile that told me she knew what was going though my mind.

 "So you see, Sal, why your kin develop the night sight.  Every time a HighCleric of Ezyin'inith, this Shrine to the Twin Goddesses, is chosen, she is kissed by the Goddess Elindale herself, and her sight fades so that other might see.  We all then wear the blood-red bandage in remembance of the fallen Knight Solynor."
 
 "But some of my kin develop the night sight earlier than others, m'lady.  I know of some who have it at birth, while others have developed it after much of their life has passed.  Why is that?"
 
 She shrugged.  "I know not, and care not to question it.  That is part of the leason of the tale."
 
 	I nodded. "M'lady, others of my kin will want to know this story, so that this shrine may be paid proper homage.  Can I take this script with me, so that I may let others copy it and spread the word among the faithful?"
 
 She smiled.  "But of course, Sal.  Why do you think I showed this to you?"  She chuckled at her own private joke.  "You are indeed one of the truly blessed children of the Goddess,  but you are only one.  Elindale wishes all of her children to know the truth."
 
*******************
 
 I spent the rest of the day there with my old friend and the HighCleric of the Twin Goddesses, learning several more stories and teachings from them.  I left the next night, taking with me a copy of the story the HighCleric had prepared for me.  I found the sanctuary of my order, and visited with the other Knights of the Goddess.  I left a copy of the holy text for them so that other Sal'riEndale could learn the truth of Elindale's gift.  Upon my return to the Spur, I sat down with my cousin Lache the Usil, who scribed this scroll from my dictation, as well as the copy given to me.
 
 May the blessing of the Holy Goddess Elindale bless this text and all who read it.

Astraea
By Kassandra Shadowslinker

A small shadow separated itself from the rest and hurried across the field, towards the village. It stopped suddenly, looked around, then slipped behind a tree, pulling the hood back away from its face, and the corner of the cloak off of the bundle it carried. The mother looked down at her sleeping child, a single tear rolling off of her cheek.
	
"My baby," she said softly, her voice not above a whisper, "I am sorry." Clutching the bundle against her body, she turned away from the tree and slunk towards the house that stood near-by, separated a short way from the rest of the village. Listening for any movement within the house, she walked silently up to the doorstep and gently set the baby down. With an almost silent sob, she turned and fled back into the forest.

*	*	*

Lera sat quietly, her book resting on the arm of the chair. The orange and white cat she had found last month lay curled in her lap, purring softly as she stroked his fur. The candle resting on the table beside the chair was burning low, but she couldn't sleep. She was tired, yes, she hadn't slept in days,  but there was something that just wouldn't let the slumber come and take her. So, she read endlessly, book after book. Her husband was beginning to worry about her, for this was strange, even for one of the Usilin blood. She insisted he pay her no mind, that it would pass soon. A thin sliver of doubt crept through her, though. She had never had this sort of problem before, and could not find a cure for it in all of her texts.
	
Suddenly, the cat sat bolt upright, the hair along his back standing straight up, his tail puffed out thrice its normal size. He growled low in his throat, then hissed, staring straight at the front door. Lera glanced at him, then looked towards the door. She picked him off her lap-wincing slightly as his claws caught on her skin-and set him on the floor. Picking up the candle, she stepped quietly towards the door, runes dancing above her head, then settling in a protective shield around her. She took a deep breath, nerving herself, then cracked the door open, peering cautiously through. 
	
Nothing was there. Her brow furrowed and she opened the door wider, sticking her head out and looking around. Still nothing. She began to close the door, when the cat pushed past her legs and out onto the step. Muttering something beneath her breath, she bent to retrieve him when she saw the bundle. It appeared to be faintly glowing in the moonlight. The cat nudged it with his nose, and a thin cry sounded from the bundle. Lera's jaw dropped and the shield lost cohesion and flew apart, she was too surprised to maintain it. She fell to her knees and picked the small bundle up, cradling it in her arms. Pulling back the cloth covering the baby's face, she gasped, and swooned.
	
"Oh my Goddess! A Sanene child!" she exclaimed, almost dropping the bundle. Quickly she gained control of herself and studied the baby, having little experience with them. It appeared to be a newborn, for its eyes were still shut, had only the faintest patch of hair on its head, and was as ugly as only a newborn could be. She held it close against her and stood, walking back into the house, her eyes transfixed on the child.
	
Hearing the initial wail of the infant, Korin was startled from his sleep. Reaching over to pull Lera protectively against him, he found her place empty. Sighing softly, he rose from the bed, drawing the thin dagger he kept in a sheathe fixed to the bottom of the nightstand. Stepping quietly so as not to alert whatever intruder had gained entry to his home, he steeled himself and was just about to peeked out from behind the wall when he heard the second screeching cry. Forgetting about stealth, he whirled out into the main room, jumping back when Lera shrieked in surprise, the baby in her arms crying out loudly again from the sudden sound.
	
"What in the name of the gods is THAT?!" Korin exclaimed, staring in shock at the bundle Lera held tightly against her chest.
	
"It... it's..." She stumbled on the words, a look of dismay at her husband's reaction clouding her usually serene face. "It's a child! A newborn!" Holding the child against her, she was trying to shield the child's true identity from her husband, though she knew it was hopeless. "Someone left it on the step, and I heard it crying, "she rushed on, hoping to gain his sympathy before revealing to him the nature of the babe, "its mother has abandoned it, and oh, love, how I wish to keep it. We have none of our own and-"
	
"Let me see it," Korin said and stepped to her side, reaching down to pull the swaddling away from the tot's face. By this time, it had calmed down and was only whimpering quietly, its tiny fists curled besides its mouth. Korin stared silently down at the bundle, a mixture of emotions flashing across his face-amazement, disbelief, horror, and then he just stared blankly and slowly stepped away from Lera.
	
"Pleas-" Lera began, but he cut her off with a gesture of his hand.
	
"You know what will happen if we keep that-that-thing. Love," he gazed down at her, his expression softening a little, "I want a child just as much as you do, but do you really think they well allow a child of the dark blood to live here?"
	
"It is a baby, not a thing! And I know what they will say and I do not care. You know as well as I that my magicks are quite formidable and I will not hesitate to use them in defense of this child. My beloved, 'tis only a child and with proper Usilin upbringing, it could grow into caring and noble person. Its mother left it on our front step for a reason-surely you cannot argue with a mother's instincts, even if it is a San's?" Lera raised her chin defiantly, and Korin say in her eyes that she meant every word she said and arguing would be useless. Sighing heavily and throwing his hands into the air, he said, "Fine, my heart. Have it your way. But be prepared for the fight of your life." Lera beamed at him and kissing him exuberantly, bustled into the bedroom and set about making a room for the child.
	
"'Tis a daughter, my love! A beautiful girl!" she called and Korin could not help but smile.

*	*	*	*
	
Less then a moon later, the girl-child was presented to the Gray Council. Lera had named her Astraea because on that night, it seemed as if a little star and lain on her front step. Standing before the Council, she held herself proudly, little Astraea tucked in the crook of her arm and cooing softly, giggling quietly and trying to grab a lock of Lera's hair which was dangling just out of her reach.
	
The head of the Council, Mith'ranir looked down at Lera and the child, unmasked contempt marring his features. Bent and withered with age, with only a few scraggly white hairs sprouting from his skull, he looked far from imposing. But a shiver of fear and apprehension shot down Lera's spine. She had seen what he could do with his magick, even if he was well over two hundred years old. 
	
"Lera," he croaked in a quavering voice, "present your case."
	
Nerving herself, Lera smiled up at the Council and dropped into a deep curtsy. Rising slowly, careful not to tip the child, she gazed calmly up the Ancients and spoke in a clear voice with carried out across the council chamber, "My Lords, less then one moon ago, this child was left on my doorstep by a mother who could not care for her. This mother obviously had enough sense to realize that we could raise this child to be caring and compassionate. She knew that we could instill into this innocent being the learning and love required to make a decent and noble person."
	
Mith'ranir stared down at her from the high council dais, his expression stony. The other council members fidgeted in their seats, glancing over at him. "The child is a San," he rasped, "the law states all those of Sanene blood will be killed on sight. You know that as well as any of us, Lera. That child was left here to be raised by us and accepted into our village, only to betray us to his brethren so that we can be taken as slaves!"
	
Lera snorted softly and mustering her courage, glared up at Mith'ranir. "That is nonsense and you know it! 'Tis but a babe! This child will be taught the evils of Sanene ways! She will be one of US, not one of THEM!"
	
Most of the council had begun to nod their heads in agreement with Lera. "Mith'ranir," spoke up Julask, one of the Scholars, "she is right. A child raised as a Usil, regardless of the race, will learn to accept our culture and ways. Studying the effects of Usilin way on a Sanene will be most fascinating, to say the least. If, by some chance, I am wrong, we can always kill it." He shrugged indifferently and settled back in his chair.
	
Grateful that Julask had taken her side, she was displeased that he was considering her baby to be nothing more than an beast in an experiment. She forced herself to swallow the bitter remark that sprang to her lips, and stood quietly, hardly daring to breathe. Mith'ranir looked at Julask for a long time, then shifted his gaze to the child in Lera's arms. After what seemed like a lifetime, he sighed and flicked his fingers in dismissal at Lera.
	
"Take your child and go home. You may raise her as one of us, but if we sense any rebellion or betrayal, she will be killed."
	
Her breath came out in rush and she beamed up at Mith'ranir, then turned on her heel and fled out of the Hall, hurrying home to tell Korin the news.

*	*	*	*

Astraea peeked out from behind the tree, casting her gaze around the Square before darting out into the open, making a dash for the fountain. Out of nowhere, a Usilin boy about her age leaped from behind a nearby building and tackled her. Recovering quickly, she rolled out of the way and slipped her belt knife from it's sheathe, sinking into a defensive crouch. The boy, grinning wickedly at her, drew a thin blade from his boot and advanced towards her, casually flipping the dagger from hand to hand. With lightning quickness, Astraea dropped to the ground and shot her leg out, catching the boy off guard and bringing him to the ground. Leaping to her feet, she dropped her knee onto his chest and held her knife to his throat.
	
"Blast it all to-" the boy's curses were cut off by Astraea's merry laughter. She got off of his chest and slipped her knife back into her sheathe, then held out her hand and helped the boy to his feet.
	
"You nearly knocked the breath out of me when you tackled me, Feroth!" She grinned at him and punched his shoulder playfully. Chuckling at her, he pulled her closer to him and tickled her on her ribs. She squealed softly and twisted away from him then bolted for the nearest stand of trees. Whooping with challenge, he darted after her, slowing when he reached the grove for she had disappeared into the shadows. 
	
Grinning to himself, he crept into the grove, hiding behind a tree then whirling around to face the front of it, expecting to find Astraea hiding there. Somewhere off to his left, he heard a stifled giggle. Turning in that direction, he paused for a moment in the shadow of a massive oak. Astraea smiled wickedly and hooked her legs over the branch she was sitting on, then fell back silently, hanging by her knees right behind Feroth. Biting back her laughter, she dropped a small stick on the ground. Feroth, hearing it fall, whirled around and shrieked when he saw her hanging there and jumped back about six paces. Laughing gleefully, Astraea pulled herself back up onto the branch, then quickly started to scale the branches, climbing towards the top.
	
"Oh no you don't, you little-little-elf!" Feroth exclaimed and began to claim after her. Astraea laughed down at him and continued climbing, pausing in her upward progress to grab a branch and swing to another side of the tree.
	
"Astraea! Time to come home!" Lera's voice carried into the grove and Astraea could see her standing by the fountain.
	
"Aw, Mother, must I? Feroth and I were playing the most wonderful game of Catch-Me!"
	
"Now, young lady!"
	
Sighing loudly, Astraea cast a wink down at Feroth as tiny runes began dancing and swirling above her head. A sparkling silvery aura surrounded her and in a shimmer of rainbow color, she disappeared from the tree branch, only to reappear in front of her mother.
	
"Thanks, you little whelp! You could have at least cast one at me!" Feroth shouted from the tree as he began the long descent down.
	
Smirking to herself, Astraea called back, "As you wish, O Great One!" The runes began to circle above her head again, then flew towards Feroth.
	
"Wait! I didn't mea-" Feroth yelled as the runes danced around him, his words cut off as the rainbow shimmer formed around him as he was stepping down from one branch to the next. In an eye-blink he was hovering in the air before Astraea for a split-second, then fell to the ground at her feet.
	
He glared up at her in mock anger as he climbed to his feet and dusted himself off, then flexed his fingers as if he were going to tickle her again. Shrieking at the very thought, she ducked behind Lera who shook her head and chuckled.
	
"I think that's quite enough children. Now, Astraea, it's time for you to come in. It's getting dark and you must practice your spells before bed.
	
"Yes, mother. I shall be inside in just a moment. I've got to fetch my spellbooks from the fountain." Astraea gave her mother a quick hug, then dashed towards the fountain. Feroth winked at Lera, then dashed after Astraea.
	
"Hey, look, it's the San lover." Porthon sneered at Feroth, a malicious smirk curving his mouth. Four of Porthon's flunkies materialized from the shadows and crowded around him, snickering at Feroth.
	
Ignoring them, Feroth strode up to Astraea and scooped his books out of her arms, smiling down at her. "Don't pay any attention to them, 'Traea, their only a bunch of dimwits who couldn't cast a spell to warm a glass of milk."
	
Astraea glanced over at Feroth and managed a weak smile, "They're taunting you more than I. I know they're just jealous, but I don't think it's fair they can bully us around and get away with it." She sighed softly and began to walk towards her house.
	
Feroth put his arm around her shoulder and walked with her, grumbling beneath his breath about dimwitted Usil who were no better then Firs. Suddenly, a rock whizzed by his ear, missing his head by a fingerwidth. A second rock struck him directly between the shoulder blades. Astraea whirled around, an blue aura springing up around she and Feroth just in time to deflect the next stone. Growling softly, her eyes glinting dangerously, she glared at Porthon and his gang.
	
Porthon leered back at her, casually tossing a stone into the air and catching it again. "Aw, what's wrong, San? Did I hurt your boyfriend?" He grinned at her spitefully.
	
Before she could stop herself, Astraea had invoked the runes. First, a fist of fire lashed out at Porthon, catching him directly in the chest, knocking him to the ground. He rolled around, howling in pain and anger as he tried to bat it out, burning his hands in the process. Then whips of wood and leather struck each of his goons, sending them running and yelping as they tried to run from them.
	
"How do you like THAT, you worthless thug? Do you like a taste of your own medicine?" Astraea howled in rage, more runes circling above her, several flaming darts streaking from her to strike Porthon, setting more of his clothing a-flame. 	

Feroth groaned softly and Astraea suddenly halted her attack and kneeled beside her friend, an aura of healing gently washing over him as she whispered the invocation.
	
"Feroth? Feroth! Please, are you alright?" She shook him and he opened his eyes, staring up at her blankly. He blinked and sat up, staring around him. He caught sight of Porthon, still rolling and writhing on the ground and his jaw dropped.
	
"Astraea..." He grimaced as a strangled cry of pain escaped Porthon, "Astraea, dispel it."
	
"But-but-he hurt you! He hit you with a rock! He could have killed you!"
	
"Dispel it, Astraea! Now!"
	
Astraea closed her eyes and concentrated. The fire on Porthon went out with a soft *poof*. 
	
Lera, who had been struck numb with shock, ran over to Feroth and Astraea, kneeling beside them to make sure Feroth was okay, then she stood and slowly strode towards Porthon, she stared down at him and whispered the words of healing, a sparkling aura settled down around him, healing his burns. He glared up at her, then quickly climbed to his feet, wincing at the soreness that Lera could not, or would not heal.
	
"Your brat will pay for this, mage. You just wait." With that, Porthon turned on his heel and stalked off, limping slightly.
	
Sighing softly, Lera turned back to Astraea and Feroth. Astraea had gotten Feroth to his feet and was helping to brush him off. She glanced over at Lera, and seeing the look on her mother's face, dropped her haze to the ground.
	
"I-I-I'm sorry, m-m-mother. He just-hit Feroth-" Astraea sniffled softly and rubbed the back of her hand over her eyes.
	
"I know, dear. I saw. I don't think there is anything he can or will do." She mentally added, I hope. Putting one arm around Astraea's shoulders and the other around Feroth's, she said, "Come, let us get home. You've both got lessons to do."

*	*	*	*

	
A week later, Astraea was brought before the Gray Council. Julask looked down at her with pity apparent in his features, Mith'ranir just scowled.
	
"You know what is to become of her, Lera. I told you when you asked for permission to keep her. She malevolently attacked one of us. She must die." Mith'ranir rasped hoarsely.
	
"My Lord, you don't understand! Porthon attacked Feroth, first! Astraea was only defending him!" Lera pleaded with him. "Please, my Lord. She was only doing what she felt was right! She was defending her friend, as any of us would have done!"

Mith'ranir glared down at her. "If she turned on one of us, she could turn on any of us! She's a menace! She must be killed! You know the conditions!"

Feroth leapt to his feet and and ran over to Astraea, pulling her against him protectively. "You cannot kill her! She is one of us as much as I am! If anyone should be killed, it's Porthon! He doesn't even possess magick, nor does he possess half a wit!"

            Astraea shook her head slowly and pushed Feroth gently away from her. "I'll take whatever punishment they see fit to give me. I'm not one of you, Feroth. I'm a San." She turned her gaze to Mith'ranir and raising her chin, said, "I'm ready to face my punishment."

Julask rose from his seat and stepped down to stand in front of Astraea. "It is my duty to dole out punishments. What you did, Astraea, was noble. It was what I would have done. You will not be killed, but rather, exiled. You cannot stay here, nor can you ever return."

Astraea bowed her head in acquiesce. She glances up at her mother and father, then looked at Feroth. A single tear rolled down her cheek as she kissed him lightly on the cheek, then fled from the Council chamber. 

She raced to her house, and began to throw things into her bag: her spellbooks, a few changes of clothes, a special stone that Feroth had given her, and the string of glittering blue beads her parents had given her on her tenth birthday. Turning and walking from her room, she paused only for a second, breathing in the fragrance of her home. Then, without looking back, she fled into the forest.

The Story of Heartfelt Loverdo
By Heartfelt Loverdo

(OOC note:  For those of you who have met Heartfelt, you know that she is extremely formal, polite, and shy.  She also shows very little emotion.  She does not speak of this openly, nor does she do so easily even when asked.  The story is told by Heartfelt herself. This story, I hope, will explain why.)

As with all stories, I will begin at the beginning, Sires and Mistresses.  Well...as far as I can remember.  Anyway....

It was the Day of Worship.  I was only six years old.  My mother awoke me, got me dressed, and headed me off towards the temple.  My town was a small town, near the borders of a Setite colony, named Bownya, on the northern boundary of Secia, which called itself Diamond Leaf.  It consisted mainly of five huts.  One, for my family, another for the Priestess and her family, one for food storage, one as a school, and the biggest one as a temple.  It was a forest village, so we did with what little we had.  Anyway, I remember asking my mother why she had brought me outside and why we were heading towards the temple, which children were forbidden to enter until the age of 14.  She said, if I remember correctly: 

"My dearest daughter.  Elindale is our beloved goddess.  She gives us this wonderful forest, our crops, and our dear friends, the animals.  You see, my love, she gives us nature.  She IS nature.  We must worship her every day, especially this day, or we face the loss of her love."

I, in my childish dumbness, asked my mother: "Why this day?"  She responded:

"Because, my dearest Heartfelt, this is the day that Elindale said that she, herself, would watch over us.  We love her deeply, and she loves us even more.  Why, maybe, someday, you, yourself, will become High Priestess of Elindale of this village, or in a big city, like Secia or the Spur."

My mother was always one for dreams and long speeches.  So, after that, I learned to keep most questions to myself. 

By the time my mother was finished with her speech about Elindale, we had just sat down in our temple.  It was small compared to the one in this city, but it was big enough to house our villagers.  Adults and children had gathered, and I was at awe on how much people could talk when everyone in the village knew everyone else.  I got caught up in all the excitement, and started to talk to a nearby child.  But as the High Priestess, Casine Evermore, approached and the crowd's voices came to an end, I caught on, and became quiet.  High Priestess Casine began the sermon while everyone listened intently to her.  All this, with all my childish impatience and energy, was very boring to me.  I focused my attention to a shadow lurking behind the crowd, near the door to the temple.  I asked my mom about it, but was hushed.  I asked again, and was gently slapped.  Soon, I began to cry and babble about the shadow.   As soon as it knew that it was seen, it took off.  Being that none of our males were properly equipped to fight, the shadow was left to go free.  Seems that the shadow was actually a thief from the Setite colony of Bownya.

I don't remember much from that point on until I was 13, when I was at my grandmothers, learning about  weaving, magick weaving, proper ways of worshipping Elindale, how to use herbs, which animals I could trust, which I couldn't, which plants were good to eat, which weren't, and perhaps the most important skill of my life, something that only I possess, as far as I know of, for it is a skill passed down through the
generations by only Diamond Leaf descendants.  It is called Substance Choreography.  I was working on getting the correct hand patterns to weave a small, healing bear, when, from the direction of my village, I heard screams, explosions, fire, and evil laughter.  My grandmother heard it too, and rose into the sky.  Diamond Leaf residents are not allowed to fly until 20 years of age.  My grandmother rose to about 60 feet above the forest canopy, and when she came down again, her face was struck with fear.  She picked me up (she was a very strong Secian for a woman of 56), and took of in the opposite direction of our village.
We ran for days, stopping only to eat and rest.  After three weeks, we arrived at an old shack, in the middle of the forest, four miles out of Secia's boundaries.  The shack's door was decorated with odd runes, which I knew were of Elindale's, though had no idea of their meaning.  As soon as my grandmother, had shut the door, she locked it, and dropped to her knees and prayed to Elindale.  It was there that we lived for two years, were the only thing I had for food was rodents, and the only thing I had for entertainment was my Choreography failures.   I failed many times, sometimes terribly, but it was often funny.  Seeing some of my soil characters, who were meant to cast a spell but do cartwheels instead was amusing at times.  The times there were tough, but me and my grandmother survived.  After two years, we headed back towards Diamond Leaf, and the travel back was much easier and comfortable than the first.

When we arrived at the clearing of Diamond Leaf, my grandmother and I dropped to the ground in utter shock and horror.  The Setite colony of Bownya had literally burned my village to the ground.  The only thing that was left was the tree stump alter of which we worshipped Elindale.  My grandmother began praying, and though I did not know what she was praying for, I joined her.  And, as if answering our prayer, a holy presence appeared.  It was weak for me, but it was obviously much stronger for my grandmother, for she rushed over to the stump, which was now glowing slightly, and kissed it.  She then beckoned that I follow suit, which I did.  After the presence vanished, my grandmother and I fell and cried.  I was only 15 at the time.  I admit now that I am not sure if the Setite colony of Bownya was actually a Setite colony, for I never asked.  I merely heard of a conversation of the colony and of Bownya and of the shadow in the temple those many years ago.

Five months afterwards, Grandmother and I arrived at Secia. Grandmother had taken all the money that was in the shack of which we escaped too, for apparently that was the treasure house where our village stored what little money it had.  It had saved up quite an amount.  140 gold, I believe it was(This was before the currency of gold became more expensive, when the silver equivalent of gold was 25).  My grandmother bought a small shack, with one bedroom, and a living room for four gold, though, even at that age, I knew we could have bought something more nicer than a shack.  And it was the day after we had bought the shack, when, looking in the direction of the sea, I saw a ship.  I asked my grandmother about it, and she told me it was a ship that carried passengers from Secia to the Spur.  I swore to myself that I would someday be aboard that ship, bound straight for the Spur.  'Twas many years later, when that vow was completed.
My Grandmother had gotten ill, thus I had to work for a living.  I didn't know why, but Grandmother refused to let us use the money from my town, and refused to tell me where she had hidden it.  I was reduced to begging, which, with my limited skills in Choreography, proved as successful as a 17 old could be without thievery.  One day, after buying a loaf of bread for the 15 silver I had earned, I went home, saw my grandmother sleeping peacefully, put the loaf of bread next to her bed, and snuck of towards the dock.  I needed to know how much I should raise in order to have enough to buy a ticket.  I asked the dock clerk and got the response:

"Two gold, sweet cheeks."

I was heart broken.  Never, in the five months that I had be begging, had I even came close to saving more than 20 silver, much less 50.  I looked at the ship.  Its' big, wooden frame stood majestically over the water.  Hundreds of people scurried like rodents onto the huge body.  I asked how long until the next ship came, and got the answer:

"Two years, cutey pie."

I vowed that I'd have saved up 50 silver and enough to survive by the time the next ship came into dock.  I hurried off back home, where I found the loaf half eaten, and my Grandmother awake, praying to Elindale.  I told her that she had to sleep, but she said:

"Heartfelt, my child, you must leave me.  I am dying.  Elindale, herself, has told me that it is so.  The money is underneath your bed, in a compartment.  Use it to leave Secia and go to the Spur.  From there on, use it widely.  Always be as polite as you can at the Spur.  Though it can give you many rewards, if you are not careful, it can be your final resting place.  I am old, and without a Dragon.  I cannot explain the need for a Dragon, but the Spurian citizens will have scrolls written about it.  Go now, my beloved, and may Elindale protect you from all dangers."

After she had said the last sentence, her eyes became blank, her face lifeless.  I cried, there, on her lifeless body, though not long.  I got up, got the money, and hurried to the docks.  Luckily, I was in time.  I paid the 50 silver fee, and got aboard.  I had only my money, my tattered and torn leaf dress, and my courage.  Thus, began my trip to the Spur.

Now, my trip to the Spur was a peaceful one, calm weather the entire voyage, which is strange since the trip took one year.  I later heard that on its way back, the ship sunk due to a storm.  Anyway, the one day that I still have nightmares about was, ironically, on my town's Day of Worship.  I don't know if I was suppose to take it as a warning of harsh reality to come or as a punishment for what crime I do not know of.  But, I was alone in my small room, when a knock came to my door.  I opened it, and saw the cabin boy, of who's name I do not remember.  I noticed that he was drunk, so I invited him in happily, and offered him a seat.  We talked for awhile, though, with the smell of rotgut, he was not attractive, nor good company.  He was a Go-blin-al, I believe, and his odd features made it no easier to get comfortable.  I was just about to ask him to leave when he suddenly grabbed me by the arms, and grinned an evil and toothy grin.  I asked him what was he doing and for him to let me go.  He responded to neither of them.  What followed is rather gruesome, but had it not be stopped by the cook, who, thank Elindale, heard my cries for help from below, in the galley, I would have most likely been impregnated by the cabin boy.  I broke down into hysterical cries.  Why did Elindale let this happen to me? was the only thought in my head as I sat there an cried.  I spent the rest of my voyage in that room.

It was the day of docking, and was the only day since my rape that I had come out in broad daylight.  The plank was lowered, and the people scurried off.  I followed them, but was stopped by a cloaked figure.  This figure asked me if I would like to go to a place called 'The Training Grounds'.  I politely refused, and began to leave.  I thought he was some Taathian or Setite trying to trick me into sacrificing myself, so when he asked if I was sure, I rudely said no and told him to leave me alone.  I was only 21 at the time, so I was still, mind wise, an adolescent.  He cursed me and, praying loudly to Taath, pointed at me.  It did not hurt, though I felt my body age.  The cloaked figure said:

"Now you have been aged two years, rude one.  May the age give you wisdom, and may you NEVER be rude to me, or those like me, again.  Or, you WILL face death."

I took his threat seriously, and, for the first time in my entire life, flew.  My wings were new at this, so they only carried me halfway to the Spur's gate.  The rest of the way I walked.

Thus, ends my story Sires and Mistresses.  <Heartfelt curtsies to all the readers and flies off>

It seems Sordum Corinth is holding the #1 spot of the Psion Guild well, with a couple close behind. Although the majority of the Guild is composed of Psycians, we can see that Mestoffa and Rrylar are well up there. Three members of the ever elusive Sa'kar family show up on the rankings as well, Merlas being the highest of them all at #5.

Now let us move on to the Thieves' Guild.

It would seem that the #1 spot here is being struggled for, as yours truly holds it at the moment with Changeman in hot pursuit. Laeta Silkspinner made her return to Spur apparent as she flew up the rankings to #3, with many other familiar faces behind. Many of the members here are not seen very often, but that's just the way of those of the shadows...

That's it for this months Rise of the Classes folks. Remember, keep your eyes peeled for more ROTC and new Top 5's next month!

Fearagoh
