iting down my view on the matter of Chaos, Order and Entropy.

What are the definitions of Order, Chaos and Entropy:

You have to start with Order since definitions for Chaos seem to always say disorder.

Greetings, Spurians, and merry Rinannimas!

It's that time of year again, and the merrymakers of Spur seem to be coming out in force.  True, this merriment seems to include a lot of folks getting their jollies by causing widespread chaos and massive slaughter, but it's the holidays and anything goes.  Unfortunately our society column this issue is missing, as the columnist is on vacation somewhere, and probably up to his chin in a snowdrift.  What, me, wish?  Anyway, here's hoping that this issue will serve to relieve some of the stress we all feel around this season.  So curl up with a copy, pour yourself a mug of "sparkling sparkling cider" (you'll never get the in-jokes if you don't come to the recitals...), and enjoy.  Have a safe and joyous Rinannimas, and may the year to come be filled with happiness and possibility for you and yours.

Bronze 2
By Rhea Romero

Inzy the Usil thief was happy when she knew what was going on.  She wasn't happy now.

The quiet, plain-looking Hithual who had recruited her for no discernible reason was leading her towards the suburbs.  Of course, there was no way of getting INTO the suburbs, but Inzy didn't bother mentioning that.

Inzy would have turned around and run away right then, but she knew the matter of the Hithual would have bugged her for a long time.  Who was he and what was that mission he was on?  And while we're asking questions, what was his name?  She asked the last out loud.

"Lobb," he replied.  Oh, pretty, Inzy thought.  On the other hand, who'm I to talk?  She often thought that if she had been named Ella or Gwen or something respectable like that, she would never have turned to Set and become a thief.

Lobb stopped at the gate to the suburbs and paused thoughtfully.  Inzy sighed.  "Listen, Lobb, I'm quite glad to help you out on your mission here, but what IS it exactly?"

The Hithual glanced at her and gestured downwards. Inzy blinked, gave a soft "ah," and crouched down to his eye level.  Lobb raised an eyebrow at her.

"What do you know about the subconscious mind," he said.

Inzy narrowed her eyes.  "The part of the brain that works without being regulated by the awareness of an individual."

"That was a rhetorical question."  He frowned.

"Well, I AM an Usil Elf," she said.  He frowned again and she shut up.

"Listen.  I got a mission.  Sometime during this mission, a spell was cast on me making me forget my purpose."  Inzy raised her eyebrows pathetically at him.  "All I have is this," Lobb raised a small bronze medallion he wore on a silk cord, "to hint at what I'm doing.

"So:  I'm following my instincts."  Lobb leaned forward.  NOW he talks, Inzy thought.  "I've forgotten my mission, but it's still there -- in my subconscious mind."  Lobb tapped his temple.

Inzy glanced towards the gate.  "Seems dangerously random to me."  She nervously smoothed her blue satin dress.

Lobb followed her gaze to the gate and smiled suddenly.  "Not going there," he said in his usual spare tone.  He abruptly turned towards the wall of a nearby building and kicked it three times.  A trapdoor in the ground was pushed open and a Flerian popped his head out.  "Yeah, come down," he said and disappeared.

Inzy stared.

Lobb tapped his temple.  "The subconscious mind, Usilin."  He climbed down the hole.

Glory
By Guztymne RHorawytzR

Scryn fell into a dream-like trance.  She had moments like these as a child, but had experienced none since she devoted her life to Set.  It was a violent flashing of different images, most of them from the past, some of them of the future.  She shivered as she tried to pull herself from the cold floor of the temple, but nothing worked.  She was trapped to experience the prophesy of the future.  She had no wish to.  It had caused so much pain before- why again?  Then, a calming darkness.  A warm hand reached out to her waist, lifted her, and brought her to the warm bosom of Set.  There was only peace in Scryn's mind.  She could hear Set's voice pulsing quieting in her mind-  My child, I am here- do not be afraid.  It was I who bestowed the gift of prophesy on you.  I will never harm you, and will never let you see what you need not see.  Now, go do what you have to do, child.

Scryn woke to the invigorating caress of a cold towel on her forehead.  Set had spoken to her- had given meaning to her life.  Now, this prophesy... Scryn could feel the meaning of the prophesy on her tongue, but could not put it into coherent thought.  She looked around and saw the priest of the temple attend to her chaotic mind.  He uttered a phrase or two, and touched her forehead.  Her pulsing headache subsided.  "No wonder I'm not the high priest!" Scryn thought to herself.  

"I feel Set's presence in you.  The town inn is just a little west of the town square.  Just go east of this temple, and continue on the dirt road, and you'll come across your destiny,"  he said, with a twinkle in his eyes.

Scryn started on her short journey to the local inn, and she thought of how she got herself into this Setite mess.  Her parents were thieves.  When she got her seizures in the night, it was only natural for them to take her to the Setite temple to get her head checked.  Turns out that Set had chosen her to take the vocation and that was the only way to save her life.  Her parents wept over the loss of their only daughter.  Deep inside, she was grateful to her parents for giving her a new life and sacrificing her so as to give her new life.  She grew and trained in the Setite path.  Her headaches and nightmares lessened, and with time, disappeared altogether.  She healed so well that she could pursue her Psycian tradition of psionics.  She trained hard and persevered in the art of Set.  She went around her home village and healed all she met.  It seemed that she met almost every townsman except her parents.  Deep inside, she could feel her love for them enduring the trials of everyday life, but she carried on with her mission as a cleric of Set.

One day, without warning, the city was invaded by some Dragon's diabolic plan.  Still, Scryn carried on with her devotion to Set as she had every other day.  It just seemed that there were more wounded casualty with each day.  About a month later, her high priestess sent her on a trip to a neighboring village to give tithes to Set in their temple- something about tradition.  The high priestess never said.  So she made her way to the foreign temple and kneeled in front of her god in sign of reverence- and then the trance permeated her body like a fog.  Then...

She made her way to the town square when she felt a tug in her pursestrings!  She swerved around only to see a thief make his way into the shadows.  She whined and ran after him, weaving a sleep rune in the air.  Before the runes could hit the insolent thief, he was already down and unconscious.  She gasped and laid her hands on him, healing him back to perfect health.  She glanced up at the towering figure before her, and fell into another trance.

This time, she could see herself, but her body was not hers to control.  She started uttering words and recalling facts that she had no idea about.

"Fixen.  Be at peace and know that this is Set.  The Gods have chosen you- the humblest of the nobles to challenge the infidel Dragon Liurz.  This has attempted raids on our holy temples and for that, you are to be our punishing wrath.  You will be granted victory, and your name will be known throughout the land."

Scryn looked up at the building of a Thugian before her.  She could not tell his expression because the sun was in her eyes, but she could feel his acquiescence.  He took her by the hand and led her out of the pathway to the inn where they could chat.

That evening, she had a ball.  Though Fixen was not a well educated man, she found his simple outlook at life all the more enchanting.  It was as if all the universe began to make sense with his presence.  But her mind prophetically realized that they couldn't be together.  They were entirely different- he was walking brawn while she was a mind-controlling cleric.  He was inarticulate while she was a chatterbox at times.  Furthermore, his name would be known across the land...

Fixen agreed to face Liurz in combat.  Together, Scryn and he made their way to her hometown where Liurz had recently invaded.  Fixen was not a very handsome Thugian though his arms were big, even for that of his race.  He had a habit of twitching his eyebrows when someone said something that he did not understand- that is probably what she loved most about him.  But when he was with her, it was as if he understood everything she said, more so than those around her.  She knew that this was not love- how could one fall in love in less than a moon's time?

Soon, they reached the outskirts of the city.  Already, they could see the damage the Dragon had laid to waste in the town.  They made their way to the center of the town where a great tower grew to the sky, as the Dragon had forced his slaves to build.  What if the voice was wrong?  What if Fixen died...  She shrugged her doubt away and said a quick prayer to Set.  She set up a small altar at the entrance of the tower and sacrificed some fresh animals to Set for good luck.  A protective aura rose around Fixen and her as they made their way up the tower.

Fixen touched Scryn's glowing head.  He touched her gently on her forehead and smiled in the darkness of the tower.  He mumbled a few words in Thugian that Scryn could guess the meanings to.  She smiled and mumbled back, "I won't forget you too."  Did Fixen feel her pain and fears, mixed with doubt and anticipation?  She followed the giant footsteps of Fixen as their every noise echoed in the hollow of the tower.  Scryn closed her eyes and instantly, she could feel an exterior presence.  A deep red pair of eyes gazed into her mind and she screamed.  Fixen caught her before she fell backwards onto the stairways.  She gasped.

"He's here- I can detect his presence," she muttered.  With his left hand, Fixen held his warhammer close to his chest as he carried Scryn in his right arm.  His warhammer was glowing rusty with Set's power.  Though Scryn felt safe with Set's protection, she shivered in Fixen's tight embrace as she could feel his destiny gloriously unfurling.  Soon, they ended at the roof of the tower, a trapdoor traced dustily above them.  Scryn detected no traps, and Fixen bashed the trapdoor open.  Before they had surfaced to the dark sky, Scryn knew that Liurz was there.  When Fixen lifted her to the ground above them, Scryn saw a monstrous beast above her and shrieked.  The Dragon circled the tower and seeing her, landed with an earthquake.  Fixen roared and shielded Scryn and himself.  The Dragon's frosty breath hit the shield, but Fixen's warrior skills protected them- for the time being.  Scryn tried to penetrate the thick hide of the Dragon's skull to weaken him, but all she got in response was a demented laugh from Liurz.

"Trying to play with my mind?"  Liurz thundered.  With his claws, he tore Fixen's shield into two.  Fixen, surprised by the ordeal, lunged at him and struck his shin with the warhammer.  With a single blow, the bones in his leg shattered, and the Dragon fell onto the floor.  His claws reached for Fixen who raised his eyes only to gasp at the bloody claws inches from his neck.  Scryn shrieked and raised her arms to the sky.  A rusty vulture encircled Fixen and the claws went through his body, doing no damage.

The Dragon grew furious at the failure and raised his clawed arms to the sky, invoking the wrath of nature to strike at Fixen.  Lighting formed a glowing sphere and was about to strike Fixen.  The poor Thugian was helpless to all this magick around him.  He could only strike Liurz again.  Scryn closed her eyes and cast a anti-magick shell around Fixen, and the sphere diffused into glittering dust.

By now, Liurz was smashed endlessly by Fixen's god-blessed power.  With his last breath, Liurz swept his tail at Fixen, throwing him off the tower.  Scryn screamed at the possibility of his death and clenched her eyes, creating a single blanket of air with her psionics to break his fall.  She did not feel Liurz's claws tearing her spine as her entire spirit concentrated on Fixen.  As she laid gasping for air over the tower, she saw Fixen standing at the bottom, looking back at her.

On Growing Old, Losing Memory, and Getting Lazy and Fat
By Hecat Mclion

This is HeCat Mclion.  Um, this entire thing is about Leuians, laziness, stubbornness, children, The Pride, Spur, being a fighter, being lazy, being confused, not knowing who anyone is anymore, being beat up by people you consider newbies, and other fun stuff like that. 
	
Oh, I'm also going to throw in some stuff about myself in the process. On with the story I suppose.  Well, maybe this is an autobiography...

My real name is Alps, Hecat is just a nickname of sorts.  Don't ask how I got it. Alps was the name of my father.  So I guess I'm Alps Jr.  My mother's name was Leandra.  It's very unlikely any of you knew either of them.  Although a few may have seen Alps (my father, not myself) when he first entered Spur.  
	
My mother was a Rinnannian Heart Cleric.  My Father, a Odarian Sword Cleric. All I know about my mother I heard from my Father.  My mother died giving birth to me. 	
	
During my youth my father and I roamed the world.  Exploring, discovering, learning, and meeting new people.  One day we happened upon a small secian that was in the forest.  The Secian was sick, wet, cold, and shivering.  My father quickly wrapped him in blanket and began to cast comfort auras on him. 	
	
The next morning when I awoke I saw my father sitting next to the secian who was apparently feeling quite a bit better.  As I came over the secian looked at me then at my father.  My father smiled and told the secian that I was his son.  The secian giggled and flew over and hugged me.  He introduced himself as Pettewe and said that he was grateful for my father taking care of him.  He said that a strange plague had killed most of the people in the village he lived.  He said he was afraid of getting sick so he left.  	
	
Pettewe, my father, and I spent the rest of the day talking.  Pettewe asked if he could come with us and we agreed.  My father was more then happy to have a secian along. 	
	
Over several more years of traveling Pettewe grew very close to us.  He was like a brother to me.  Which may explain why I tend to talk and/or act like a secian at times. ;-)
	
One day we were walking through some grasslands and my father saw a small, town in the distance.  We decided to head to the town as we were in need of supplies and the like.  Once inside this small fortress town, which we came to know the name of it was Meetpoint, we had dinner at the local tavern.  The wine there was a bit watered down much to my father's disappointment.  We then got a room at the inn for the night and took our rest.
	
The next day my father asked me what I thought about getting a permanent home.  He said that he was getting a little too old for the life of a nomad.  I didn't really know what to say about that.  I had never really had many friends, cept for Pettewe, but said I really wouldn't mind having some.  He smiled at me and told me that he'd heard about there being a Pride in the city to the north and that it was past time for me to be Kitra'd.  I had been taught much about the Pride by my father.  I was eager to be Kitra'd.
	
Later, my father said that he was going to try to find out about Spur and the Leuians there.  He told Pettewe and I to stay in Meetpoint until his return and that he'd be back in no later then a day.  	
	
Two days passed and my father still hadn't arrived.  Pettewe and I were getting worried.  We went into this city in search of my father and did not find him.  We asked many people if they had seen Alps, my father.  No one had seen him.  To this day I don't know what happened.	
	
Pettewe was very uncomfortable in this town and told me there was too much violence here.  He said that he was going to go find a small village and settle down.  He said he'd come and visit me from time to time and he has.	
	
Alone in Spur without friends, I began to explore this strangely arranged town.  I believe one of the first friends I met in Spur was a fir elf (?) named Soraya.  He helped me quite a bit.  Showed me around, hunted with me, etc.  Of course, there were other people that helped me.  A Leuian by the name of Aquatic introduced me to Shinto 'cause I was inquiring about the Pride.  I was injured at the time from a recent hunt and Shinto told me to sit and tried to heal me.  I still remember his exact words after several attempts at this.  "You're difficult to heal, Brother," is what I believe he said.  It was uh.. Funny at the time.  
	
I was introduced to many other Leuians for the first time in my first days in Spur.  Paratwa took me and a friend of mine hunting in the southlands when I was by no means ready for that.  We were attacked by Rijoms, fire ants, and all types of horrible things from there.  Even Paratwa was killed at that time.	 That was more frighting then funny, however.  I believe Paratwa took me to the Skeleton closet where I met Skratchnar and Caspian for the first time.  The skeleton closet was a MUCH better place for me to be at the time.  ::begins to slip into thinking about when hammers were worth 1k and sighs::	
	
Well, not all the people I came to know in my early and not so early days were particular pleasant to me.  I don't believe I was ever killed by someone, however.  I remember I, somehow, annoyed this Arachnian, Ttrrachkkchrrkk to the point that I was fairly sure he was going to get into selling khat fur (mine) and using my tail as a bookmark.  The thing is, I didn't do this on purpose nor did I know what I got him so upset over.  Oh well, can't be friends with everyone.
	
Well, quite some time later I met my khat'sara, GoldenRay.  I think she was well, sorta dead when I met her.  There wasn't a rezzer in the realms that day.  I waited and waited with GoldenRay for a rezzer.  It was about an hour before one finally came.  After she was rezzed she thanked me for staying with her and we spent most of the day together getting to know one another.  I think it was two days after we met that I asked her to be my khat'sara.  I gave her an emerald amulet that my father gave me thus starting the "One Moon."  	
	
GoldenRay and I hunted together alot and spend time um... looking at flowers in Rinanni's Garden.  Soon, we had a daughter.  GoldenRay named her Limitrel.  Limi has always been a grunt like me.  Limi also decided that she would follow Elindale, a first for someone in the McLion family.  We've all been a bunch of Odarians and Rinannians.  Now, we got one tree-hugger.  	
	
Kids grow up so quick, Leuians in particular.  Limi was khat'sara'd to Asland at the age of Um. 1? Don't you go and say something like, "What kind of father are you?!?"  cause Limi was very mature for her age!  
	
Well, time passed, many things changed.  Many people have come and gone.  GoldenRay no longer comes to Spur 'cause she cannot afford to pay the taxes.  Limitrel only comes very rarely.  I haven't seen Asland in a long while, but life goes on.  
	
When I was a young khat I wasn't very lazy at all, I always was trying to improve my skills and working hard.  Now, I'm an old, lazy khat that has just finished writing his autobiography.  I know that many more changes will effect the future citizens of Spur.  Some will seem as if they have ruined your life; some, as if it's made it heaven.  There's just three things to remember when something happens that makes you feel as if tomorrow's not worth living.  They are: Be strong, don't give up, and you'll get used to it.  Oh, one more thing.  When a muat offers you some ale he brewed himself, don't drink it.

The Journal Of A Leuian
By Flask Argivian

July 23, 165-
	
Today is my fifth Birthday and I am to be ordained into the Temple of Odarous. My father and mother are both Rinnanians but I chose to be Odarian. This day is against my father's wish, though my mother tells me that I can choose any religion I wish.
	
I'm back from my ordaining. I only wish my father was their to see it. He had gotten mad and ran off in the middle of the ceremony. He looked very angry when I showed him my new shapes and runes that the church applied to me on that day, so angrily that he stormed out into the night...

July 24, 165-
	
My father still hasn't come back from last night. I won't cry as my mother did, my father taught me that crying doesn't help anything, anyhow I was more angry then sad. I thought to myself that he was selfish and wasn't acting like the Rinnanian he was supposed to act like, he made my mother cry. That made me mad most of all, besides the fact that my mother and I weren't hunters like he. He supported the family with food and money.
	
My father is still not back and its getting late. I'm thinking that he might not come back at all, what will my mother and I do for food tonight. I'm outside now laying on the grass looking out onto the plains waiting for my father to ride up on his horse but sadly he doesn't seem to come whenever I pray to Odarous.
	
Later in the night a tall Leuian man came up to the den, he requested my mother. I stood beside my mother the whole time the man was at the den entrance. "Your husband has joined the mercenaries guild he is awaiting his first assignment as we speak, he has requested that I teach your son to hunt until he returns" the man exclaimed to my mother. Then my mother burst into to tears...

August 5, 165-
	
Today is the first day that the man will teach me to hunt. "My name is Arthlex, your father and I are good friends" Arthlex said to me. Arthlex was a sword cleric just as my father was. Then he taught me to use his sword and we successfully killed a young pig. My mom was very proud of me.
	
My mother finished cooking the pig and asked Arthlex to stay for dinner, but he shook his head and left to his home. After dinner I wondered what my father was doing. I hoped he was making lots of money and buying gifts for my mother and I. Then I thought that something bad might have happened to him...

March 21, 171-
	
Today is the final day that Arthlex will teach me. In the mourning he and I went to the Temple of Odarous. Their, Arthlex handed me a sack of coins and told me to offer it to Odarous. I lifted the sack towards the altar and proclaimed, "Odarous please accept my humble offering". The sack in my hands slowly vanished in a flash of bright light. A shadowy figure from the corner of the temple approached us. The figure had something in his hands. He lifted the object toward the altar and muttered a phrase in secti. The Object began to shimmer and I began to identify the object as a bastard sword. The sword was so bright covered my eyes looked away, by then the sword had stopped glowing and I looked back to the shadowy man. He raised the sword above my head, blade in one hand and handle in the other. The sword began to glow again, he lowered the sword and placed it into my hands. The glow disappeared but I felt it travel through my body. The shadowy man retreated back into the corner.
	
On the way back to the den, I asked Arthlex why did that man do that. Arthlex explained to me, "He has Ordained you into a full sword cleric". I stopped for a second and ran my new bastard-sword across my finger. I cut myself,  I sat down and laid my hands on my chest and prayed a moment. I looked at my finger and notice a small glow come from the cut...

March 22, 171-
	
I woke up this morning very early. I went out to hunt in deep in the forest west of the den. I slayed two large pigs and brought them home. I told my mother that I would go to the plains and hunt their for three days. On my way out I was surprised to meet Arthlex on the way out. He looked sad. Just then I had a horrible feeling from in my stomach...

March 22, 172-
	
Its been exactly one year since the death of my father. That day in 171 I cried, then after that day I never cared about what my father had taught me. It was his own fault that he died. I actually despised him then, he was ignorant and stubborn. He was more like a Taathian rather then a Rinannian...

July 23, 175-
	
Today is my fifteenth birthday. My mother wants to send me to the Training Grounds to learn more about being a sword cleric. I shook my head and said, "Who will support you". She replied, "Arthlex has always been their for me". She then closed the discussion before I could talk back. That night I went to visit Arthlex at his home. I told him that my mother was sending me to the TG. He agreed with her. "The training grounds is a good place to learn and train to become a priest", He said.
	
I went home and decided to go to the TG. I packed up and readied myself to leave...

July 24, 176-
	
I woke up and walked out the den. My mother rushed to me before I left and she presented me with my father's leather mail. It was tattered and ready to break, but it was my only memory of my father. I kissed my mother and gave her a big hug. Then I left toward the plains...

September 16, 182-
	
My training is finished and I am ready to leave the training grounds, then finally go home. I couldn't wait. I thought how happy my mother would be once I got home. I thought how proud Arthlex would be of me.
	
I looked across the plains and I could barely make out my den, it was a days walk away. I set a fire and slept right away, because I couldn't wait to get home...

September 17, 182-
	
I approached my den and saw the most horrid thing I had ever thought would happen. The den had been attacked and burnt down. I fell to my knees and sobbed...

Flesh's Story
By Flesh Bonne

It all started in TG where I was born.  I had no knowledge of my father or mother.  It was said that my parents were killed in the Arachnian vs Dragon wars.  Despite my tragic loss, I had a hard time trying to get my skills up to par in the training grounds.  With non-rechargeable webs, it was tough to level in the skill.  No doubt I keep at it along with other skills to become the best that I could possible be.  I had many friends on my long, hard journey.  But not many of my race were around at the time.  Also the fact that I couldn't speak common language like the rest of society, I felt left out of things.  When people went hunting, I would try to ask to come along with the party, they simply ignored my attempt to make peace with other races.  With that I turned to the thievish life, picking other peoples pockets for some quick, fast money, also for revenge.  People hated me for this so I just stayed away for a while till things blew over, working on all my skills to get them the best that they can be, then left TG to the wonderful land of Spur.  When I arrived through the archway, I felt a chill going down my spine.  Seeing a lot of people standing in the Meetpoint of Spur, Town Square.  Everyone looked at me like I was crazy and laughed at me because I was new to the land.  I was a little upset but understood their actions against a newbie thief.  Especially because I was a thief, I felt I needed to watch my back out of PB because people might try to kill me just for living as a thief.  I had the mark of Set, my God, and that made everyone mad at me.  I did however meet up with a fellow Arachnian.  He taught me everything I needed to know about life in Spur.  We worked together got hours a day working up skills.  I, wanting to be able to protect myself when attacked, worked mostly on Sharp Weapons.  My friend mostly worked on the art of Shield Parry.  I was amazed at this skill because when you get really high skill level with it, it blocks all of peoples attacks against you, with the exception of martial arts.  He also was of Set and we went to the temple occasionally to donate to our God, Set.  We were very loyal and well rounded.  In time, I made more out-of-race friends like Leuians and Dragons.  I meet one dragon that liked me alot for some reason and made me his cousin.  I thought this was really great seeing how I didn't grow up with my mother or father.  Also, I meet a very rich Arachnian.  He had it made, all the fancy items and mail with matching swords.  I thought maybe if I just asked him for a little bit of money, he wont mind.  With that, I went to him and asked him for a mere 5k.  He turned to me and said "Here's 50k, go buy yourself some new armor.  I was so happy that I had alot of money and was also at the same time surprised at him.  But, being the one to not ask any questions when given something, took the money and got some new shining armor from the AG.  This armor was good because it blocked all of Skeletons attacks.  So, I hunted skellies for a while making good money while the gettin  was good.  Then I saw the rich Arachnian again with this blood-stained bone blade.  I swooned at this and asked him how much would he sell it to me for.  He pondered for just a moment and then said he will let only me have it for the low price of 200k.  I shrieked at the words of this man.  I didn't know there was that much money in the world at that time. So I asked him where do I make a large amount of money in a short time.  He responded with Wretches.  I  blinked and asked him to repeat what he had said.  He disregarded it and said they were too hard for me to hunt at such a young age.  He recommended hunting rogues and assassins.  That sounded more appealing to me and with that, I was off to hunt rogues and assassins for 200k.  This took more that 1 month of hard work and labor.  But I finally did it.  I went to him again hoping that he hadnt sold the sword to anyone else while I was making money.  I was happy when we waved it at me so I gave him the 200k in cash and he gave me the blade.  I was so happy with my new sword that I rejoiced for the whole day showing all my friends.  I loved that weapon because it had matched my last name. Later on, I got a tattoo of my beloved sword on my right arm.  I showed everyone my tattoo and they got jealous.  They tried to fight me because I was boosting to much, but fought them off with my blade and good shield.  I found out later it was all a joke and we became friend.  This is how I made more friends.  I was broke since I just got a new sword fer a lot of money, so , I decided to hunt.  But, I didn't know what to hunt for alot of money.  I asked someone where should I hunt for good money.  He told me that traders was his fav spot to hunt in.  I took his advise and went to the Arena, waited for some traders to pop out and I killed them.  I would do this everyday and made alot of money doing so because they gave really good money.  Until one day, someone named Reywind came to the Arena where I was hunting.  I thought he wanted to hunt with me so I greeted him and keep on killing traders and nobles.  The then tackled me, and started casting magick at me.  He had some of the most dreadful spells like acid web and Lightning Storm.  He didn't get very successful the first few tries he casted but he did get lucky the next time.  He got me with a spell that hit for 50 the first time, then pulsed even 5 seconds or so for 30 points.  I got up and ran to TS and got the spell dispelled by a mage.  Reywind came to lok for me but I had to give in because he would have killed me like he almost did.  He was said to be the protector of townies or something and will lose his life fighting townie killers if he had to.  I thought he was crazy but then said forget it and didn't go back to the Arena again(for a while).

          After a while, I heard about something called "Games."  Someone told me about them and said you get paid for fighting people.  I thought this was gonna be cool so he told me to come to TS on Saturday nights.  I did so and had to pay an entrance fee to the mighty elder Vernox.  I didn't mind it because I was gonna have fun killing people.  Then I cast a gaze across the Green Room looking at all those Nobles that I couldnt even hit .  I became scared knowing that I wasnt even a fighter.I didnt want to lose skill so I wanted to leave.  But the elder told me I didnt have to depart and that he would give me a free rezz if I died.  I was happy and thought I had nothing to lose and I should play in the games even if I was killed.   I got lucky enough to be on Kryger's team that night and he got most of the kills for our team.  The elder called everyone to the center room to fight and to be in the center rank only.  I was luckily still alive until a second stage dragon came out of  nowhere and hit me with his deadly claws, hitting me for 40 each hit.  We thieves don't get as much HP as most people so we die fast kind of.  I tried to sit to be healed but I bleed to death.  After that I just watched Kryger kill the rest of the other team and we all got rezzed and paid for our team being the winner of the games.  I got a whooping 20k just for dying.  I wished that games took place every night!  I ran to the bank and quickly deposited my money.  I was thinking , I could people after they came through the portal.  I tried once but failed.  I decided not to try again because people would see me and kill me.  After that, someone told me hat something called "peddles" came every Thursday and they have auctions.  I got happy and came on that day to see what was up for sale.  A lot of people were there that night waiting for the bidding to start.  I had about 200k coming to the tent where it was held.  I thought that was plenty to get something really good like some well protecting armor or a nice outfit.  Rehas pulled out some of the best armors and mails I have seen in my young life.  bidding usually started at 100k.  I was comfortable and confident of my bidding so I bid 120k.  Then people kept raising over me until it went well over  200k and I was out of it because I didn't have enough money to go any higher.   I wondered where they got all that money from .  a man named ARRRG bid 1.2 million silver for a golden spiked diamond maul.  I thought it was crazy to have to pay so much for a weapon.  I was mad that I didn't even get to get anything that night .  I also saw many people with new weapons and armor the next day and I had nothing.  I thought there was no way for me to make that much money to bid with the "high rollers".  I was very mad and decided to spend all my time working my my weapons and parry skills so I work my way up to fighting enemies that give more money.

Charlette's Take on Chaos, Order, and Entropy in Spur
By Charlette Poisonsilk

When I was young to spur I had few run ins with people who considered my actions not becoming of a Chaotic.  This weighed heavy on my mind and it took me awhile to sort out all my thoughts on the matter.  I am Chaotic but I am not what they considered Chaotic.  I do not like to throw things around pell mell.  I am not an unpredictable lunatic that you had no idea, as you greeted me if I would greet you back or swing at you.
 
So either they are wrong or I am wrong and as any self respecting Chaotic would do I decided they were wrong.  After many months of deep thought I finally worked out exactly what I considered Chaotic.
  
And then I heard a comment recently that Taath's temple was the most organized and this was considered odd.
  
It didn't seem odd to me at all.  If someone is Chaotic it doesn't mean that their bed room is going to be a mess.  It's just their view of life.  This spurred me into writing down my view on the matter of Chaos, Order and Entropy.

What are the definitions of Order, Chaos and Entropy:

You have to start with Order since definitions for Chaos seem to always say disorder.
Order - A condition of methodical or prescribed arrangement among component parts such that proper functioning or appearance is achieved
Chaos - A condition of or place of great disorder or confusion
Entropy - A hypothetical tendency for all matter and energy in the universe to evolve toward a state of inert uniformity-SNORE!

What do these definitions mean to the people of spur?  Nothing.  They have nothing at all to do with the people of spur, except for the underlying intent of each word.
 
What I decided that Chaos, Order and Entropy mean:
To me Order is people gathering together and doing things for the better of the community as a whole.  Because of that they are sticklers for making and following rules.

Chaos is people gathering together to benefit themselves and those close to them.  They will do more the ends justify the means to get what they want.

Entropy is a tough one.  The closest I can get to understanding this is Anarchy.  Now anarchy is not necessarily bad.  It just means there is no government.  If all the people under this are good then it works well.  However if you have a couple of bad ones they can cause major problems, because there is no mechanism for handling them.

Broken
By Karne Fireblade

Frozen like a winter night,
Dark and shadowed, without light,
Hope is gone, hope is lost,
Love is given, at deadly cost,

Dreams continue, refusing to die,
Though the mind knows that it's a lie,
The heart knows nothing, the heart knows naught,
For even in heartbreak, it has fought,

Fought to live, fought to die,
Fighting dreams that are a lie,
Attempting to push back hope,
Unwilling to continue, unable to cope,

With the pain that it's suffered, for so long,
So it will do anything, right or wrong,
If it meant it could again find love,
The feeling of a star, a light, a dove,

Whose gentle touch reigns, like a fire in night,
Shining so brilliantly, with its warming light,
But woe for the heart which cannot find,
Who has lost all sense, all calm of mind,

For that soul goes loveless, battered, alone,
Careless, bitter, chilled to the bone,
All this heartbreak, all this pain,
Which now controls me, which now reigns,
Came from tragedy, came from hope,
Came from love at the end of its rope,

Love still burns within a soul,
But without another, the heart turns to coal,
Blackened, shattered, pressed, and cold,
Given away, laughed at and sold,

Hope gone, hope lost,
All at, great cost,
For now the soul lies shattered and torn,
Bitter cold, old and worn,
Unloved, shattered,
Broken... and battered.============================================================================

The Singular Rearing of Jimnoodle Scurlinut
By Jimnoodle Scurlinut

Dis be the story of how I ended up going through the golden arch to spur.

When I a wee lil squirt of a child, and I hadnt yet learned how to remember things, sumting verra terrible happened where I was born.  I not be sure who me birth parents were, or where dey lived, but de rumor be dat I lived somewhere in de Great Divide,and dat me clan was destroyed by some vicious group of bandits.   I been told by de Hithual in Spur  I have grown to call Kin dat  at about de time I was born, a travesty was discovered.  A  party of Hithual traders made a sortie into de Great divide to get some sparklies from a small and remote clan of Hithual miners who specialized in diamonds,Clan Rocktough, only to find a scene of carnage and pillage which I dare not describe. All the clan were slaughtered, and de Colinth Argonix Hall was plundered.  I hear dat fer a long time after dat, de trade roads around de Great Divide where littered wid de carcasses of every known bandit or fool who decided to try his hand at a dishonorable lifestyle.

So ye may be asking, how'd I survive? I dunna know, but I kin tell ye how and where I was found.  A small group of  outcast Secians, and I dunna know how one could ever cast out a Secian, specially me finders, had taken up de practice of road healers.  Dey would care for trader and bandit, pilgrim and pagan. Dey would take payment in gems or in foodstuffs. Well, as dey were in de area of de Great Divide, knowing dat dey most prolly would be richly rewarded in sparklies fer der services, dey happened upon a womin hithual wid many arrows piercing her flesh, who had me in her arms wrapped in a blanket, nay, a womins breastmail. crafted from de finest diamonds. Apparently she had taken off her own protection, and wrapped it about me....But in her flight from what ever evils may have been chasing her, she died.  Well, when de lil ones found me wid me mudder, or so we tink, dey of course, took me in. 

Now, when dey took me in, metinks dat dey were not gunna keep me fer long. I tinks dat dey were jist gonna  keep me til dey found a nice lil hithual home fer me.  However, dere daughter, Atexic Cherubican, who was bout me age, just a lil one (a real lil one, when she was young, she woulda fit in de palm of me hand) took a likin' to me. Me lil clumsy self would keep gettin lil hirts and aches, and she got to practice her healing on me.

De parents, dey really liked me, fer a coupla reasons. First off, I got along real well wid dere porter, a permanently maimed Oog-ra boxer, who had taken so many head shots, dat he had fergotten even his own name, but who we called Lugnut.  He was so stupid, dat even de udder Oog-ras laughed and called him names. De Cherubicans, being de kind harts dat dey are, decided to offer Lugnut a job in lugging about all dat dey couldnt fly wid. Now, Lugnut, fighter dat he was, was tankful for the nice tings dat day did fer him, but he jist could never unnerstand dere good harts. Dey never would lift a hand aginst anudder, and he was definitely de vengeful sort. In me, he found someone who he could pass on his fighting skills.

De Cheribicans, dey later also found dat I was good to have about fer anudder reason. De udder Hithual tell me it be in me jeans (or is it genes), dat I kin find diamond sparklies better den any udder race. In fact me reputed clan all shared me trait...I had de ability to tell good diamonds from paste jewelry, and given a chunka ore, I could tell ya mosta da time wedder dere was a valuable gem widin. Ill come back to dat.... 

Now,  Lugnug, fer all his past, was a real sweety.  As soon as I was old enuff to swing me arms, he made a wooden practice sword fer me. He would den let me try to poke past his shield and hit him in de chest. We called dis game Poke a Dope. I dinna know at de time dat he was making fun of himself, but we would play this all de time, untill finally after about 4 years, I finally poked him...
I guess it says alot about his skills and me persistance.  Well anyways, during dis time, cause neither Lugnut or I could master Secian, and I  couldnt master  Oog-ra (all that grunting is too hard on de vocal cords), Lugnut, in his desire to  speak someting besides Common, taught me Battle. Now,  me Battle aint dat good, but whadya expect, I learned it from a punch-drunk Oog-ra!

Atexic would watch us two spar, and she would provide the healing and de light banter.  More often den not, she would be tending after the times when me stick slipped and poked Lugnut somewhere besides his chest or after Lugnut gave me one of his playful swats. His swats were purdy nasty. After all dat fighting in de Gladiator pit, his hands had permanently curled into a fist, and cuz he was so addled, he sometimes fergot his own strength. Course, after he had knocked me silly, he was VERY apologetic.

When I turned about 10, Lugnut decided dat it was time fer me serious training. I tink he woulda liked it if I had followed in his footsteps and taken up hand to hand, but even he realized dat since he was de only one I could train wid, dat even though I was much faster den him, dat I had no chance of ever getting past his arm span. So he taught me all he knew. First off, he taught me three stalwart fighting skills, ones dat no fighter should be widout. Right off, he handed me a sword, a shield and a first aid kit, and gave me de basic moves and strategies to be adequate in dem. He also taught me Poles, so that I could reach him in attacks and keep him sharp skillwise too. One thing he did as i got more vicious and hit more often was to hold me by my head with his long ol arm, as i struggled futilely to swing me sword at him. Boy, dat worked me up!

Even though de Cherubicans were all Heart clerics, apparently Atexic's dad, Frankincense, had at one time been a sword cleric. He taught me the means to weave and invoke a fire dart and a strength Aura. One fer the things I could not reach, and one to save me skin if me First Aid failed.

This is also de time when I got me last name, Scurlinut.  Lugnut, was definitely a Lug, but cuz as i got older and more skilled, and learned to dodge his attacks, he called me Squirrelly nut. His diction some how allowed it to come out as Scurlinut, and I carry that name with pride.

The skills were all verra hard to learn but Cuz I was in a family of Heart Clerics, me First Aid neer saw much use. Tee-hee. That Atexic however, really got good wid dat laying of hands...

Speaking of Atexic, one day, we happened to be in de same area of the Great Divide as where I was found. Since I was old enuff to realize dat I wasnt going to grow up to look like who I thought were me parents (I was already twice as tall as dem and not even half as cute!), I started asking dose nasty questions dat any adaptee asks. "Who were me parents?" "Where are they?" "Why did dey leave me?". It was den dat Frankincense, and his wife, Myrrh, decided to show me (and Atexic too) me past. 

We went up inta de Mountains were me mom was found. Frankincense gave me the story, and as I walked about in a daze, mumbling under me breath me disbelief, crying forlornly, I felt verra strange. Dere was sumting about dese hills dat caused me to vibrate. I felt a sense of power and knowing dat  I neer realized before. I grabbed some of de dirt, held it to me face, inhaled, and sensed someting dat made me scurry about poking at de ground.  Within 3 stabs wid me sword, der was a "ching" . I got down on me knees and started burrowing inta de ground as fast as me stubby lil fingers would allow me. I pulled dis stone outta de ground,
and held it up fer the Cherubicans to see.  "What is dis? Why do it sing out to me to find it?" They all went "Ahhhh!" and Atexic ran up to me and grabbed it outta me hand. She den proceeded to coo over it and tried to stick it in her forehead. This clear lil rock was of obvious interest to me Secian kin.

"What is the stone, you ask?" said Frankincense. "That would be a  sparklie! And that sparklie is called a diamond! Very priceless!"
"Why is Atexic trying  to stick it in her head?", I asked. "That is a story fer another time, but Atexic is missing something very important that all secians quest after" said Myrrh.

Well after all de excitement over the stone was done, I realized dat I sensed more of dese stones in de hills about me. I asked Frankincense if he wanted any more of dem stones, and he said "Yes Yes! They can make us not hafta wander he roads any longer!  Can you find more?" I said yes, cuz I saw dat I finally could repay dem fer all dey had done fer me. We set up camp, and over the next two months. I found hundreds of de lil clear stones. Dat was when I was christened Jimnoodle. Like some folk kin find water wid dem diviners, or as some call em water witches,  I was  called  the Gemnoodle for my diamond finding abilities. However, in their secian dialect of Common, it came out Jimnoodle. People in Spur find me name odd, but now at least dey know de story.

After all dis gem finding, the Cherubicans realized dat I was old enuff to go out on me own. Dey also knew dat it was time for Atexic to go out and seek those things that she was now seeing a need fer. They told me that Atexic must go out and seek this fearsome beast called a Dragon. After dey explained what a dragon was I whitened paler den a sheet and said why me. I would be dere lunch!
But dey assured me wid Atexic by me side, dat no harm would befall me cuz there be a special bond tween Dragons and Secians. 

Dey also entrusted to me care 1/2 of de diamonds dat I had found and said dat I was to use them fer two purposes, Provide for any needs dat Atexic and I may have on our journey, and once we were to our destination, to help clear the Cheribican name. Dey den told me of dis place called the Training Grounds of Spur, from where I could gain access to Spur, the richest, most diverse, and biggest place in de lands. It was there that I could learn more of the skills dat I had learned from Lugnut and Frankincense and be  able to fit in to Spur widout looking like a country bumpkin. Once I learned to act like a city boy, dey told me that I should do three things, find me true  kin, the Hithual,  promote Atexic to her fellow Secians and the Draggies, and find Sylvenn, her cousin, who would help Atexic get acclimated to the city ways.
 
Well, me hart was broke, to think that dat I would hafta leave me adopted parents and me fighting  mentor Lugnut, but even me saw dat It was time fer both me and Atexic to find our way in de world.  I wanted to find me Hithual kin, to find out bout me past, and to hopefully learn enuff skills to avenge me parents death, and I also cared so much fer Atexic, and saw dat she needed to find a way fer becoming fully herself, and I tink draggies be de answer. So we set off on de Caravan road to the distant Training Grounds. After many travails (A nudder long and different story), we ended up at de Training Grounds.  

Dere,  Atexic and I met many other aspirants to the arch of Spur, and developed  some freinds, but mainly we settled inta the Troll Caves, and kilt so many Trolls dat I amassed me own fortune, of over a million silvers, all of which went into buying dem expensive herbs when I crossed over into Spur. She became great enuff and devoted enuff to her god dat she was a rezzer in no time!

What happened to Atexic, and her parents and me trusty bud Lugnut? Well I have been many years in de lands, and much has happened.  Lugnut finally after years of lugging about stuff and trying to stay fit, finally lost da battle to arthitis, and died a rather stiff and unseemly death, At least cuz he had de Heart clerics about , dey helped make his passing painless. Me only regret is dat I wasnt dere to give him me tanks and me good byes.

Atexic's Parents, after Atexic and I cleared der name, settled down along the Caravan road and built the fanciest hotel and spa  fer road weary travelers, and tended to dere needs. Dey were just too used to caring fer others dat dey wanted to spend dere last days easing udder's pain. They spent dere last days raining care down on all dat wanted to stay at de inn.  

Alas, Atexic, left Spur widout finding eider a mate or a draggie.  De Taxes were to costly even fer her, and she decided to take over de Inn from her parents when dey died. I go to see her once in de while, but me has finally found me kin here, and find dat Me hart is better acclimated to de city, I aint no country bumpkin no more, and have too many responsibilities here. When I need peace, I go to see Atexic, but she frankly hates de big city. So our paths rarely cross.  

So ifn ya wonder why I giggle so much and talk so funny, I tank my Secian parents and me Oog-ra mentor. I tinks dat I even learned to be empafetic  too.  I have de hardest time killing udders, I generally just like giving em a Lugnut like swat.  Course I still wish I could speak Secian, and I have a special place in me heart fer dragons, but me main goal in life is to seek justice for those who killed me real parents and in general defend de weak and  downtrodden.

My Beginning
By Starman Comet

I have been pondering over much time "should I explain some of myself".
The conflicts within me have started anew and I think it is time.
         
I awoke dazed and confused, not sure where I was.
look
[Training grounds.]
You find yourself atop a broad platform. To the north you can see the 
Faint outline of a city, and to the east you see the Spurian Academy built 
to aid new adventurers.
This area is illuminated.
Obvious paths: north* east*.

Then I heard voices, someone was approaching, 2 beings entered from the east "ooh look a Frontacian!" her eyes got wide, and her companion shuffled her off north. "What the heck is a Frontacian?" I muttered. "Well I am the only one here so it must be me". Just then I realized, I did not only know, what I was, but who I was, or where I came from. I sat down and put my hands to my head, I then realized I had Something in my hand, it was a piece of parchment. I opened it and started to read.

  
You should now be in the Training grounds of Spur. You will find things there to help you grow. Find out about your race and the powers that are yours! You have great Potential and this is for your own good. You will come into your own rights as time will tell. Forgive us for doing this to you when you do finally remember us. 
 
With all our love and Hopes...

The parchment then burst into Flames I leapt back as I dropped it on the ground, and it burned without leaving a trace. I at least now knew a little, but I knew that I dared not let anyone know that I did not remember, who I was or why I was, at least some little voice in my head told me that. So I set out to explore, and to learn who I Starman Comet really was! Suffice it to say I went to the academy. I learned about casting, and invoking, and Channeling Magick. I stood around and listened, and I learned about the archives, and the lore center, and most of all I learned about Frontacians and why most people
shunned them...It seems we have this incredible ability to gain fatigue back when ever we need it, well actually only if there is another creature around, we can drain theirs. It does seem to make most want to avoid us! well no matter I thought I really wanted to avoid questions anyway. So I learned to hunt alone (and most times die alone).
  
I started wandering around this training ground and found the cemetery. I used my magick to fight skeletons, zombies, spirits, ghouls, wights, and shades. I learned to avoid being hit too much by casting, then moving up or down in the room and letting these creatures chase me around. I usually got hit at least once per cast; my firemace took 15 seconds to cast then, I would get up move up in the room and wait, the creature would move to my rank and I would drain it then move again and cast. Spell casting then was a little different because I could cast another spell without waiting for the first to go away. People still avoided me, I did not laugh or interact with them either, we went our own ways, although sometimes one of those little creatures called Secians would heal me when I was not looking; (boy they get annoying at times).
  
Back then I think the Gods where on Holiday because when you departed after death you could not be returned to a Temple, and sometimes you woke up in Spur, and sometimes you woke up in TG. After my first episode of this crazy resurrection I decided to try spur, I was level 3 and I had some money and my runes were almost gone. I listened and found out where I could recharge and
buy different runes. I had vigor and healing rune implanted, and recharged the rest of my runes and I bought an herb called reduxa. By this time what little money I had was just about gone. I decided to see what Spur was about, I went into the poor district and found what was called the Thieves Maze. OOH BOY !. What a mistake that was! I died 5 times in less time than it took for me to stand up. After my sixth time dying I found myself back in TG! What a break for me. I told myself that if I ever found myself in that place again it would be too soon. I now knew that I would need to get allot better and that I would need something better than the leather armor I had! When I looked around Spur I had 
seen that almost all had Glamorous Armor that I had never seen here in TG. I shook the cobwebs from my head and headed north to the cemetery. I went back to what I had been doing before but concentrated on Shades only, I needed money first for armor I also knew that to find out more about Frontacia and myself I would have to get back to Spur!
I started into my same routine fighting shades but now I could at least heal some, and my First aid worked okay, when it kicked in, and I now had some more life thanks to the reduxa. I still was not interacting with anyone except to make sure they did not take my kills. Then one night actually morning because it was an hour or so till dawn, I was getting my butt kicked by a shade and we were both close to dying. when this little female just over 1' tall came in and stepped between the shade and me, I thought to myself "well what the $^%(^& is she doing this is my shade! ". She then touched my arm, the pain and the slash were gone. She defended me again as the shade missed me and then hugged the shade! I was bewildered. "What are you doing little one?", I asked. "Mees helping yous, see you arm no more hurted. "she replied. Then she giggled. "why are you hugging the shade?", I asked. "soes hims can't run away! Silly!". She giggled at me again. The three firemace's and the fire dart I had just cast took their toll and the shade died. I stripped the shade and looked around and she was gone.
  
I sat after opening the chest and retrieving, the money and gem, and treated myself, (it took five tries), cast a heal, and a vigor and I was good to go on. (by the way those 2 spells heal and vigor took about 20 seconds each to cast then). I stood up and as I turned to leave another shade jumped out at me. I went through my normal routine and got two firemace's off and got whacked twice and guess who showed up? Yep, that little female was again defending the Frontie from the big bad shade! She looked up at me after hugging the shade, giggled and said, "Oh boys these shadies sure do like yous!". Needless to say the results were the same it died and she was gone, But not before she jibed, "try nots to gets so hurted next times!". I was flabbergasted, I was furious, and I was confused!! I stripped the shade got the chest and went looking for her.
 
I found her outside the gate healing herself (it was peacebonded out here so no creatures could attack). I looked around and sat, we were the only ones here. I asked, "little one why did you defend and heal me?". She looked at me and giggled! "Because that what mees does! silly!". "But I am Frontacian!" She frowned in thought, "So". "Most all here avoid me and yet you defended and healed me why?? "I asked. She looked as if she was thinking that over ,then replied with a giggle, "Silly! mees told yous, yous were hurted and that is what mees does! Mees not care if yous Frontie!" This is when I started to Mumble! It was bad enough that she giggled at me, but she kept calling me Silly and said she did not Care if I was a Frontacian?? I tried to control my temper, I am not sure why, but their was something about her that was familiar. "You are not afraid of me little one?" I asked. She looked at me as if she was now confused, and said "whys would mees be afraid of yous? Yous no hurted me, yous hurted the shadie, and hims hurted yous! Mees just healed yous.". "Most here avoid me, as I am Frontacian, they are afraid I would drain them or hurt them with my magick." I answered. "Mees don't judge someones by dems race. Mees help dems then if dems hurts mees mees keeps aways from dems.
 
I was now the one confused, could this little creature really be so unselfish, could she really have wanted to heal me without thought of some monetary return?

"Little one do you hunt"? "Sometimes mees hunts wif mees Draggie friends. They gives me sparklies, but all mees monies go to my God SA". "Why would you give your money to a God?" "Silly! To get favors. Mees a cleric and when me get enough favors mees will be a Rezzer, plus mees need favors for mees prayers to be answered". I knew what a Rezzer was but I was not too sure of this favor and prayer thing she was talking about, so I asked. Suffice it to say that I found out I had just made a big mistake. She looked at me, saw that I was also of SA, and went into a thirty-minute tirade of teaching and berating, and I am pretty sure she only took 3 breaths the whole time. She then told me to go donate some of my money to Sa and she would teach me to Pray. 
 
I can tell you this, if you have ever been yelled at by a Secian for something they really believe in, I had two choices, go donate, or die by incessant chatter, I donated. When I came back she taught me to pray and also taught me more about SA and explained (15 minutes non-stop) some of the other little known facts about clerics and Secians. I still do not know somewhat she said because about half way through I realized I liked this little flighty female, and I kind of lost my train of thought. I finally got in a word and asked "little one would you hunt with me some more"? She giggled "mees name is Kadissa not little one, Silly!" "And my name is Starman not silly!!" She giggled and then kissed me on the cheek. I was so astounded I blushed. She jumped up and followed me and said "Let's get some shadies!" we went inside and hunted, we killed 2 more shades and some other undead creatures, the whole time she flitted about hugging, healing, and chattering. 
  
I finally got tired, as it was late and I took her back out the gate. When I tried to give her some of the money she refused and said. "Mees dragies gives me monies you keep it." I offered her a gem and she refused that also! I was dumfounded! A Secian who refused gems? She really was unselfish. I finally persuaded her to take the gem by telling her to Donate to SA. I took my leave and departed for the night.
  
Over the next weeks I saw her off and on again. She would be outside the Gate of the TG cemetery healing the wounded. She would pop in and out of the gate checking on me and healing me if I needed it. She would go back out and heal some more wounded then come back again. After a while the rush of wounded would slow down and she would begin to lecture me some more on SA and healing others. It was actually wearing me down. I found myself looking forward to our talks and I started to help her when she was healing. I would cast vigor's at her after she would lay hands on others, to help her get her strength back. The presence of so many people was still a little much for me but I did it anyway. I did not stay out there long, just enough to cast a few vigor's on her, and a few heals on some of those hurt, and I would go back in to hunt. When we did hunt she had this annoying habit of tickling me as we tried to find something for me to kill. Sometimes she would do it while I was fighting something. I would mumble or frown every time and she would giggle at me (another of those annoying Secian traits)(or so I thought back then). I did ask her to stop once and she shocked me, actually made me blush. She kissed me. She then giggled and said "Nopes mees wants to sees if mees can makes yous smiles. Yous frowns too much". She giggled at me again and then she turned and was gone. I started thinking about what she said, and I realized I did not know how to smile or laugh. I had spent so much time avoiding others I did not even know why one would do that. I thought about it a while and finally came to the conclusion that I needed to learn more about how other races acted and interacted. I also thought that what I learned might help me find some insight to myself.
  
I started to spend more time at the gate helping Kadissa heal the wounded. I did not speak much except to her. I also found people thanking me for either the vigor, healing, or FA I gave them. This all was so new and confusing, people actually not even let me touch them they even started to ask for my help. Let me tell all you glowheads something, you think you got the market on confusing, watch what happens when someone sincerely asks a Frontacian for help! 
  
After one of these healing sessions and the crowd thinned, Kadissa and I as usual talked. It was then I started to call her little sister. It came naturally, she was of Sa, and so was I. And all her antics, and lectures were starting to do something to me! I also could not shake the unnerving feeling that she was Familiar to me. This time when she tickled me I grinned. I did not realize how much this little act of grinning would do. She jumped up and down giggling and hugging me and saying "sees me knews yous could not outlast mees". It's weird but I felt good about seeing her so pleased. After that whenever she tickled me I grinned. It was such a small thing and it pleased her so much, I thought what could it hurt. Little did I know at the time how much it did change me?
  
During this time I advanced in some levels and my runes were about gone. I decided it was time to move on to spur. Three days before I left I told Kadissa. She looked up at me and said that she too had to move on to spur. Before we could talk about it anymore there was a rush of wounded. She started to Lay hands, and I started to help with my limited healing skills. After everyone was fixed up she looked at me and asked if I wanted to hunt some shades. I said sure. Well little did I know what she had in mind! The little imp jumped up and yelled "anys ones that wants to hunt shadies follow Starman!" I was in shock, for the next thing I knew, 2 fighters, a cleric and Kadissa where following me.  

She started explaining how the fighters, even though they could not hit the shades, would take the brunt of the attacks, with me in the background casting and her and the cleric healing. These Tactics where not new to me, I had seen others do it before. Before I had time to reconsider, she was pushing me towards the gate and yelling something I did not really hear I was still in shock! We advanced through the cemetery and found a shade almost immediately. The Tactics worked well and I settled in to it fairly easily. We killed 2 shades and some other undead and we where pretty pleased with ourselves none of our party had died, and we had made some money, and had a couple of chests that the fighters were carrying.        
  
Then something happened that I never expected! We walked into a room and a shade jumped out and hit Kadissa and knocked her down. She had forgotten to retreat. I figured she would get up and move so I cast at the shade and as I did another jumped out and hit her also! I yelled for her to get up. As she retreated I cast 2 darts in quick succession at the first shade. The second one advanced towards Kadissa and I knew she could not take anymore hits so I lead her out of the cemetery fast, not realizing that the fighters had fallen down and were no longer following. As we exited the gate she looked ashen and as she sat something happened to me that never happened before. My eyes slowly clouded over with a red haze and a rage built in me like a forge fire. I heard Kadissa's voice in the distance saying I had left the fighters and the other cleric in the cemetery. I whirled and ran back through the gate to the room I had left. The fighters were valiantly fighting a losing battle for they could not hit the shades, and the little cleric was scrambling as he tried to heal them as fast as he could! I am not real sure what happened next. The rage that had been building in me suddenly flared, and all reason left me. The next thing I knew was that I was standing over the shades still trying to cast as they lay dead before me, and I was slashed and cut with little life left in me. Two chest lay next to the shades I picked them up and stumbled out to gate as I exited I collapsed and started to go unconscious.
  
When I awoke the fighters were looking at me as if I was from another world and Kadissa was at my head stroking my hair. I sat up and asked them if they were all right and they just continued to stare at me. I asked them "what is the matter, and why do stare at me?" I realized I was speaking Frontacian and that they could not understand me. I quickly spoke in common and asked them again what was the matter. They both started to babble at me at the same time. Finally the Cleric stepped forward and started to speak. "After you came back in you just stood for a moment, then you yelled something in Frontacian. Started casting at the shades, you drained, retreated, cast, drained, retreated, alternating between one or the other, and then started to drag these fighters out of the room one at a time, then ran back in, all the while shouting something we could not understand. Every time you took one of us out you stood toe to toe with the shades screamed, cast, then drained. Just before you took me out you killed the first shade and the second was near death. You had been hit multiple times by the shades and you were pale. I tried to heal you but you would not sit and did not listen to me, and when I cast a heal at you, you already had taken me out the gate and ran back in. Five minutes later you staggered out the Gate and collapsed." The Fighters nodded in agreement.
 
I looked around for a second then said, "it must have been something I ate". That got a slight chuckle from everyone but Kadissa she just smiled slightly, and looked at me with those big eyes of hers. "Come on lets split up the loot we have" I said as I started to think of a way to explain My lapse in time. Luckily they all just followed me and did not ask for any explanation. 
  
I don't mind telling you I was scared! A side of me that was dark and raging had shown itself and I did not know why or how! I also did not seem to have any regard for my own life when this rage took over. I knew I would have to find a way to control this rage, but first I had to learn what caused it.
 
We opened all the chests got the gems and monies and went and sold the gems and split all the money. I never said a word the whole time except to lead them. I was deep in thought. After we got to the bank we disbanded. And I was going to go think for the night. Before I left Kadissa hugged and kissed me. I just stared at her a bit. I said, "goodnight little sister. Be well! Sleep well! Hopefully we will see each other in spur". She giggled slightly and said, "of course we will silly". I left then to go think.
 
As I reflect on this now I come to the same conclusion I did then. For some reason the little Secian had won her way into my Family. A family I knew nothing about, but She had become the little sister I needed at the time to help me move on and to advance in my knowledge of myself, she also taught me something about trust. She taught me to judge others by their actions towards me, and not how they reacted, or interacted with others. Sure you get knowledge by watching how others interact but how they react to you has a different meaning. Some may not know, but this type of judgement is actually a Frontacian trait it took me a while to figure it out but it is true.       
  
As for my rages they come and go. Not so bad as the first time but they are still with me. As I learn more about my past, and myself they have lessened in the way they affect me. I have also learned that the note I arrived with was from my foster parents, and some how they had not only wiped out my knowledge but also all my past training before they sent me to spur. 
   
On a side note to all the little Secians out there and especially Trinidad. I know why you covet your little sparklies so much. You are truly Part Frontacian!! 

TO BE CONTINUED (maybe)

Tony Antaro's Autobiography
By Tony Antaro

I was born in the wealthy and beautiful city of Sirion on the east of the Great Mountain. My name was Tony Panasonic, now Tony Antaro, this will be explained later on why i changed my last name.  My father was the head knight under the King of Sirion.  My father was a noble and brilliant man, he always fought for justice and peace.

My mother met my father when he traveled through Leuia while heading back to Sirion from a battle.  They met in her father's palace in Leuia, when the king invited the army to sleep in the castle. My mother was a princess, who loved my father at first sight.  They married a week after they met.

I was raised by both my parents. My mother taught me love and respect, while father taught me about knighthood and honor.  When I was 21, I went to train into the King's army of knights,  I was quick to learn due to my father's help.  I was one of the few who were knighted. Since my father's name was Tony also, they called me SirTony the Second.  During my 36th summer, my mother gave birth to a baby girl which bore strike resemblance to her, light brown hair and green eyes.  My parents named her Vixxen Narlanda.

When I became 40 I went wandering around the Great Mountain to visit some Drag-Al villages in the surrounding area.  One day, I entered the small village of Pretalia on the base of the Great Mountain.  The village was being ransacked by hordes of Taathians.  I saw a drag-als being carried away by the Taathians.  I turned around and tried to hide but I was hit by a poisonous  dart and was knocked unconscious.  When I awoke the next day, I felt a little disoriented and I had no recollection of what happened the night before.

After awhile, I wandered to Tanga and lived in a small hut.  After a few months, I ventured to Spur to seek a new life and because I wanted to start a new life I changed my last name to Antaro.  In Spur, I met Olan Deathstryke, now Olan Windsword. Olan was one of the nicest person I've met, he was also my first mentor.  Olan helped me out in my early years in Spur, along with another human BlueDragoon Smnidyke.  These two people helped me in becoming better skilled in the arts I were taught.  Since I looked up to these two, I joined the same guild as they, which is the Fighter's Guild.

When I was 50, I received news from a town crier that both my parents died.  The crier had with him the blade that belonged to my father.  This unique blade called the Golden ancestral drag-al blade was forged when he became head of the King's army.  He won every battle with the blade.  I then traveled back to Sirion to pay my respects.  While there, I didn't see my little sister.  I asked my neighbor where she was and he told me that she had went to Spur to look for me.  I then went back to Spur to find my sister.  As I walked into Town Square Central, a beautiful anthian caught my eye.  Her name was LilyOfTheValley Callantia.  I proposed to her after a day later to marry me and she said yes.

We planned our wedding to be 2 weeks from that day.  But she disappeared a week before the wedding.  I was devastated at her disappearance, but at that moment my little sister was in the room and comforted me.  I was glad to see my sister but sad because my fiance was gone.  Vixxen and I talked for a while and she introduced me to her husband Tigerman Foeslayer.  Tigerman introduced me to his brothers Tholen, and WarPanther, and his sister Kriss.

One month later Vixxen disappeared along with Tigerman and Kriss. All my blood relatives were gone except for my brother-in-laws. A month after their disappearance I was stripped of my title as a knight.  I hated the Elders of the land for doing this since I cherished and upholded my title.

Today, there are two people which I respect like family, I think they are the two closest people in my life so far.  Rother the Leuian and Panick the Drag-Al, they are like brother and sister to me.  I help them as much as I can and they help me as much as I can.  Other people that are like family are the Taathian fighters, who stick at my side when I am in trouble, and I help them when they are in trouble no matter what.

A Raven's Tale
By Aubrei RHRashakae

<<He had the head of a raven and the body of a raven. In fact, he was a raven.>>-
Aubrei RHRashakae, This DFC

This is the story of the 6 foot tall raven that made the unfortunate mistake of coming into Town Square, speaking of the Lords of Chaos.   His name was Obzaj, and he had grown up in the swamps of Monitan.  As a young bird, while practicing his mimicking, he had made a grievous mistake; never mimic one with a huge ego.  He spent most of his time forced to eat the various knats and bugs that inhabited the Ninny's residence, a large, Hot rock.  As insects seemed to be drawn to the lizard like a magnet, Obzaj soon grew large, larger than one of the most studly Anthians in the Realms, Aubrei.  ( Shameless Self Plug, my fault).  When the target of his mimicking became of age and moved to Spur, Obzaj spent a long time sitting. He wasn't sitting or thinking, or sitting and planning, he was just sitting.  After some time, a figure appeared in front of him, wearing a shiny pin. It read " Hi, my name's Bob, and I'm a Lord of Chaos".  Bob explained to Obzaj, over a course of many years, the doings of the Lords of Chaos, and their beliefs and motives. 
While he felt this a bit difficult to comprehend, being a raven after all, he got the general idea.  As he matured, he was given a spell for summoning help and was dispatched to the Spur to ease the growing fears.  He is currently being digested by Leo and his mate.

Agent of S.A.N.  Mission 437
By Aubrei RHRashakae

As I sat in one of the many piles of vomit caused by Aros' and Britteney's wedding, I pondered the new and different occurrences that were rocking my beloved city of Spur. The Lords of Chaos, Kbar's new belief, were on most peoples minds.  They didn't really bother me, I figured the better Gods would win out in the end, though no one could agree on whom that was.  If worse came to worse, I could always pants these Lords of Chaos, causing turmoil that hasn't been seen since... Well, it hasn't been seen, yet.  As I sat in this vomit, probably Solic's, it smelled of ego, Commisioner Shortly contacted me.  " Aubrei, you have another mission", she said, her voice echoing through the room. "Oh, what's that?" I thought as hard as I could. "I'm right here, Agent" Turning around, I noticed a shadow, talking to me.  Two hours and three wet trousers later, I calmed down, pleading with her not to sneak up on me.  She refused, saying it made her happy. Remembering Kbar, I let it go at that, happiness over all and so on.  After a change of clothes and some sedative herbs, I asked what my mission was.  She replied " It has to do with the Lords of Chaos, find out why they're coming, and what we can do about it".  "Should I try to scare them away?" I asked, trying to sound Knightly.  " I'm sure you'll do that anyway, Agent, but no, we don't know for now whether to welcome them or to bar the door."  This sounded reasonable, even though I had lost her when she said "I'm sure", I smiled and nodded.  Sort of like talking to a wall, or Jazbo. When she finished babbling, she said, "Did you get all that?" I nodded, and she replied " Good, now go, Agent, and spread Smiles"   I stood up, and began walking south, knowing none of what she said.  She stopped me, and admonished " Town Square is that way, start there"  As she faded from view, I wondered whether or not I had it in me to complete this mission.  Oh well, I decided, now that I'm hungry constantly, I could make a pretty silver piece from those turnips...

As I approached Town Square Central, I noticed a strange sucking sensation.  "Even the ninny doesn't suck this much" I mumbled to myself, and went in to TS.  A strange site it was, a large black Vortex, bigger than a Dragon, smaller than Zuril's appetite.  In fact, much, much smaller.  On a side note, I remembered that there was an emergency meeting of the Cooks Guild (Blade, Zuril, and myself) to discuss whether or not the Thugian's corpse eating was bad for business.  We decided it didn't, we deal with a more refined crowd, like those who enjoy bat wings and snake jerky.  Shaking myself out off my stronger than normal Stupor, I looked into the lack of light we call the vortex. I remembered the strange circumstances that prevented all who entered it to remember what they saw.  I wondered if it had to do with the Lords of Chaos, and I wondered if the rumors I had heard about Michael joining them were true.  Suddenly, a new figure appeared. He had the head of a raven and the body of a raven. In fact, he was a raven. But he was big.  He must have been 6 feet tall. ( Mind you, I'm 4'2", 6 feet is huge)  Anyway, he began speaking of the coming of the Lords of Chaos.  He told the Spurians gathered there that they had no reason to fear them, that in fact they only feared change, as is the nature of sentient beings.(all those who are reading this for the moral, this is your stop).  I nodded, believing more and more of what he said.  When he was attacked, as seems to be a more and more common greeting these days, he summoned gigantic (7 feet) lions to defeat his attackers.  They, startled by the change of scenery, promptly ate him.  Burping feathers, they slunk south, in search of more food.  As they left, they looked at me and walked on, those who understood Leuian told me later that they figured I'd stick in their throat.  "How nice" I muttered " At least they noticed me this time"...  Believing that in fact, they were scared of my humongous muscles, I sat down, and listened to the ramblings of those in Town Square.  Most were scared of the Lords of Chaos, some were discussing how to defeat them, some were trying to have others convert with them.  I, as a firm believer in the Unknown, as I've been since I was old enough to decide, was not scared by there coming, as I'm not now.  I welcome more gods, the old ones might be glad for the company. Of course, if they bring destruction and chaos, Jimbo might just have to Nuke em...

"Thoughts of a Penthanian"
By Anonymous

I feel it... again.

I feel it as his icy stare penetrates my body, my mind, my soul.

I feel it as he looks through me and holds my attention like an iron vice.

I feel the hate, flowing forth from his body, firing out at me like hundreds of tiny arrows.

I feel the pain of a thousand deaths, of a million hateful emotions, bristling from his multifaceted eyes.

And yet, I feel nothing.

I feel little for this one -- his blade, his hiss, his dripping fangs.

I feel nothing for his life, or his hate.

He shows all that he fears through his limping gaze, his inferior visage of power.

He has not an ounce of bravery in his soul -- envy fills too much the pilings of his heart.

His vile, slavering jaws conceal the noxious stench of evil, save to those of us who know their true beginning, and end.

I feel only the gentle sting of steel against my hard skin, the sensation of firey power coarsing through my veins and out toward his bulky frame.

I feel no remorse, and no regret.

I feel no compunction as I watch his hateful smirk bend to a look of fear, of pain, as he is slowly consumed by the all-devouring power of magick.

I feel only loss.

Loss of life, loss of hope, loss of all.

And when all is said and done... what is left?

Eternal hatred, and then again,

Nothing.

Journal of a Dragon
By

(I found this on the way to the Fairgrounds.  I found it rather interesting and maybe you will too.)

Day One:  It is dark -- I suppose I am in a cave.  I was just born.  I decided to start this journal so all may know my life story.  My parents, both known to the mortals as 4th stagers or Imperials, are out most likely hunting.  I am not sure as to what will happen now.

Day 17:  I have learned all that I will need to know for now intellectually.  My parents and kin have been teaching me many skills such as channeling my inner power for magick and using mortal weapons since I have no claws and cannot bite effectively.  I have been taught that we dragons are the most superior, intelligent, and powerful beings.

Day 39:  I went out on my own for the past seven days.  It has been a test of strength, intelligence, and tactics.  I have returned home and got a rather "dragonesque" welcome.  Nothing very fancy.  They expected me to come back.  I guess it is not a big deal to survive for one week.  I observed how others, mortals lived.  I found it interesting.  The intellect of those known as the "Thugians and Oog-ra" I found were rather low and really were not quick on their feet.

Day 50:  Today I somewhat mastered my skill in using swords and other bladed weapons.  I was rewarded with an honorary sword in the forest.  I also witnessed one of my older kin stage.  It was very interesting.  He staged while he, his chosen, and I were hunting the undead wretches.  He looked as he was in much pain but he was ready for it.  In a matter of minutes, he went from a 6'6 tall humanoid to an 11'5 "second stage" dragon.  I was proud of his change, after living but two years of his life.  It is a gift bestowed to those naturally... and should be taken seriously.  I plan to keep recording until I change, as well.

Day 81:  It has been two weeks now and my kin have been telling me to find my chosen secian for when I change.  I have been warned by one, "It is better to be safe, than to be sorry."  So for the next month or so I am going to have to be searching.  I intend to develop a close, friendly relationship with my chosen, unlike others who seem to just give them things and then be healed during their change. 

Day 101:  Today I decided to go rather late and practice my magick skills.  I carried 120 gold in my pouch just in case I needed to stay at the local inn for the night.  Unfortunately, I had an unhappy circumstance.  A large cat-like creature that hid in the shadows took my coins as fast as they were gone.  I chased him far, throwing a fire dart at him, but he got away with my money.  I hope to be more careful and take more careful notice of what is around me next time.

Day 147:  It's been a while since I have recorded my actions, but I have found my chosen.  Her name is Emma.  She is a talented and powerful Secian, able to heal wounds instantaneously.  I went to the local Artificers Guild recently.  I had some armor forged and it will be ready very soon.  I have decided to go on an expedition around the city of Spur.  From Town Square Central, to the Poor Quarter, to the Merchant Area, to and through the Temple Zone, straight through the Rogue fields, to the Fair Grounds, around and about the Plains near Meetpoint and back to the lair -- perhaps I will record my exploits further upon completing the tour, or make a map.

Day 190:  As I farther master my skills in channeling magick and using bladed weapons, I decided to try to hone a new skill.  I decided to start practicing my Shielding with some of my kin.  As I get more powerful, I get more famous.  Now, strangers walk up to me and greet me, expecting that I know them.  I have also planned a three day trip in the wretch cave and come back with several treasures I can share with my kin. 

Day 245:  As I near closer to my changing, I master my magick.  I now can use the spell known as Translocation, which retroactively transports the caster to a memorized position anywhere in the city of Spur.  I know also have "pets" or "familiars," a destrier, war horse, and a lion, a large and powerful mammal.  I also found the robber that stole my gold on the day one-hundred and one.  It was a mere order I made and within seconds, I was grabbing his pouch and watching him run into the wilderness.  I believe he will not be coming back.

Day 270:  As I am now within one hundred days of my change, my elder dragons are telling me to keep my chose secian close at hand.  They warn, "Sometimes Dragon kind are caught early in change, and that's why you don't see more elder dragon.  So we say, keep your chosen close at hand."  I took these words very seriously.  For now on, my chosen is within one and a half mile of me.  

Day 303:  It is only two months away, two months away from the change I will incur.  I am more than excited, just not acting it out.  A dragons change is something special, so it should not be advertised.  Untill I do change, I am going to be staying alone with my chosen, for I do not want an enormous amount of spectators folling me around untill I do "stage".  So for now, no mortals, except for a select group of secians will be hearing, or seeing me until I do change.  

Day 329:  Now it is close, very close.  Its even hard for the elder dragons to predict when I will change.  All they know is that it is rather soon.  The are now telling me to keep my chosen next to me at all times,  either on my horse, or on my back, or wherever.  If im going to change, I require an instant pain transfer from my chose, or else.  Or else that is the end of Arnox.  So the next time I record, I will be Arnox, the Second Stage Dragon!

Day 366:  It happened, I have staged, the elders were right to keep my chosen close.  I staged on day three hundred and fifty seven.  This is known to be one of the earliest changes.  Thanks to the Knowledge of the elders, and the healing power of Emma, I can live my life as a Second Stage Dragon,  and in a few years, I will change again!

Sky
by Guztymne RHorawytzR


The sky is not crying-
it is watering the earth.
With love and gentleness,
it gathers the clouds
and shower the world.

The sky is not angry-
it is teasing the ground.
Like puppies chasing each other,
it shocks the ground with jolts
and rolls in laughter.

The sky is not unfeeling-
it is kissing mother earth.
With cold pecks on the cheeks,
the sky hugs the earth
with its cold breath.

Grypht looked up into the clouds.  They were slightly buldging at the seams, and he looked back to his scrolls and continued his work.  He recorded the speed of the wind, how bright the sun was, and any precipitation.  This was not really his job- he was unemployed.  He had a calling to be a Druid, but his caste did not allow that.  With a quivering quill in his claws, he scribbled on the scroll recording the weather around him.  He glanced back into the sky.  High up, the sun shone labourously.  The wind cooled the grass around the plains, and he could feel a storm brewing.  The sky was turning a shade between violent and azure, and Grypht got up to pitch a sheltering tent.  Grey cottonballs crowded the sky, and the first few drops of rain bombarded the ground.  Then, some more.  Then, more.  Then, a pattering and shower of rivers of water as if like in a waterfall.  The ground began to puddle and muddy up, and Grypht shook with excitement.  This, of course, was not his first experience of rain, but he was nevertheless thrilled.  

With some flint and stones, Grypht started a tiny flame.  He reached into his satchel and pulled up some luminescent green herbs.  They sizzled as he dropped them into the flame, and gave up some aromatic smoke.  He breathed it in and smiled in momentary tranquility.  As the smoke spiraled up into the sky, the rain began to subside.  Grypht grinned and noted the effectiveness of the spell.  Not bad- the rain was all gone.  Grypht packed up his scrolls from the wet ground and wondered:  How could people not love the rain?

The soft green smell of grass
mixed with wet earth-
the shimmering lights behind grey clouds,
the gentle massage of waterdrops
with tears rolling down skies, 
crying only in happiness of reunion.
The Rain is welcoming me home.

Rinannimas, Bardical Style
By Marigold Lyrian

Note-This piece was written by me quite a while back, and was meant as a Rinannimas gift of sorts for those who used to attend the recitals weekly.  Sadly, many of these people have since departed from these realms, but I hope you all will enjoy it as much as I'd hoped they would.


'Twas the eve of Rinannimas, 
And all through the guildhall
There lay bards passed out, clutching
Well-used bottles of alcohol.

I with my nightcap (a nice keg of rum)
And Allwyn beside me, drunk since half past ten,
Chelestra and Artee and Esper all hammered,
And there, giggling like Secians, sat Gypsie and Fynn.

Maire and Sparrowsong brawled like barbarians
While our consulting Editor "tested" the ale,
And when they heard of the drinks this event would be serving,
The entire Colinth Argonix showed up as well!

Then out in the courtyard there came a great crashing,
And I stumbled in stupor with quill boldly drawn
To investigate what irritated my headache
And cut short our masterfully done drinking song.

There sprawled on the lawn was a white-bearded man
Round as a melon, and clad all in red,
While off in the distance a cackle I heard
From a squad of eight deer running off with his sled.

I asked for his name and he said, "Santa Claus".
That was when I decided, "he's drunk, this old fogey",
Since we all know that Sant'a is not some mere human,
And besides, that explains why his cheeks were so rosy.

So I dragged him inside by the scruff of the neck,
As he babbled of prior commitments-poor fool-
And we propped up his girth 'gainst the wreath-festooned pillars
Vowing good-will and charity for derelicts on Yule.

As Allandra and Konichiwa wove garlands through his beard
And Depravato sang a tune that made this Drag-al blush,
It dawned on me, a few more drinks could do no harm this night
And so we opened every bottle, and let every barrel gush:

Now gin and now brandy, now whisky and wine!
Thugweiser and roo-brew and tankards of mead!
To the roof of my mouth, to the back of my throat,
To the pit of my stomach and straight to my head! 

As ale mugs clashed together and the froth spilled to the floor,
Hours passed-but our friend Santa seemed quite unconcerned with time;
He lead many a bawdy Rinannimas carol, 
By sunrise, on his eighteenth tequila with lime.

That morning in Town Square came presents, of course,
From Sant'a (the real one, it's needless to say),
Yet even when our human fellow seemed quite sobered up,
He ran off, never seen again, and screaming about a sleigh!

However, I'm convinced he was just a madman off the street,
And so I shall not worry with the likes of such as him,
But rather I'll wish you, in holiday spirits,
A FINE RINANNIMAS TO ALL, AND MAY YER MUGS FILL TO THE BRIM!

A Lizard's Adventure from Monitan to Spur
By Blackcrow Twygg

It was a dark night in Monitan when I hatched.  I broke through the shell of my egg with ease.  I stood up on my hind legs.  Grabbed the hot rock that my real parents had left under my egg.  I walked north and than east until I saw tons of ones like myself.  There were so many I tried to count but quickly lost count somewhere after 100.  I looked to farther into the kingdom and saw a huge castle.  I talked to the citizens of Monitan and heard of a far off land named the Spur.  I found these stories to be amusing and thought they were fiction, little did I know they were true.  I walked up to the castle and its moat that was the only way to get into the castle as too keep out mammals.  Inside I found many pictures made in the swamps and brought to the castle.  I glanced at the pictures, at the time I never knew who they were.  I walked up onto the small area where the Empress and the Royal Consort had always presided.  They were not present at the time so I walked back to leave when my path was blocked by a huge lizard named Jazbo.  I saw his scars from battle and he showed my a little piece of a weed from the swamp that had "The holder of this material is the High Guard of the Empress".  I had found the high guard.  I was eager to ask questions but he wasn't out to answer my questions.  Since he was in charge of protecting the Empress he asked how I got in.  I responded, "I wondered in through the moat and the front of the castle".  Jazbo nodded and decided to let me go free this time.  I walked around the kingdom and saw a wounded lizard who was severely beaten and skinned.  He was barely alive.  I asked him in the native language, "Why do you lie in the swamp and how did you get so hurt?"  With he said with his last breath, "Don't go to the Spur, it is a violent place" soon he became limp and his body sunk into the swamp and sat at the bottom of the swamp for days.  I thought he was going to come up, I did not know that he had died.  I went to ask the lizards of my country the directions to Spur.  They wouldn't give me them, they only gave me the directions to a place called the TG or Training Grounds.  I had no choice for I did not want to live a life without
adventure.  I slept in the swamp one last night.  In the morning I got up, wove a bag from some swamp grass, than packed my hot rock in the bag for safe keeping.  I also packed a few corpses of animals that had died to natural causes and put them in my bag.  I head the direction of the Training Grounds when I was stopped by Jazbo again.  Jazbo pointed out to me that I could not leave the kingdom until I had talked to the Empress.  So again I walked to the castle where I was informed that the Empress and the Royal Consort were on a trip to the Spur and I would have to wait.  I waited for a day and a night and asked when they would be back.  Only one knew, he told me that it they were not going to be back for along time.  So I wondered around and found a small little cave near a small swamp, so I wondered in not knowing what to expect.  I found pictures of more lizards and saw a small hole near the end that I went into.  I lead south to 3 caves that were meeting caves, I looked north and saw some more caves that were full of decorations, I looked east and saw a bunch of seats crowed around a small area and a place that weapons were held, I also looked north east but I couldn't make out what was there so I walked up closer.  I stood near a small office where many a lizard were at work making wanted posters and posting them all over Monitan.  Here was a small canal that lead to the swamp outside of the small cave.  I got up and out of the swamp, took a long rest on my hot rock and went to see if the Empress was back.  As soon as I got up to the castle I was told that she was back but I would have to be cleansed before showing up before the Empress.  So I followed a poor servant up to a small pool area where I swam for awhile and then another lizard jumped right next to me.  It was the Royal Consort Aftertaste.  I did not know it was him I thought it was someone else asking permission to go to the Spur to protect the honor of our empress.  Walking out of the pool area I almost slipped, but regained my balance and stood up and went to see the empress.  I stood infront of the throne, knelt and spit at the empress.  She motioned to have the guards leave so we could talk privately.  I stood up, she again motioned to have me come closer, I stood next to her.  She almost read my mind and she asked if I was there for permission to go to the Spur and I spit at the empress and left to follow the directions to the Training Grounds.  When I got ready to go I had packed up my hot rock that my parents had left for me under my egg and put it in my grass bag but as soon as I got to my destination I found that the hot rock burned the grass and the rock had fallen out.  I realized that I had to just face it and I walked to the bank in the Training Grounds where I deposited my money and walked around for awhile and found some practice targets.  I swung my practice sword at the practice targets until I felt ready to be trained by a trainer.  I had a fairly good map of the Training Grounds that I had bought from a go-blin on my trip.  I looked at the map and head to the training area, the trainer threw me to the floor for awhile to teach me some new moves to hit more and be hit less.  I got out of the trainers and decided that I was ready to learn the level I had now a little better.  After I had been to the trainer five times the trainer told me that he could not train me to my next level for he was not that high a level himself.  I asked where I could get to train to the next level.  He slowly pointed towards an arch as he slowly explained a tale of the Spur.  It was boring so I left in the middle of his story to go back to Monitan and live a peaceful life in my homeland.  When I got home I found that the tax collectors had taken most of the Monitanians to jail for they could not pay their taxes.  I realized that I had to do something.  I went to the castle to only find that the Empress and Royal Consort had also lost a considerable amounts of money.  I walked to see what was left of the treasure area and they had to give most of it away to the tax collectors.  Now this was before the tax collectors had hit, just the announcement had made the Empress pay early.  I got the strength up to go back too look for the High Guard, but he was no where around. When I walked back to castle the Empress told me she had sent him to defend her honor against the tax collectors invading the Spur.  I asked if I was ready enough to go to the Spur and she just pointed towards a map hidden behind a curtain.  I read the map and it read, "When the lizard starts to ask if he is ready for something it means he is ready for it." and below was a map of the Spur.  I spit at the queen and royal consort.  I walked back to the training grounds and took all the money from the bank and walked through the first arch.  After that I walked back and forth realizing that once I left I could never come back.  I hesitated.  Then I remembered what was on the map and I walked down the golden arch.  In the middle of the Spur I stood, no one spoke my language until I met Ryia Monit.  She was nice and explained it as, "Your lucky I am in my 'be nice to newbies' mood".  I still remember that because if she had not shown me the way to the bank I would have been picked clean of the little money I had.  I asked her where the shop to buy pets was at and she showed me.  We walked down through the noble district than through a place called 'the rogues field'.  While down there we killed about 8 rogues and I was amazed since in the training grounds the only rogue I killed almost killed me so I always ended up running back to the black obsidian gate to get healed.  Afterwards she let me have all of the weapons and all of the pouches.  Than we walked in through some doors until we got to a shop to buy pets.  I bought a toad and when Ryia saw how poor I was she gave me 23k, which was a whole heck of a lot from the money I had from the training grounds.  That was shortly picked from me while I stood south west of TSC with my coin purse open.  When I told Ryia all my money was stolen she took me to the bank to show me that in the Spur I need to put my money in the bank in the Spur.  I had no money to put in, and I ran out of torches, she took me to the torch shop and bought me a torch.  The next thing I now while swinging at a rogue I accidentally hit my toad.  He died as soon as the mace hit him.  When I stopped weeping I sold everything I had from the rogues and got a pet black bear.  Me and my bear never stopped having fun, until the day the tax collectors hit I had to set him free because I was afraid I wouldn't be able to pay my taxes and be sent to the governors jail.  After I had set him free, I walked back to Monitan to tell the Empress we had lost our fight.  When I got back I stayed there for awhile and talked to the Empress and Royal Consort everyday.  Soon I asked to be adopted and I was, and also I was brought in to the Society of Reptiles.  The Society of Reptiles had its headquarters in that small cave by the swamp that I saw earlier.  Me and my new father than took a trip to the Spur.  We had killed many a thing and I learned lots and lots.  I also learned more than I could ever think.  When my father and I were separated I spent that time with Reno.  I asked him to become my uncle but he declined and said that he was too be part of another family.  I was disappointed for a short while, than I got over it.  Me and him just loved to get those cooks mad at us and while they swung at us we waved our shields hoping for a hit since we were terrible at it.  The next thing I know Reno disappeared and my father went back to Monitan.  Shortly after he resigned to give me the position as Conqueror lizard of the Society of Reptiles.  That was one of my proudest moments.  When I returned to the Spur I met a new person named Ogkay.  I had ran into Ogkay before but never really became friends with him for reasons unknown.  He taught me a few more things.  Like how fighters are more suited for sharps than the poles that I was using at the time.  He also pointed out the advantages of my magick, and the practice that landsharks would give me.  I meet a few other Spurians on my journeys, such as Amera.  Amera and I got along great and soon seeing that I was a lonely lizard with no 'free' female lizards around I asked Amera to become my life mate.  To my disappointment Amera turned me down for she had a previous engagement.  I got over it pretty fast, except I had to cut off my tail and that hurt a little bit.  My tail still hasn't grown back.  I also met two other dragon folk, Shanz and Zuril.  I never knew too much about Shanz but he made some good ale.  Zuril, well, umm... Zuril is a cook that likes to eat his food to much and thus making him heavy set.  Than I realized I had put my duties of the Conqueror of the SOR off for the past few months.  I walked down to Monitan to hold a meeting there, but there were few lizards and very few eggs.  I decided that since no lizards were left in Monit that I need to go up the Spur for the first meeting.  I had made a new constitution and got a few new members into the SOR during the meeting.  This is where I am today.
