Dear Readers,

Hail and well met!  Welcome to issue #7 of the Dragon Fire Chronicle.  Along with our monthly feed of stories and articles, I am proud to announce, this month, the inclusion of the brand new DFC word count prize list.  I know this has been a long time coming, especially for those of you anxiously wondering about your word count credits, but the wait is over.  At the end of this issue you will find the updated prize list, which has been converted into a system of "units" unlike the old list.  As far as DFC word credit goes, every 250 words written is equal to one unit.  Information on redeeming these prizes is forthcoming, but until then, perhaps this will give those of you stuck in the creative doldrums some motivation to write.  And, speaking of writing, you'll find a great deal of talent put into the works published in this issue.  With that said, I hope you all enjoy this month's contributions (and no killing the Editor in response to the new Top 5s...).

Keep your harpstrings dry,

Marigold Lyrian
Editor-in-Chief

Bronze 6
By Rhea Romero

Lobb came to with the sound of Inzy crying.  Briefly running through his knocked-up memory, he recalled that they had been on that hellish little cart and it had gone careening off the side of the track.  Which unfortunately happened to be over a steep slope.  He checked himself for injuries, only finding a few small gashes.  He stood up and walked towards the sobs.

"Usil," he said.  "You okay."

She started at the sound of his voice.  "It's my dress," she said with a gulp.  "Rehas.  He doesn't make things like this anymore."  She coughed and tried to get cool.

Lobb began to silently murmur a Hithual song of patience.

"Anyway," she said, "I'm fine, Lobb, thank you."  He heard her stand up.  She sounded like she might start crying again.

Lobb scowled.  He hated tears.  "You liked that dress a lot."  He lit up a torch.  The damage to the gown really was quite terrible.

Inzy sighed in perfect misery and slumped to the ground.  "It was so important to my whole existence, don't you see?"

"No."

"It was the facade."  Inzy sighed again.  "I was a very good thief, you know.  That's how I could afford this dress in the first place.  You know why?  Because no one ever suspects me of being one.  I was a neat little elf maid.  Most people don't even think that Usil Elves can be thieves.  And this dress," lifting the tattered blue remains, "I mean, I looked like a rezzer!"

Lobb looked her in the eye.

"Inzy," he said.  It was the first time he'd used her name.  She stared.  "It doesn't matter."

She continued to stare.

"It doesn't matter because you won't be going back to being a thief after this.  I know that much.  This is an enormous mission, Inzy.  If it works, we'll be relaxing in an opulent retirement on some far off island.  If it doesn't, we die.  You have to understand that."

She gulped.  "Really?"

He turned to the slope and started climbing.  She dashed up after him.

"Why do you know that, if you know nothing else?" she asked.

"I understand breadth.  Just not details."  Lobb concentrated on the crumbling rocks.

"Oh, just not details.  How do you know you aren't working for the wrong side?"

"And that means.."  They were close to the top now.

"Maybe when they cast that spell on you, they made you switch missions.  Maybe you're a traitor and don't know it."

He stopped and looked at her.  "Who's 'they'?"

"I dunno.  More details."  She pulled herself up onto the track and glanced at him.

Lobb thought for a moment.  Then he handed Inzy the torch and clambered to the top.  "Can't say who's right or wrong," he said.  "I'll trust my mind.  I say whoever I work for now is the good guys."

Inzy laughed.  "Okay, good enough.  I feel safer walking anyway."

Lobb pondered this non sequitur for a moment and followed her along the rotting track.

Best Served Cold
By Charlette Poisonsilk

Everyone is capable of Amazing Good and Great Evil...

An extremely old Frontacian exits a bar onto a dark road.
  
Looking up into the sky, he thinks to himself, "The game went much later then usual.  Wife is going to be very angry tonight.  I had better hurry."  He turns and hurries down the road.
  
Stopping quick he sneers,  "Since when have I been worried about what she thinks?"
  
He starts walking again but much slower this time.  "Just think of all the things I've done in my life.  All the battles I've seen.  All the villages I've burnt.  All the families I've destroyed.  And I'm worried about an old woman waiting at home?"
  
He ponders a bit, looks up into the sky and then quickens his pace again.
  
Turning right into a dark alley, he starts again, "Who does she think she is?"
  
His hands naturally fly up to his temples as he is suddenly blinded by intense pain.  He falls to his knees.  He hears the skittering of feet behind him.  Turning to look, he sees no one there.  He recognizes the pain.  He's felt it more times during his long life then he'd like to remember.  But its been so long since the last time he felt it.
  
In the past his instincts would have kicked in and he wouldn't be thinking a thing now.  But his instincts have failed him.  He feels lost.  He yells, "BLAST OLD AGE".
  
The pain hits him again and he is knocked to the ground.  He hears soft footsteps coming toward him.  He rolls over on his back, looks up and can't believe his eyes.  The last thought he has before the last blast of pain hits him is, "I must be seeing things."

 An Anthian walks up to the door of Maxen's trading post and tentatively looks in.  "You'd think I would get use to this but somehow it just doesn't get any easier.  Well I have a job to do."  As he enters the trading post and gets further from the door, the light from the sun fades and the roof looms over him almost seeming to heat the air and push it down on him.  He forces a smile onto his face, nods at who he assumes is Maxen and drops a pile of assorted pelts on to the counter.
 
 As Maxen starts sorting through the pile of pelts the Anthian says, "I heard there was a murder down the street last night."
  
Maxen slowly looks up at the Anthian and says, "Murder?  I'm sure I'd have heard about a murder."  He scratches his head.  "Ah, your talking about that old Dakaris.  Ah, naa sir.  I'm sure it was just his time."
  
"Well that is strange.  I've heard others talk of it as if it were murder."

"You shouldn't listen to towns talk as truth, sir.  You know that minds get to wondering and the next thing you know its all fact.  They think just because he and his wife died on the same night means there has to be foul play.  They were just two very old people.  It's actually kinda romantic, when I think about it."

 Maxen hands the Anthian a neat pile of coins.  The Anthian nods at Maxen, turns and quickly makes his way to the door.  As he approaches the door he gets an over powering feeling that he had been underwater a long time and needs air very badly.  He breaks through the doorway with great relief and takes a deep breath.  He looks up into the sky and remembers what a wonderful color blue is.  And then he winces.
  
"I did it again.  We never even talked price and here I am outside with a handful of coins.  Well, there are better ways to make money then selling pelts."

Spur on 2 Silver, part 2.
By Frason Dranco

Welcome, gentle readers, to the 2nd installment as to how to get the most out of your Spurian trip with as little coinage as possible.

This installment we will deal with the three sections of Spur that could be termed 'limited appeal'. Temples, Guilds, and the like that while indispensable to the more adventure bound, just doesn't have that zang for the common Joe/Jane.

As a side note, the 'star' system I used last time will be absent from this installment. This is due to a lot of these areas' use and general 'Gee, I like that being there' feeling  will depend a lot on the person. For a Cleric, they'd see the Temples as 5 stars. A Dragon wouldn't enjoy it as much, aside from a convent place for a bonfire.

Guild District:

Standing tall north of the Town Central is the central nexus for all the outstanding Guilds that are supported in this city. Going through the gate to the north you are surrounded by four buildings. Each one has or had a task.

Everyone from the Mages to the Fighters, to Bard Aspirants (guild not accepting new members as of this writing) to sailors have at least an office in this district. If it's official and sanctioned trade of our region, it has a branch office here.

Training can be indulged for most professions in this area as well, as almost every guild here has training facilities for ready use from their members. While inter-guild training isn't a common-place thing, for the adventurous spirits in mind, for added fees they will train non-guild members in their arts.

Being the business and professional head of the city, protection of the area is 2nd too none. Almost no criminal activities are based in this district, and any committed will usually be from various thugs and muggers following their mark in.

Temple District:

Ah, the warm basking glow of the faithful. The heated debates concerning the celestial unknown, and the smell of brewing jihads. You can have it all in this quaint South Western corner of Spur.

The temples themselves are moderately sized houses for each sanctified god of Spur. The outer decor is a tad standardized for the region, but the inside of the temples vary wildly dependent on the gods taste.

Here, the clergy of Spur work within their individual gods direction. Members of the clergy and roving clerics may seek training in their god's house, and commoners can come and pay their respects, or spit on the altar of gods they don't particular like(note: Author is not liable for any damages resulting from Divine's Thuds).

As a side note, only 'local' gods have(to the author's knowledge) sanctified temples within the walls of Spur. Worshippers of more...eccentric religions must fend for their own right. The temples of Set and Taath are considered 'sanctified' in this matter, having publicly known temples that haven't been asked to leave for years, though public and political opinion might differ.

Noble District:
(This should have appeared in the first part of Spur on two Silver, due to time constraints[read: Lazy author]it was not included, but is put here now for your enjoyment)

The Noble District is a strip of housing that lay south of the Spurian Town Square. It is also the best place the gawk at people more well off then you will ever be.

Accented by both the local park and the best Inn in the region, this district is the obvious set-down for the up and up. While in most respects one of the most prized areas in the city, it's also used as a major way into the Southern areas of the Spurian Region, which makes random acts of crime a possibility.

On a side road is the famous 'Haunted House'. There has been reports of undead and other nasty things roaming the inside for longer then this writer has been around the city. The casual visitor to our city is not recommended to try and explore the house, unless they are a skill combatant.

The Dark That Heals
(Author unknown)

A soft, beleaguered wail pierced the still air of the Poor Quarter as the sun began to set.  It began as nothing but a low drone, and rose in pitch until it became a keening sob of sorrow.  After a moment, another voice joined it, just as quiet and agonized-then another, and another, ringing through the empty streets in a chorus of heart-wrenching mourning.  The cries rose from out of the shadows, in the corners and gutters of the quarter, springing from voices whose bodies were slouched in darkened doorways or huddled against the grime-coated walls outside.                
                
A disease was plaguing the city, had plagued it for months.  It overtook anyone and anything it could reach, destroying even those who had always, normally, been strong and healthy.  It was a pestilence which cut short young lives, stamped out old ones, but was always cruelly slow and gradual in its methods.  Most often it seemed to strike the poor of the city.  Many were left dead, and more scarred by some horrifying mark or another.  The wails rising through the streets this evening were in mourning for both.                
                
Beneath the grim cacophony of noise, a single, muffled weeping sound stumbled its way brokenly over the rough cobblestones.  Darkness upon darkness, its hunched, sobbing source was at first almost indiscernible from the shadows which surrounded it.  It quavered against the blackness which seemed to cloak its tiny form, and if there were any onlookers to the scene, they may have picked up snatches of the words forming from within the inky veil...                
                
"Mama..."                
                
"Mama...Papa...?"                
                
These repeated several times, in a quiet whisper, but growing in panic each time the words were spoken.  Gradually, tremulously, the slight form separated itself from the shadows, moving slowly and weakly, as one touched by great illness or great terror.                
                
A pale, cold shiver of the evening sun fell upon the human child's face as she crawled out from amidst the darkness.  The uncaring light lent itself sadly to her features, gleaming off a sallow face lined with the tracks of too-fresh tears, harshly accenting the sunken edges of her bones, dully touching a head of long, dark brown hair which must have once shimmered brightly, but was now limp and lacking any sheen at all.  She was dressed in threadbare rags, several sizes too large for such a skinny girl.  A child perhaps eight years old, she looked not a day beyond six.  Her thin, trembling lips parted and the near-desperate words whispered out again, hoarse and weak as they met the stale air.  "Mama?  I...I can't see anything, mama...please..."  A pair of midnight black eyes shifted about frantically, wide with fright as their owner realized that they filtered in nothing but darkness.  All around the poor creature, the dreadful laments of the mourners rose up and cut harshly through the air.  She shuddered slightly, frowning, unable to detect the sound of her mother's voice among the rest.  The wailing cries rose in volume, exaggerated to unbearable proportions in the ears of the fear-stricken child.  She whirled in confusion, greeted by nothing but the harrowing blackness at every turn.                
                
Even in blindness, or perhaps especially, there are sensations of vertigo.  In her confusion and dizziness, in her fear, her knees buckled beneath her.  She fell, but her legs did not scrape against the pavement.  The child fell upon something soft and recently warm, which gave no sound beneath her but the rustling of clammy fabric against cooling flesh.  It smelled of death.  Fearfully, she felt about with her hands,  grasping for anything to identify with.  She briefly took hold of something, clenched it a moment, and recoiled in horror as she recognized the feeling of a human wrist.  Something clattered nearby.  The girl started, biting her lower lip to keep from crying out.  Reaching out with a trembling hand, she traced over the cobblestones for whatever had fallen.  Her fingers found a cold metallic chain, small and delicate, with a flat plated charm of some sort attached.  She picked it up and held it in her palms, tracing over it with her thumb, and suddenly gasped.  Somehow she could trace the initials engraved into the face of the charm-she moaned with grief and dismay to recognize them as her mother's.  A silver bracelet, given to her mother on her wedding day, all that remained of whatever meager treasures she might have claimed in her short life.  Flinging the charm away bitterly, tears welling up in her sightless eyes, the little girl buried her face in her hands and knelt, weeping, over the still form of her mother, taken by the disease as she had slept in the night.  A wave of anguish washed over the orphaned child-for orphaned she was, her father lying lifeless mere feet away from her mother-and she slumped against the corpse and cried herself to sleep, her tears silent and unheard, drowned out by the pitiful wails which continued to arise all around her.                
                
* * * * * *                
                
Echoes.  Not real sounds, no words spoken directly to her.  Echoes fell upon her ears, shivering off of cold walls in a wide, empty room.  She saw none of it, but felt it all.                
                
"Where did you find her?" The first voice was female-shaking slightly with age and infirmity, but still commanding, in an almost otherworldly way.                
                
"Alone in the slums, poor creature, clinging to her mother as though she were still alive.  The girl was the last we found, all the others have been evacuated...or buried." This voice was deeper, richer, that of a young man, probably.                
                
"And this one has no family?"                
                
"None.  As far as we can tell, her mother and father both passed away during the night, as the child slept.  We saw no brothers or sisters there...if she had any, they've already been taken."                
                
"Nothing to identify her with?"                
                
"No, I'm afraid not...all of them were dressed in the rags such as we found her in, and not a coin on them, much less identifying marks of any sort.  They must have been beggars."                
                
"Beggars, yes...she will fit in well here, then.  We take care of our own."                
                
"I understand."                
                
The words passed over the little girl, hung in the air around her, pounding dully against her mind as her consciousness returned.  She sat up rather quickly, about to cry out to her mother.  In an instant she felt a presence at her side, the powerful presence of the man she had heard speak.  He was gentle, now, more so than before.                
                
"Why, look who has finally decided to join us!"  There was a smile in his voice, with the hint of one trying to console the inconsolable.                
                
"Wh...where am I?" the child asked uneasily.                
                
"Look around you, child...don't you see the altar?  The shape of the room? The tapestries?  You are in the Temple of Lord Set."                
                
All was lost to the girl after the words "don't you see?".  She stared straight ahead, her lower lip quivering a little, her eyes focused on nothing at all.                
                
From across the room, the first voice she had heard spoke up once more.  "The disease which has afflicted our city has many unpredictable effects, Glenron...Some of those lucky-or unlucky-enough to survive the scourge have come away wishing they had not.  Sometimes death is preferable to a life of paralysis, or blindness."                
            
Beside the girl, the man who had spoken-Glenron-fell silent.  The little child could feel his eyes uneasily upon her, but he said nothing more.            
            
"What is your name, child?"  It was the first time the old woman had addressed her directly.            
            
The little girl grew tense.  "I...they...I don't remember what they called me."            
            
There was a pause.  In a soft undertone the woman murmured, "The illness has taken parts of her memory as well...what shall we call her, Glenron?"        
        
Glenron seemed to ponder a moment, and the child felt a gentle hand beneath her chin, tilting her face towards what must have been the light.  He spoke softly, as though expecting the girl would not hear him.    
    
"Listen to her voice, Cresia...quiet, soft as the edge of a shadow, it is...as though it is not her speaking at all, as though she is murmuring only the echoes of things spoken elsewhere." He spoke a bit louder, directing his words to the girl.  "Echo...how do you like that name, child?"    
    
The girl sat motionless for a moment, then a strange smile crept across her face.  "Echo..." she nodded, and her dark unseeing eyes flickered in the shadowy torchlight.    
    
The warmth of Glenron's touch left her as he drew his hand away, replaced by the slightly colder feel of a woman's old, frail, but oddly powerful grip upon her shoulder.    
    
"Kneel then, Echo, my child, and know your new lord.  Today you begin your life anew, a servant of Set.  In his shadow you will find your light, the sanctuary of vision through Him which your life has taken from you.  Kneel, and indebt yourself to the mercy He has shown you."    
    
Driven by a force beyond the touch of the old woman, Echo knelt.  A heavy cloth was draped over her shoulders, soft and supple, the dark robes of a young priestess.  For a moment Echo tensed, then relaxed again, somehow at home in this foreign garb.  The shadows washed over her, and she smiled once more.

Ritnall Babblen
By Lobos Fangbury

Let's see, where do I start?  I spent the last 3 years in the bottom lockout jail.  Never heard of it?  Yeah, well that's kinda the point, besides the Oog-ra guards and the other prisoners, not many know of the place.  It must've been designed as a store room, I think for wines and such, because of the solid walls and heavy doors.  Anyway, after a couple years of good behavior I was moved into one of the larger cells there, it was 4' X 4'.  It was a real big upgrade, I actually had a cell in which I was able to lie down to sleep.  Shortly after the move, I found out the guards had a hidden motive behind their good nature to me.

They must've had this plan since the beginning, cause I was busted on some smuggling job that no self respecting go-blin-al would've been caught doing.  At first, when I was moved to the larger cell, I thought finally, this gobbie's luck is changing for the better.  And I thought that till lunch.

Being a gobbie in jail is not a good thing, most the "neighborhood" consists of larger and uglier races.  Starting day one, some huge Thugian came up to me, and began making an unready unpleasant life worse.  Anytime that we'd be allowed in the practice yard, or at lunch, he'd be there, threatening and cursing and spitting.  Then, one of the guards spoke his first words to me, well I think it was a he, not sure, them Oog-ras all look alike.  Um, where was I?  Oh yeah, he/she said, "Me and clubbers stop stoopid Thug eef ya do clubbers favorz."  Well I'm no fool, I learned within the first week of imprisonment to never agree, unless you know what you are agreeing to.  So I asked this "enlightened" guard what he/she was talking about.

The guard stood there staring at me, and I repeated myself thinking the hair in his/her ears was blocking my voice, but before I could finish, the guard turned away.  Thinking I might have offended the guard (not a good thing to do if you plan to live out your sentence) I began to worry, and pace my large cell.  I heard grunting from the hallways and knew the guard was returning, carrying something heavy.  If I had felt fear before, I felt disaster now.

On my first day in the jail, I saw what they did to "disappointing reformers".  They had tied a prison mate to the floor and brought in a heavy lead cannon ball.  First they would grease the ball in whale blubber, then they would form a circle above the prisoner.  Gently, one guard would through the cannon ball to the other guard, and they would catch it and throw it back a little harder, and so on and so on.  Now if they were quick and nimble Oog-ras they would continue to catch the cannon ball till one threw it so hard it killed the other guard, but how many nimble Oog-ras are out there.  What happened was one guard would drop the ball, splintering or breaking a bone of the lying prisoner, pick it up, and continue the game.  In a position like that, you can only hope for the ball to land on your head, ending it quick.  Um, where was I?  Oh yeah....

Anyway, I heard a guard coming down the hall to my cell, grunting as if carrying a large weight.  I nearly jumped out of my beautiful green skin when the guard came into view.  Surprisingly, there wasn't any cannon ball, but a large iron chest.  Furrowing my brow, not only at the guard, but at the situation as well, I felt the immense fear drain out of me, being replaced by an avid curiosity.  The guard carefully set the chest within reach of my cell and laid a thin needle on top of it and grunted, "Clubbers no lix lox."  It took me a moment to realize what the guard meant was that they didn't like locks.

Taking a closer look at the chest, I could spot off right away the simplicity of the lock.  Any of my bloodline could have easily opened that lock, without the use of the crude shaped picklock on top of it.  But the first rule my Papa taught me was, "If it looks hard, they pay more!"  So I worked on the chest for a good ten minutes, just poking at the lock with the pick.  When I felt it was time to end the suspense, I got down to business.  A quick jerk to the left, rotate, and ta da!  A click answered the opening of the lid, but before it was so much as an inch open, the guard that brought the chest grabbed my head and shoved me far back into my cell.

The greed on the Oog-ra's face was so evident that I knew my words would go unheard.  Because of that, I didn't bother mentioning to the guard that the chest might still have a trap on it, but instead whispered a prayer to Set that it did.  Now the good thing about being a gobbie is, Set loves you, and he shows you his love.  That day he showed me his love by having that chest trapped with a fear web.  

You should have seen the sudden look of stupefaction as the guard realized it's error.  Believing the worst, the guard jumped straight back with a bellow of such ferocity that I had felt the teeth in me jaws shake.  I must've made some sort of noise, for then the guard gave me it's undivided attention, and that's quite an accomplishment for an Oog.  As I stared into the usually clear eyes of my guard, I had a deep chillin' feeling that I might be see'in da big coin purse in the sky that day.  As brave as my kin line is, I knew if my Papa was in my spot, he would also feel that quake deep down in the belly linings.  But at the point, a whisper from the bottomless recesses of my intellect forced upon me the realization that the noise from the guard was no longer an animalistic howl, but a whimper one would expect from battered Flerian.  It seems that the fear web had struck my guard right in the back as it faced me.

Well, in two seconds flat, I picked the lock to my cell and was running down the hallway to where I thought the entrance might be.  I looked quickly into every room I passed, most where cells smaller than the one I had just left.  I had also passed a kitchen, mess hall, and a big empty room with nothing but bare shelves.  Then I ran into a dead end.  Surely by this time the fear web would have faded away and an angry Oog-ra would be looking for me.

Now I don't mean to brag, but I always was the smartest in me family, and I always think best on my feet.  I figured I could have stayed hidden in the big empty room, there were enough shadows, but eventually I would have to come out.  No way I could have stayed hidden in the mess hall, it's my personnel belief that Oog-ras spend at least five hours a day eating, and one would've seen me sooner or later.  That left the kitchen or the smaller cells.  Well, I had my share of cells, so I darted back to the kitchen.

Three steps into the kitchen and I suddenly knew how the "Clubbers" handled the bothersome Thugian, as well as the secret ingredient in the "Big Bashem Soup".  Well, if I was one to believe in justifiable homicide, the Thugian fit the case.  Taking a quick survey of the contents of the room I knew my choices from this point were very limited.  To call this room a kitchen, is taking the definition of the word a bit far.  All that was in here was meat hooks punched into the walls, a big fire pit and cauldron in the middle, and an array of wooden bowls and cups on the side of the room.  Then I noticed how bright the room was compared to the rest of the prison. That kinda drew my attention to the hole in the ceiling over the cauldron.  I wondered why I didn't think that they would need a hole to let the smoke out, but figured that's the kind of overlook you make when you see your bully skinned and butchered.  Oh well.

Using the meat hooks, I made my way upward and crawled through the hole.  My first breath of free air in three years, and I couldn't get enough of it, but didn't have the time.   Knowing that I was located somewhere south of Spur, I made my way north as fast as I could.  In a few short hours I was crossing the rogue fields and back into business.  The pickings were good, lots of new faces around carrying a good amount of money and this is where I stayed for the next couple months.

Unfortunately, stolen money has a way of slipping away. Whenever I would get some, I would have to spend it as soon as possible.  So in two months time, I found myself living in the poor quarter, looking for a way out of the thieving game and for a way into retirement.  Even though I was a guaranteed bachelor, I felt it was time to settle down.  That's when I got my chance.

Waiting outside the "Anything Goes Club" for patrons that hadn't spent all their money on the services provided indoors, I was approached by a tall figure dressed in the deepest black robe.  In a voice that was barely more than a whisper, the figure offered to give me 1 million silver to have a trinket stolen from a webhold of some Arachnian.  Well, one million silver is plenty for a go-blin-al of my stature to retire on so I pressed farther for details.

Now, see if you can understand this.  This "gentleman" was offering to pay me that much money and all I had to do were steal some kind of axe from a spider named Lobos.  There was three reasons I accepted.  One, the money.  Two, it was an executioner's axe, and that's how my pa left this great world for the next, so any way I could strike back at them, was reason enough.  And three, the money.  In addition, the mista offering me all this money, assured that the spider wouldn't even be at the webhold, that he'd be in some of those games sanctioned by the gov'nor.

Seeing how this was supposed to be a cake walk, there was nothing I could do but accept, and accept I did.  My sponsor gave me directions to find the webhold, and I had my good set of picks with me, so I was able to head straight there.  So with one last prayer to Set, I stealthily moved into the Arachnian posting hall.  

I had to take a deep breath as I gazed upon the immense room with it's massive webs.  An eerie feeling had crept over me as I stared at the blood-stained tiles.  From the tunnel on the right side, muffled screams and thumps could be heard.  I took a closer look and saw the name Dreammaster etched into a stone above the tunnel.

I assured myself that I had enough sight-seeing and moved quickly to the web in the corner, next to a large pile of ashes.  I spotted a bit of gold in those ashes and, well, money is money so I took it.  It looked to be some kind of collar and had a single word written upon it.  Taco.  I was beginning to think maybe all dese spiders were a bit looney, and with that thought I pulled down the webbing that concealed the entrance to Lobos' webhold.

Right behind the webbing stood a large iron door with a big L imprinted on it.  Me being the trustworthy fella that I am I examined the door.  To my surprise there was no lock and I couldn't detect the faintest hint of a trap.  Well my pa always told me a fool is born or hatched every minute.  And right after he would say that my ma would say something like "Don't take the boys hope away."  I never did understand my ma.

But anyways, if'n the spider didn't want to lock his door, I certainly had no complaints.  Pushing the door open, I entered a big room carved straight from stone.  Immediately I scanned the room for my treasure.  The most obvious items in the room were pale white silken bags.  I guessed they would probably be spider chairs, seeing how they couldn't sit like normal folk.  Clearing this room, I pushed onto the next room, which in itself was almost enough to scare me away.

It seemed like a torture chamber and that's what I thought it was before I saw the  blood runnels on the table leading to surrounding bowls.  Also located on the table were straps, positioned so that they could just as easily hold down a big meal, as to a small one.  To my left were large vats made from ice lizard hides, and each vat was filled to the rim with a deep red liquid.  On my right side was the largest array of blades I ever laid my eyes on.  All of them sparkled as if just washed and eager to be used again.  Not many lived to see an Arachnian kitchen and tell about it.

It was at that point that I knew, no matter how much I was being paid, it wasn't too much.  I had to force myself to think about retiring to shuffle to the next room.  In it were hundreds of vials and containers.  Some of the liquids there were bubbling, some were glowing, some were changing from liquid to gas and back again right before my eyes.  The walls were overwhelmed by shelves.  And each shelf was filled to the maximum with boxes containing different minerals, vegetables, and in some gory cases, animal.

I thought to myself how long games actually are, and figured if I didn't hurry, I'd never see my million silver.  With that I took a deep breath and plunged into the next room.  In the center of the room was the biggest web I ever saw.  At the bottom of the web were bones from hundreds of animals and some that were easily identified as not being from an animal.  In front of all those bones I saw what I had come here for, a blood-stained executioner's axe.  I picked it up and turned around to leave this entrapment of death when I saw my sponsor standing in the doorway.

My first feeling was that he didn't think I was competent enough to steal an axe.  My second feeling was a mixture of curiosity and fear as I watched my sponsor fall to his knees, blood pouring from his mouth, and land dead in front of me.  Without looking up I knew that there was a new figure standing in the doorway.  I'll admit, at first I didn't move because of the sheer terror of the situation, but after I gathered my wits, the reason I didn't move was because I didn't want to attract any unwanted attention.  The final reason I didn't move was because the web that hit me full force across my upper body.

Knowing the trouble I was in and how that this situation may turn out, I began to pray to Set, and for the first time in all my years, Set didn't listen.  As my prayers went unheard, Lobos had picked me up and brought me back to the kitchen.  I was strapped down nice and snug.  After the first bites from Lobos, death was very peaceful, almost like sleeping.  I just laid there singing songs my pa taught me while my blood left me from the various puncture wounds on my body.  It became very dark then, and soon the darkness pressed in.

Next thing I had felt like I was falling.  When I opened my eyes that's when I saw you Mort.  Now what's this you want me to do?  Choose a name?  Well I already know my name.  It's Ritnall Babblen........

The Wolf Dance
By Konichiwa Arigato

To the east. Far to the east of here. Perhaps not so far a place as some, but certainly a distance from the places we gather. It lies across ways of stone, through ancient gates of black iron. And there it has always been. It is a place of savagery. But of greater importance, it is a place of mystery. For there among stones and sand and ready spears is the tree..

The tree is like none other. It is big, oh yes, quite large. But many trees can make that claim. This one is special. The bark, for those fortunate enough to know, is said to be rough with bristles, yet smooth in one direction. And in the rarest of cases, those who have pressed an ear against this hallowed and most sacred wonder are rumored to hear a low growl. This tree, as you might expect, is magickal. And it is proof of it's own unique nature. For this tree appears only at one time. Night, by the light of the moon. Especially the full moon.

It is the source of their power, those who know of it and it's ways. They know the tree, well in fact. Were they not bound by vows and silenced by rite and ritual, they could likely tell you of it. For as has been said before, it has always been there and its history is long, stretching far into the misty past beyond times forgotten. And for much of that time, they have been there as well. They care for the tree. They worship it. And they dance..

The drums find the rhythm first, and the dancers follow, but soon those crude instruments are left behind and forgotten. They are not needed. The true cadence of the dance comes from within, the sound of their own heartbeat loud in their ears. And as they move to the rhythm, the tempo increases of it's own accord. Rising as if to meet the lonely moon high in the clear night sky. Heels strike the hard-packed ground in unison, and they whirl. Each step perfect in its own right, and all of them complete in the presence of each other.

The dancers howl their greeting to the night, the wild, to the world around them. Their cries echo through the cool night air, ringing loudly in their own ears. They are heard, and clearly so, for the wolves answer. Their own call joins that of the dancers, and weaves within it. The sounds mix with one another and blend to a single wordless harmony. The light of the moon shines down on them through the branches of the tree. And it speaks of its approval to their hearts.

Their cries silenced, the music of the eve to be carried now only by the wolves. It was time for the ritual now, and the ancient words of the chant sprang to their lips nearly faster than they could speak them, such was the urgency. The tree bathed them in its own light, the circle thrummed with power. And the dancers reveled in it; but such power comes at a price, and this price could not be avoided. The tree, for as much as it was magickal, was also alive. And it must of necessity be fed.

But even so, the tree is faithful to its followers. The sacrifice arrived as it always did. One from outside the circle. A man ignorant of the danger to him, and innocent of his own acts as they lead him to his peril. The dancers greet him with enthusiasm. Scarcely has he time to even wonder for the cause as death flies to him, borne on points of spears. And as his life's blood flows into the soil, the tree drinks it's fill.

The ritual is now complete, and tired as so few other things can make them, the dancers file off. Their spears laid down or aside, or in the cases of the most energetic, taken with them to be cleaned. The soft and final cries of their victim repeating unheard behind them. And as they leave, so too does the tree. Fading silently into the night as faintly shimmering miasma of light. Dispersing to the air and the sky, perhaps to join more of its kind among the stars. And as the shimmer fades, a second marks the passage of another being. A man of wisdom and some power of his own. And the lingering spirit of the tree's victim calls out to him, begging for his wisdom and assistance.

"What did I do wrong?"

Forbidden

"Follow your star, for if in all
of the sweet life I saw one truth shine clearly,
you cannot miss your glorious arrival.

And had I lived to do what I meant to do,
I would have cheered and seconded your work,
observing Heaven so well disposed toward you.

But that ungrateful and malignant stock 
that came down from Fiesole of old
and still smacks of the mountain and the rock,

for your good works will be your enemy.
And there is cause; the sweet fig is not meant
to bear its fruit beside the bitter sorb-tree.

Even the old adage calls them blind,
and envious, proud, and avaricious people:
see that you root their customs from your mind.

It is written in your stars, and will come to pass,
that your honours shall make both sides hunger for you:
but the goat shall never reach to crop that grass."

-Ser Brunetto Latino, from Dante Aligieri's Inferno (Divine Comedy)

~~~

He was one agile monk.  Jynn's movements were like wind songs in the air, cutting through leaves like they were silk.  His long powerful arms were good assets to him as weapons- he was a hand cleric.  His shaved head revealed a peculiar kind of masculinity that was intangible.

Faenza's eyes strayed from his rune-scrolls.  Shaking his head, he gave his mind a mental slap and returned to his scrolls.  Jynn's hands moving swiftly through the air made swooshing sounds that drew his concentration like sirens.  Angry, he rushed to the window to close the blinds, but upon looking up, realized that he had attracted Jynn's attention as well.  The blinds shut close and he returned to his books.

"If I turn this rune around and,..."  Faenza's mouth contorted in various ways, his mind analyzing and trying to channel a new spell he was trying to learn.  Suddenly, his ears caught sound of the creak of his door.  His eyes fluttered open, and to his surprise, just as he saw Jynn come through the door as stealthily as he could, his channeling magick turned on him and jolted him from his stance.  He fell to the ground, choking, coughing.

"Are you alright?"  Jynn rushed to his side and checked his pulse.  Faenza was still in shock from two events that he had not calculated into his schedule that day.  Jynn sat Faenza up, concentrated his internal energy into his hands and forced it into Faenza, causing him to cough out blood.  It was the only way, since he had been hurt by some rune-power.

"Thanks," Faenza whispered weakly.  "I..."

"Don't worry about it,"  the muscular being whispered back, and laid him on a nearby bed, leaving him to rest before he left the room.  The air smelled of soft ginger, a gentle caress of simple herbs.  Faenza was thrown into a whirling dream and just as Jynn left the room, he fell into a deep rejuvenating sleep.

The next day was the same as before, only that Faenza knew that Jynn knew that he was watching.  This time, Jynn took the careful effort to remove his shirt, revealing new curves and contours.  Faenza blushed and tried to look down from the window, to no avail, for that day, the being came through his door just as he was going to cast a spell, interrupting his flow of thoughts.

"Hope I am not disturbing you,"  a voice came from behind him.  This time, Faenza knew better than to stop in the middle of channeling, but dispelled the still dancing runes and turned back, facing Jynn.

Faenza smiled, "Of course not, I was wondering.."

Jynn cut him off with a "sssh" and closed the door behind him.  Looking around, he found the window and closed it as well.  He turned back to Faenza, his face lit by candlelight, his mouth gesturing in slow motion,  "I know you want me."

Faenza froze.  What did this man mean?  He was a hand cleric- he had nothing to lose.  Faenza, on the other hand, was a heart cleric and devoting himself to his god, took vows of celibacy.  Surely, Jynn knew even before he asked, but when Jynn took Faenza's body in his arms, and when his lips touched his own, he knew that his future would be thrown into a different route than what he could imagine.

"INSOLENT FOOLS!"  the elders of the council stormed unanimously.  How scandalous it was for a member of the class to break his vows, especially such a sacred one passed down from generations of purifying the clerical devotion.  Younger monks held Faenza to the ground, on his knees, with Jynn on his side.

The leader of the hand clerics whispered to the other members of the council and the other elders nodded in agreement.  It was decided that the separate classes would punish their disciples accordingly.  Jynn, though not breaking any vows, would be punished on the basis of tempting a fellow monk to a promiscuous and sinful life.

Faenza pleaded with his high priest for mercy, but his fate was sealed.  Since he could not be expelled from the clerical class, he would be chained in a dungeon, given minimal to eat and living like the rat that he was, no one was to speak to him.  He would be forgotten like the phantom that he was.

~~~

Faenza's eyes looked up with a tear rolling down the crook of his nose.  The past was painful to remember, but even more painful to narrate to a fellow human being.  It was strange how he remembered the consonants and vowels- perhaps speaking to the skulls around him had not been such a bad idea.  He tried to look into Yolanda's eyes but his tears smeared the image before him into a thousand pieces of shattered glass.  He beckoned Yolanda to come closer, and with his hands chained to the wall behind him, he conjured a variation of the sleep dart he learned back in his youth and subdued the young priestess; his powers had become more powerful than he had imagined.

Using his feet, he pressed his dirt-covered soles to her chest, and closing his eyes, he forced his internal energy into her, channeling all his skills into the young priestess.  He was a dead being even before they had chained him, and it was senseless to keep such powers with himself alone.  Draining all but only the necessary energy from himself, he sagged in his bondage and fell into a trance.

It must have been a dream, for Yolanda could not remember what had happened.  She opened her eyes and saw a dead monk in front of her.  She shrieked.  She got to her feet, and felt his neck- he still had a pulse.  She raised her hands to conjure up a healing rune, but to her surprise, a giant leaf enveloped the being- how did she conjure up this rune?- and awakened him.  She pulled at the chains grasping his wrists, and to her surprise, the chains came apart easily.  She looked at her hands and detected a runespell on them- she had cast a spell, yet another spell she did not know of.

"I made them myself,"  Faenza grinned.  "Impressed?"

Yolanda helped the man walk up the steps of the dungeon.  The light was too blinding for Faenza, and see conjured a giant umbrella to shade them.  It amazed her how she could not only make up such impressive illusions, but also how useful these illusions were.  Her eyes met his, and before he spoke, she nodded and brought her toward the townsquare.  She sat him down at the spectator seatings.  The sun was hot, and the illusory umbrella shaded him even though it seemed like its glare pierced through the man.  He looked around, searching for a familiar face, when he saw him.  He was alive.  Jynn.

Jynn's body was more prosperous than people would expect- he was, after all, the chief monk of a secular sect of clerics.  Faenza asked a spectator next to himself who that man would be.  The information was abundant:  Jynn of the Torrid sect had been banished from the main hand clerics for reasons.  Enraged, he formed his own sect in the woods, attracting non- mainstream clerics, gypsies and other powerful beings.  His sect is one of the most influential clerical bodies, and the odds of winning the "class of the clerics" was high.  Faenza looked up at a flying banner.  "Clash of the Clerics," it announced.  The times must have changed tremendously since he had been imprisoned.

Yolanda returned to her heart clerics.  A friend had reserved a seat for her and this was a highlight for the class- their high priestess would be challenging the other sects to a "clash."  If they won, they would win the title as the most influential group in the lands.  Around her, Yolanda could spot clerics from all the different areas- Native Anthians, snobbish and proud, sitting high on their seats; Hidden Hithuals that slouched to the ground, seeking refuge from the earth; the famous Secians that fluttered in their seats, emitting high pitched giggles every now and then.

The clash was beginning.  In different areas of the battleground, priests were fighting priests- hands were fighting swords, maces were bashing spears, runes were striking at armor.  Suddenly, the heart clerics shrieked in unison- their high priestess was pinned to the ground.  Yolanda, moved with anger, leapt to her rescue and with a punch, severed the pinning pole into two.  The high priestess was still choking as two of her disciples helped her off the stage.  

Very soon, it was apparent Yolanda was the center of attention.  Her pink satin dress was apparently not made for battle- no armor!  Still, she was too agile for even the Leuian hand clerics and made her way to a one-to-one combat with a sword cleric.  She raised her hands to the air, while dodging the swordplay of a most-famous clan.  To the surprise of the crowd, a giant serpent unfurled from thin air and coiled itself around him.  He collapsed, writhing in spasmodic shiver.

Was he breathing?  Was he alive?  The audience gasped at the stunning sight.  Yolanda rushed to his aid, not realizing what she had done, and laid hands on him.  He recovered, still very much unconscious, but alive.  The crowd roared.  Today was discovered a new hero-  no, heroine.

Jynn sat frozen at his seat.  He knew- Faenza was alive.  No other genius could have come up with such a magnificent serpent.  He remembered their nights of solitude-  Faenza would conjure up all sorts of creatures, each more amusing than the previous.  He was alive.  

His wife's hand touched his arm.  "Are you alright, love?"  she asked.  Jynn nodded.  He was fine.

Killing list - Fallen Justice
By Soulstar Sunflare

Chade pulled the curtains away from the window and peered out them toward Town Square.  The chaos Set was causing there was still very amusing to him and he could not help but laugh.  Only moments after the death of Ceriana had thunder rolled through the city and snakes begin to rain down everywhere.  Anyone who was in the streets was fighting the snakes, and they were only recently beginning to win against them.

Chade was not sure how many had been killed by the snakes but, he did know that one person who died out there in TS had died permanently.  He had found the second target on his list while passing through there to get back to his room and had decided not to wait till he had to find the target again.  Instead, he had grabbed one of his five remaining fangs, ran back to TS, and stabbed his target in the midst of all the fighting.

Chade sighed and walked away from the window.  Now, however, he had to figure out how to lure one specific Justice into a trap.  He wasn't good at being noticed by the law.  In fact, he specialized in just the opposite.  All he could do was hope his luck would last long enough to finish this assignment.

He sighed again and stripped off his disguise.  He folded up his cloths and set them in the drawer, set his armor against the wall by the window, and set his sword on top of the end table beside the bed.  After making sure he could reach his sword if he needed too, he crawled into bed and hoped for a quite day.  He started dreaming of his wife instead:


Vinessa brushed her lips across Chade's before turning and strolling into the back room.

"I'm going to go soak in the tub, dear," she called over her shoulder.

"Ahhh, not going to invite me along?" Chade asked with a laugh.

Vinessa stuck her head out the back room and made a face at Chade.  She blew a kiss to him before going back into the room and climbing into the heated tub.  Chade walked over to the window and peered up at the moon, calculating the time.  There was still an hour or so before the sun would rise, and he knew Vinessa loved to take long baths, so he decided that he was going to take a short walk.

"Love," he called over his shoulder while looking down at the road that run under the window, "I'm going to go for a......"

"A what, sweetheart?" Vinessa asked with most of her head underwater.

"Odd, there's a crowd forming under our window," he said, instead of finishing his earlier sentence.

Vinessa splashed a little in the tub and asked, slightly worried, "What kind of crowd?"

Chade stared out the window at the still growing crowd, trying to figure out who was down there.

"I can't tell, dear.  It looks like a few Fronties, a Thug or two, and maybe a Monit," replied, "Those are just the ones under our window.  The others are pretty much of every race, and likely just here to watch.  What though, I don't know."

Vinessa walked up beside Chade, a towel covering her slender form, and look down at crowd.  Vinessa gasped at the sight of the Frontacians and Chade put his arm around her instinctively.

"What's wrong, honey?" he asked.

"You remember that Frontie I tortured to death at our wedding ceremony?" she asked him.  When he nodded, she continued to explain, "Well, that's his family.  They've probably come to take revenge or something."

Vinessa turned from the window and went back into the back room.  Chade continued looking down at the group of Frontacians and saw one finally look up to their window.

"Give us the wench," the one who looked called.

Chade ignored them and turned from the window to donned his diamond studded leather armor.  Vinessa had already redressed and put her armor on.  Now she was simply strapping her swordbelt on and loosening the sword in it's scabbard.  Chade did the same for his throwing daggers, then headed toward the door.

"It looks as though we'll just have to kill them all," he said with a wicked grin and stepped through the doorway.  Vinessa returned the grin and followed only a step behind.

They both stopped at the front door to draw their weapons, then stepped out onto the road.  Immediately the were both hit with confusion webs and fear darts, which dropped them both to the ground, immobilized.  The of the Frontacians motioned to the Thugians and they rushed over to pick up Chade by both arms and detain him.

"You two hold him.  Do not let him escape you.  We will deal with him after we deal with the wench," said the leader.  He then motioned to a couple of his friends to pick up Vinessa and hold her.

"You, Muat," he said while walking up to face Vinessa, "have killed my son, and for that you will pay.  You will pay indeed, with your miserable life."

With that the leader turned away and runes started spinning around the heads of all the Frontacians.  Vinessa knew which spells were coming.  She knew that they would be the weakest fire spells possible, the fire dart, simply to torture her.  And she knew there was nothing she could do to stop it with the confusion web still on her.

The darts hit only a second later, one after the other, scorching her body.  Then a fire fist hit her square in the face and she screamed out in agony.  Finally the spells dissipated, but the two Frontacians who were holding her up did not drop her.  Instead they hoisted her up even more and dragged her over to the Monitanian who had been standing ready off to her right the entire time.

In the Monitanian's hand was held a huge battle axe.  Chade watched in horror as the axe was lifted and swung down to connect with Vinessa's necking, completely detaching her head from her body.  Chade screamed and drained the life out of one of the Thugians holding him, who fell dead beside him, then leaped at the Frontacian leader.  Three confusion webs hit Chade before he was half way to the leader and he fell flat on his face.

"Kill him," the leader said as he picked up Vinessa's head and walked toward Town Square.

Chade closed his mind to everything and blacked out as rune spell after rune spell decimated him.


Chade woke with a start and in a cold sweat.  He reached for his sword out of reflex and looked about the room frantically.  Then he remembered where he was and sighed.  He looked out the window and saw that the sun had just gone down.  With another sigh, he crawled out of bed and put on his San Elf disguise again.

Once outside he peered around and walked toward TS.  On his way he started hearing some commotion from Justice lane and decided to check it out.  In front of the Jail house stood the Justice that was to be his next target, Ordeal.

Chade stood in the shadows out of habit, watching the Justice, and trying to figure out how to get it's attention.  He watched a Secian flutter about only five feet above the ground and suddenly had an idea.  He walked over to the Secian nonchalantly and touched it on the shoulder, draining it of all it's energy.  Then he looked up at Ordeal.

"Hey Justice Ordeal," he called as he impaled the Secian on his bastard-sword.

Ordeal turned to Chade and blanched at the sight of the death Secian being waved about on the end of a bastard-sword.

"Chade Daggerfall, you are under arrest," he began to say until Chade flipped him off and ran up the road, laughing.

Ordeal growled and transed after Chade.  He appeared beside the executioners block, exactly where Chade should have been.  He looked around a bit confused until something grinned evil at him from the shadows.  He searched the room immediately, but found nothing.  Blinking in confusion, he searched again, with the same results.

"Having problems Justice," came a voice from the left.

Ordeal ran after the voice, and searched the rooms on the way, but could not find Chade.

"You'll never catch me at this rate," came the voice again, from the north this time.

Ordeal followed the voice cautiously and found himself almost tripping into a pit.  He stepped back quickly and looked around.  Something smiled at him from across the pit and Ordeal tried searching the room again.  Finding nothing, and believing that Chade had gone south, Ordeal spun around just in time to see a fang being rammed into his throat.

Chade laughed as the Justice gurgled and fell backward into the pit.  He turned suddenly at the sound of people coming up the road behind him.  He slipped into the shadows just in time to watch a large group of enraged Dragons flow into the room and see the dead Justice.

Chade returned to the Gilded Lion Inn, quite satisfied in his work so far.  He went up to his room, planning to look over his list and see who his next target was going to be.  He pulled open the drawer the list was hidden in and moved the cloths that were on top of it to find that it was no longer there.

"What in the name of Death.....," he said, startled.

Chade searched the other drawers, his backpack, and the entire room frantically, yet could not find it.

"By Rinanni's vile will, it's been stolen," he said with a sigh.

The Promise
By Khatmandu Snaggletooth

The wizened old man stumbled to the edge of the fountain, cradling his staff in the nook of his arm while dipping his hand into the water. Sluicing the dust from his face, he leaned on his staff and absently traced his fingers along one of the runes carved into the smooth wood. With a sigh, he sat on the edge of the fountain and smiled to himself as he eyed the people gathered in Town Square to gossip and form groups for training or hunting. He watched as a young Flerian thief attempted to lighten the purse of an unsuspecting thug barbarian who was tearing at a piece of jerky. The Flerian yelped in surprise as she was grasped by the shoulder and spun about to face the stern gaze of the fierce-looking Hithual Knight.
 
Shaking his head at the audacity of youth, he reached into a pouch at his side and fished out a skewer of rabbit meat. Pulling off a couple of chunks, he whistled and a black wolf limped slowly towards him from the menagerie of familiars and pets left to occupy the square. Tossing the first chunk into the air, he popped the second into his mouth and chewed. The wolf caught the other and gobbled it down while the old man fondly scratched him between the ears. The wolf licked the old man's fingers and curled up at his feet, resting his snout on the man's boots.

"Ah, Nadle.. Tis good to be back in Spur. Our sojourn back home was needed, but I miss this place.. no where else do all the races jumble together so." He cocked his head, eyeing the fountain. "Things have changed here, I see.. the arch is gone. Still can't seem to get rid of that blade though.." 

Several people were glancing at the old man, speculating on his purpose here in Spur. One bold drag-al sauntered up to sit beside the old man, pulling out a mandolin and strumming a few chords while tuning. "You have the look of a traveler who has seen much, sirrah. What brings you to our city? Running from the Pagans in Saldaea? Chaos Lords?" she arched one brow and looked the old man over.

"Aye, I have seen much in my travels since I was last in Spur. As for what brings me here.." he paused, stroking his beard and choosing his words carefully. "I have returned to fulfill a promise I made long ago. But first.. do Spurians still offer hospitality for a tale well told? I feel the need to sit by a fire and sip a mug of fine Hithual ale, and I fancy there are those who would find my story worthy of a mug or three.."

"Aye, even with the events of the past few weeks, we have not forgotten common courtesy here." the drag-al slung her mandolin over her shoulder and called to a group of her friends. "To the Rose, friends! The human is a storyteller!" An excited murmur skittered through the crowd, a Secian squealing in delight and clapping her hands together in a staccato burst of joy. Several runes began to dance around in the air as people translocated to gain a better seat in the tavern. A pale Psycian concentrated briefly and sent the message out to all who could  receive his thoughts of the event.

The old man settled by the fire, his staff leaning against the back of the chair. Sipping from his mug and wiping the foam from his beard with a practiced pass of one sleeve, the old man sighed contentedly and gazed into the fire and mumbled something under his breath. "Lass, ye seem ta be of a bardic nature, play a tune on that there mandy-lin while I tell the tale I have in mind. Music always helps set the mood.." He leaned over and whispered something in the drag-al's ear and she nodded slowly. 

"Many a tale has been told of battles won and lost, of terror and of joy, of love and of hate." He looked over his crowd, watching as all talking slowly died out and all eyes and ears turned to him. Taking another sip from his mug, he fixed his gaze on a young Leuian before continuing. "This tale weaves all these threads into its telling." The drag-al began to play softly, her notes underscoring the words of the tale.

"There was a time in Spur when the muatana-al roamed freely at night, feeding on the luckless and the foolhardy. One of the most evil, most cunning of the muats was Gemaedan. He realized that there would always be beings of the lesser races who would be willing to serve in exchange for power. Soon he ruled Spur by night, and his underlings were the law by day. The citizens gradually lost hope as one hero or group after another was broken or disappeared as soon as they challenged Gemaedan's grip of fear on the collective hearts of Spur. As soon as the sun began to slide from the sky, many Spurians would barricade themselves in their homes, or in one of the Temples in hopes of being spared. The bazaar was deserted by day, the mugs in the taverns grew dusty. Spur yearned for a hero...

Mewn stood on the bow of the ship, the salty spray dampening his silvery white fur. He watched as the dolphins frolicked in the wake of the ship's passing, each moment bringing him and his family closer to Spur. The White Lady had come to him in a dream, telling him his skills as a healer were needed in this town. He touched the mark of Rinanni on his brow and murmured a quiet prayer to her. He heard the cabin door open, and turned to see his son, Ciradu, peek his head out.

"Poppa, momma says for you to come eat with us!"

Chuckling to himself, Mewn whistled and held out his arm for the white raven perched with wings outspread on the bowsprit. "Harmony, she will be upset if you are not at the table with us." The bird chirruped once and flew to land on Mewn's wrist. Together they ducked inside the cabin. Taking a moment to let his eyes adjust to the dimmer light inside the room, Mewn felt his mouth water as the aroma of spiced fish tickled his nose. "Mmm... smells like you have outdone yourself, kha'tia. This trip seems to have improved your skills in the kitchen!" He leaned over and nuzzled the black-furred figure setting the bowl of fish on the table.

She nuzzled him back, purring softly and swishing her tail. "That is because your mother would never let me cook back in Leuia, you know there is nothing wrong with my cooking abilities, a bit rusty perhaps.." She placed a bowl of rice next to the fish, and Ciradu scampered from seat to seat with the plates and utensils. "Go see what is keeping your sister, khit. Probably spying on the sailors again, dreaming of the one moon." The female sighed with exasperation. "Quatoka is growing up too quickly, Mewn. All those Rinanni rituals."

Mewn laughed. "Of course all those Odarian tales of battle and of rescuing fair damsels had nothing to do with it, Kyrana. She is our khit after all." Mewn took his place at the table as his two children dashed in, Quatoka batting her paw against the back of her brother's head. "Embarrassed you again, kit'gia? What did he do this time? Tell one of the sailors about your momma's prowess with a blade?" Mewn's eyes sparkled with laughter.

"Worse, father! He told Jadr I like him!" The young girl whined at him. "He will never talk with me now!" Quatoka pouted. 

"Little dove, it will not matter after tomorrow. I spotted Spur in the distance today. I figure by this time tomorrow we will be in our new home."

All was forgotten in that moment, Mewn's family mused on what Spur would hold for them and planned to discover every exciting secret the town had to offer.

Their ship. WaveCleaver, pulled into port along side another ship bearing no name, but flying a black flag with two red eyes weeping blood. Mewn felt a chill trickle down his spine, the eyes seemed to be staring at him and judging his worth. Kyrana slipped his arm over her shoulder and wrapped her tail around his waist. She fiddled with the pommel of the broadsword buckled to her belt as Teluki, her battle cat, rubbed the side of his head against her leg. Harmony had already taken to the wing, soaring over the city to the Temple of Rinanni bearing Mewn's letter of intent to the High Priest there. The khits were sitting on the bowsprit pointing out interesting sites to each other.

"Not as lively as a Leuian port, kha'tia. Only a few merchants looking to buy or ship cargo that I can see. Nor is there the usual crowd of shady characters waiting to part a sailor from his coins. And that ship.. I have never seen such a banner, yet here in this harbor there are at least 3 others under the same flag." Mewn said as he absently ran his claws through Kyrana's mane.

Kyrana purred softly in his ear, her eyes closed as she enjoyed the moment of closeness. "Sounds to me like an Orderly city.. only those who need to be here are allowed on the docks. And the flag is probably a merchant's. I imagine he thinks pirates will avoid his ships with such a distasteful banner." She sighed contentedly. "I just hope I can find work somewhere. Odarous and his tithes can weight heavy on a body."

"And on my pouch!" Mewn ducked and danced out of the reach of Kyrana. 

"Oh, you... you.. MALE!" Kyrana yelled in mock fury, the corners of her mouth twitching into a grin despite her best efforts. She pounced on him and started to tickle him into repentance. "For a kiss Odarous will forgive ye, sinner!"

 Mewn happily paid his penance.

Mewn spent the next couple of days settling into the routine of the Temple, while Kyrana found a small cottage and searched for work. The khits would spend their days playing with other children of various races in Town Square and their nights sitting by the fire learning the stories and ways of their people. Kyrana soon found steady work with a frontacian runemage as a hired sword. She would be gone for days at a time, or only return for a few hours before heading off on another expedition, but she never failed to bring a gift for the khits or shower Mewn with affection.

Mewn requested to serve the Temple as a healer, just as Rinanni had intended. The High Priestess, Loquacious, was grateful for the help. The careworn Secian was almost at the point of despair. The wounded and dead streaming into the temple for help had shaken her faith and sapped her will. The empathic nature of her race had become a curse, all she felt was the fear and distrust that had come to dominate the psyche of Spurians. Mewn's presence was like a balm to Loquacious, soon his quiet confidence and light-hearted manner had revived the spirits of many followers of Rinanni.

Shortly after the arrival of Mewn and his family, Gemaedan's grip on the city was almost complete. His minions gleefully relayed tales of minor race wars and small riots breaking out during the day, one enterprising San had even started paying for 'slaves', poor souls who would soon be delivered to Gemaedan and his brethren to feast on. The folk of Spur were restless and nearly broken.

Mewn sensed the underlying current of uneasiness, but assumed this was due to the myriad of races that inhabited Spur. The Frontacians quarreled with the Psycians, the San with the fir and the Usil, and the Arachnians with everyone. Several times his gifts as a healer had been called upon. Loquacious thought so highly of Mewn's skill and his way with people that he asked Mewn to minister to the injured who inevitably stumbled into the center of town.

It was here Mewn began to hear the whispers about Gemaedan and his followers. As a khit he had heard stories of the muatana-al, but had never truly believed all that was said of them. Seeing the fear behind the eyes of some of the people he saw made him begin to believe. He saw several people each day who seemed to be drained of their vitality, or corpses that were nothing more than shriveled husks of skin and bone that the day before had been full of life and spirit. He tended the wounds of the body, and ministered to the ones of the spirit as best he could. With a reassuring touch here and a kind word there, Mewn began to undo some of the damage Gemaedan had done. Ciradu and Quatoka spent more and more time helping their father in the square, helping with bandages or lifting spirits where they could. Soon other people began to bring their children to the Square, to warily renew ties to friends and neighbors.

Little by little the work Mewn and his khits did began to heal the disquiet in the Spurian populous. At first there was no indication of this other than friends smiling at each other instead of furtively looking over their shoulders, or the increase of children's laughter as they played their games in the square, or the handful of extra shoppers in the bazaar. Gemaedan noticed his grip over the people slipping and set his pawns to investigate. Soon shadowy cloaked figures were fanning out in the streets, seeking the root of the problem.

Gemaedan plotted the removal of this latest pest, savoring the thoughts of how he would crush the people's hopes that much more with Mewn's death. He would hang the khits from the arch just because the image pleased him so. He only hoped to see Mewn's mate before she died from grief. Perhaps an offering to Taath would be in order, once her will to live had been sapped by the deaths of Mewn and the khits she would almost embrace the release of sacrifice, Gemaedan thought. He clapped his leathery hands and rubbed them together, the dry, whispery sound punctuating his diabolic chuckle.

Mewn watched as Kyrana oiled her blade, preparing for another trip to the southlands to protect the runemage and his apprentice from the beasts within. She placed the sword in it's worn sheath, and reached over the bed to grab her pack. He pulled her close, wrapping his tail around hers as he kissed her. A low, throaty purr filled the air as the pair embraced, the forgotten pack tumbling to the floor, soon joined by Mewn's robes and Kyrana's leathers.

Smiling softly to himself and still smelling the scent of Kyrana, Mewn walked slowly into the Square, his staff clacking against the stones and Harmony perched on his shoulder. He noticed the glances people gave him, not the usual smile or handshake greeting he received. Some people simply ignored him. He was just pondering the absence of children in the Square when he saw it. Someone had crucified several doves, nailing their bodies to the Arch. There was one still alive. Mewn gingerly pulled the nails from the wings of the feebly struggling bird, while calling upon the healing runeweave. Just as the aura encompassed the dove, Mewn felt a shiver run down his spine as a low, mirthless chuckle filled the Square. Mewn spun around and saw a lithe Sanene leaning on the Arch opposite him, a bemused smirk on his face.

"I see Leuians still have not lost that trait of eating live flesh, eh?" The Sanene spat on the ground and winked at Mewn, dropping a handful of nails absently to the flagstones. The priest trembled with rage, his vow to uphold peace the only thing keeping his claws and runes still. The dark-robed elf sauntered across the Square, the smirk melting into a sneer as a pair of runes on his forearms started to glow. He ripped one dove down and dropped the limp body to the ground, the wings still pinned to the Arch. As the dove's lifeless body thumped on the ground, the San winked out of sight.

A sibilant voice whispered next to Mewn's ear "Taath's vulture will feast on Rinanni's dove...." Harmony squawked and fluttered up to the top of the Arch as the evil cackle slowly faded from the Square. One nervous anthian edged close to Mewn, stammering as he spoke. "Th..that is M.m..m..Mubata,  Ge..g..gemad..d..dan's right h..hand. You ha..have be..been warned." Mewn stared out over the crowd, the dove in his paws fluttered into the air and flew straight for Rinanni's temple.

All that day, Mewn could not escape the feeling something was watching him. The shadow that glimmered at the edge of his vision, the whisper just under the drone of the crowd, the eyes that glanced away from him as he found them in the crowd. How many were Mubata's cohorts, how many were curious, how many were just his imagination? Mewn paid close attention to each man Quatoka flirted with, to each person watching Ciradu play with his toy soldiers. There was no doubt in his mind which Gods his children would devote themselves to when they came of age.

As they walked home just before sunset, Mewn's hackles stood up straight. Something was near, something malicious. Scanning the nearly empty road, he could see nothing out of the ordinary, nothing to account for the tingling of danger he felt. Just then a shadow   flowed down the street. Glancing up into the sky, he noticed a vulture, the setting sun glimmering off something metallic around it's neck.

Cursing under his breath, Mewn linked his mind with Harmony's and asked his friend to fly to the cottage to see if anything unpleasant awaited. Harmony preened one wing, then cocked her head at Mewn, touching his mind briefly, the reassurance brushing over him like a feather. With a screech for the khits, she flew up into the air and glided off.

"Kit'gias, we might have to stay in the Inn tonight, or even perhaps my Temple. When we get home, pack some things for a short stay away." Mewn patted both khits on the head affectionately, trying to keep his growing apprehension from showing. He could see from the flicker of worry that darted between the glances both children shared with each other that he was not successful.

The vulture shadowed them all the way back to the cottage, causing Mewn's tail to swish in agitation. Several times he considered invoking a sleep dart, or a more direct killing weave at the vulture, but he could not bring himself to harm an innocent creature. "It is only a tool, it knows not what it does, " he mumbled to himself. His edginess was rubbing off on Ciradu, his son was continually flexing and retracting his claws. Quatoka scratched absently at the runemarks on her arms.

Harmony was resting contentedly on her perch by the fire, nothing was amiss at the cottage. Breathing a sigh of relief, Mewn leaned in the doorway and watched the vulture as it settled into the branches of a tree across the lane. He called over his shoulder, reminding Ciradu and Quatoka to pack light. As he turned to resume his vigil, he saw the vulture slowly fade from sight.

From the concealment of the shadows, Mubata chuckled to himself, his vulture perched once more on his shoulder. "Well done, Ebon. I will allow you to feast on the raven." Slinking behind the building, Mubata grasped the dull silver chain around his neck and found the obsidian fang attached to it. As he caressed the fang, it glowed and several runes began circling his head. Fixing his mind on the image of Gemaedan, he sent his message. A moment later, he shivered and let out a soft gasp as he was answered.

Petting the vulture, the dark elf slithered back into a position he could watch the house. He glanced up at the sky, noticing that there was no moon to betray his movements. Mewn was staring up into the sky as well, his thoughts lost in the beauty of the stars and Kyrana. Mubata grinned evilly and settled in to await the appointed time. "Enjoy the sight, priest. You will not live to see tomorrow's, " Mubata whispered to the shadows.

Mewn set the three packs by the door, ready to grab on the way out at the first sign of trouble. He could hear Quatoka humming idly to herself as she fixed a quick meal for the three of them. A smile creeped across his face as he realized how like her mother she was. Ciradu had dressed in the set of soft leathers his mother had given him on his last name day, and belted the long dagger Mewn had given him the same day to his waist. The young khat smiled slightly at his father, then sat down at the table. Mewn did not miss the fact that his son chose the chair that gave him the best view of the front door instead of his normal place that would have put his back to it. Mewn sighed as he sat down, wishing Kyrana was here.

Shortly after dinner, Mewn and the khits shouldered their packs and headed out the door, after Mewn checked for the vulture or anything out of place. They hurried off to the Lion, moving quietly through the shadows. Mewn's hackles stood on end, his senses telling him they were watched, but his eyes and ears were unable to find the shadow that flowed down the street...

Mubata cursed and nearly went after the three when he saw them leave the house, looking as if they were looking to disappear. He waited until they had traveled down the street a few houses before stalking after them. Several times Mewn turned to look over his shoulder, but his searching eyes never found Mubata cloaked in the shadows. When they entered the Gilded Lion, Mubata smiled and sent Ebon hunting for a rat in the park. He rubbed his fang again, sending the new location to his master.

Mewn and the khits were settled in their cottage, the innkeeper giving them the Water Cottage. Quatoka immediately settled into the bath, while Ciradu used the second bedroom to read his Odarian histories. Mewn locked the door and kneeled beside the bed, offering on last prayer to Rinanni before collapsing wearily onto the bed. Listening to his daughter's singing as she soaked in the tub soon had him relaxed, his mind drifting. He closed his eyes to think of Kyrana, and was soon fast asleep.

Mewn awoke with a start, there was a muffled shout and the sounds of a scuffle coming from the other bedroom. Rolling out of bed quickly, he yelled for his khits and bolted for their room. Harmony darted ahead, screeching in anger. As Mewn skidded into the room, he saw his son guarding the slumped-over body of his daughter. Ciradu's dagger was bloodied, and his leathers torn in several places. One dark-cloaked figure lay sprawled on the bed, his sightless eyes staring at Mewn. 

Ciradu was panting heavily, and a sword of crackling energy was slashing at him. Three of the remaining five attackers turned and advanced on Mewn, Ciradu yelling for his father to heal Quatoka.

The runes were already glowing on his arms, dancing around his head as they formed the glowing white dove that sped straight and true to circle over his daughter. Pure white tendrils of light cascaded down to envelope Quatoka briefly, fading even as they touched her. When they were gone, her eyes fluttered briefly and she seemed to stir.

Mewn's next runespell circled his son, giving him some much needed energy. But he could do no more for them, for the three were upon him. Two brandished dully gleaming broadswords, while the third drew back the hood on his cloak, revealing Mubata's evil grin as runes slithered up through his robes to spin over his head.

The runes formed glowing black tendrils that lashed out and enveloped Mewn, burning his fur and melting into his flesh. He cried out in pain and invoked a runespell, causing his fists to begin to glow and smoke with white-hot light. Twisting to avoid the swords, Mewn stole a glance at his children. Quatoka was laying her hands on her brother's chest, his broken dagger laying useless on the ground as he lashed out with his claws, calling on Odarous for strength.

Mewn's spell smashed into the San mage, causing his robe to smolder. The web of acid continued to eat into his flesh, and Mewn had taken several small wounds from the swords, he could feel his life trickling down his side with each beat of his heart. He danced back away from the swordsmen and sat down to call on Rinanni's power to heal him.

Quatoka cried out in dismay, Ciradu had slumped to the ground, overcome by his wounds. She was cocooned in the fibrous strands of a spider's web, helpless. Mewn cursed and called upon dark magic, the fabric of his soul changing and darkening as he did. A web of sparkling black energy entrapped one of the swordsmen, who stumbled to the ground and writhed in pain. Mubata called out to Taath, and a dark cloud formed over his head.

Mewn raked his claws at the spelled swordsman, ripping through his flesh. The swordsman sighed his last breath and ceased to move. Mubata's runes glowed again and started to dance slowly over his head. Mewn roared in rage and sent his black web at the other fighter, his claws tearing wetly through the man's throat and ending his torment. 

The blood-streaked khat sought to win his way to his khits, but was foiled by the remaining henchmen of Mubata. Calling on Rinanni's favor to replenish his energy, the priest spun his web again to entrap another warrior and easily yanked his weapon out of his pain-wracked hands. When he saw the other figure, cold fingers of fear caressed Mewn's spine.. a Muatana-al.

Mubata's spell exploded on the Leuian, the aura burning away at his flesh. Mewn roared in pain, touching his raven for energy as his next web seared into the Muat's corpse-like flesh. The Muat laughed maniacally and touched Quatoka, who whimpered in pain and seemed to shrink and lose vitality. Mubata uttered a word and his vulture swooped down on Harmony, knocking her to the ground. Mewn leaped at the Muat, slashing his claws and rending deep into the pale flesh. 

Mewn stumbled as pain lanced through him, the bond with Harmony was gone, severed with her death. Mewn's eyes began to cloud and grow dim as his life ebbed from him, but his runes and claws still flew at his two remaining attackers. 

The muat groaned and collapsed to the ground, giving Mewn a thrill of hope. Mubata's runes enveloped the priest and trapped him in a chaotic swirl of sticky tendrils, binding him fast. Mubata chuckled and tended the prone form of the Muat, stopping the flow of blood from the numerous clawmarks. The San gloated for a moment, chuckling softly as his vulture tore the flesh from Harmony's shattered body.

Mewn cursed at the dark elf, struggling fruitlessly in the confines of the spell. His own blood matting in his fur and pooling at his feet. Mubata stood and locked eyes with Mewn, the triumphant smile cutting the Leuian deeper than any sword. 

Mubata whispered and runes danced, Mewn knew no more.....

The old man sighed and took a long pull on his fifth mug of ale. He looked out over his spellbound audience and smiled slightly. The bard's mandolin quiet, waiting for the story to continue. The young leuian's claws were flexing into his legs, almost drawing blood through his leathers. Some folk surreptitiously dabbed tears from their eyes, a Secian wept openly.

"What about Spur's savior? The hero you spoke of? How could Mewn die?," several voices spoke at once. Soon the tavern was a cacophony of questions, all pleading to know more.

The old man held up his hands and motioned for quiet. The bard used the subtle drag-al method of shouting "Hush, people! Let the human speak!". She punctuated this with a gout of flame from her nostrils.

"Friends, this tale is not done, but I need rest before I can finish. Return here tomorra and we will continue." The old man bowed wearily to his audience and settled into his chair. A fir barmaid brought him a fresh mug, and a plate of sandwiches. Me smiled his thanks, and spoke a few words with some of the thankful folk. Several offered gifts, all of which he politely refused.

Soon all that remained in the tavern were the old man, his wolf, and the drag-al bard. "Thank ye for the music, lass. A tale is always more vivid with a song to help the telling." He reached into his pouch and offered her several gold coins. "Could ye do the same tomorra?" He raised an eyebrow and smiled slightly.

"Of course! But ye nae need ta give me coin! Th' tale be all th' payment ye need ta give." She shook her head vigorously, small wisps of smoke curling from her snout. "But I would like ta know what yer business be 'ere in Spur iff'n ye 'as a mind ta tell." She smiled hopefully.

The old man chuckled and shook his head slowly, knowing that somethings could always be counted on. The Dragon's Ego, the Leuian's Courage, the Hithual's Good Cheer, the Secian's Love, and a Drag-al's Curiosity.

"When the tale is done, you will have your answer, lass." With that, the old man took her hand, kissed the back of it and winked. "Good eve to ye." 

The old man slowly stood, brushed away the last crumbs and winked at her, then drifted off out the door, Nadle at his heels.

Mama
By Pokkin

It so lonely, Mama
It so cold,  
I so sorry, Mama
I have told
Lie on lie-
Truthful not,
But pain inside
I have fought;
For save my heart,
For save my soul,
But I too weak
Not reach my goal.
Weep you not, Mama,
I make all better.
Smile you, Mama,
Smile you forever.
I steal you gold, Mama,
I pick you flower,
I make it rain
For you can shower.
You lay down, Mama
I ask why-
Why you die, Mama,
Why you die?
Take all things
I give to you;
Take my life, Mama
Oh, I so blue.
