Greetings, fellow Spurians!

Thanks for picking up the newest issue of the DFC!  I hope you'll all find what we have to offer enjoyable, from several fine stories and poems, to the society column, to the return of the Spurian Top 5's.  I must say that so far I've been pleased with how things are running.  Feel free, as always, to contact me with your questions or comments on the new changes in this neck of the woods.

I'd also like to take a moment, and give everyone a word of advice as Rinannimas fast approaches.  Too often in our city, the citizens value gold and possessions over the lives of their fellows.  Some even go so far as to kill for these material things.  I myself have been on the receiving end of at least two such incidents in the past week.  It makes me sick at heart to see how little regard we have for those we live and deal with in our everyday lives.  I would ask you all, as the season of good will and forgiveness draws near, to take a moment before you act when you feel you've been wronged.  Just a bit of thought and consideration for your neighbors could spare everyone a lot of trouble in the end.

Now that I've finished my babble, I hope you all enjoy this issue.  Keep the material coming!

-Marigold

Society Column
By Esper Esperchan

Hi, and welcome to this edition of the Spur's Society Column, brought to you by the DFC and the Spurian Merchant's Guild.

This week's recitals prepared entries were won by Marigold with the following piece, titled "Lullaby For a Child of Magick."

Close your eyes, my sweetest darling,
Close your eyes, in blissful slumber,
Beneath the wings of flock'ed starlings
Bathed in sunset's temperate umber.
Close your eyes, fall into dreams,
The waking world's not what it seems,
Walk upon a path of stars,
And toss your cares to winds afar.
Soon the midnight dancers rise,
Swirling 'cross a mist-bathed moor;
If you let your heart be hypnotized,
Your soul, set free, will finally soar.
These are the visions of a child,
Love as free as it is mild-
Stealing kisses from the moon,
And as she smiles, so do you swoon.
Between the twilight and the dawn,
There waits eternal bliss
For those who still sing starlight songs
And treasure every murmured wish.
Find your star, and cling to it,
Find its light and sing to it,
Darling, close your dreamer's eyes
And let your dreams be realized...
Rest safe in a valley of peace 'til the dawn shines,
New adventures await with the light of the sun-
But for now fly away, leave your worries behind,
And close your eyes, my dear one.


For the Spur of the Moment competition, the subject was "Families." Solic won with this untitled piece.

From the same blood, same life
come to save each other from strife
Brother or sister, it doesn't matter
For when they're together, it's all laughter
Father with son
Mother with daughter
Intimate relationships all around
and when they're together, everything's allowed
Families around you, and you are in one
Forever bound, forever one.

I'd also like to announce Marigold's appointment as backup MC, in case I can't attend the recitals on some dates. As long as I'm there, she'll be treated as a regular contestant, however.

Thanks for Reading!

Story of a Thugian and a Dragon
By Shanz Ironfeild

A strange man in an even stranger place rides his mount down the winding, muddy road as he feels the storm coming in his bones, and by the way that his mount is acting the horse can sense it as well.  Spying lights ahead he presses his steed on-ward and to beat the on-coming storm.  As he nears the small roadside inn, he tethers his horse in the stables and enters the tavern looking for a place to sit while waiting out the storm.
Studying the room with his intense, piercing gaze, he notices that the room is full except for a single table in the corner of the room.  Sitting at the table is a large dragon nursing a mug of rum, and by the looks of it he has been there quite a while.  

Seeing that there are no other available seats the stranger sits with the dragon.

The dragon, being a very friendly sort, promptly smiles and says with a slightly glazed look in his eyes, "Greetings, m'friend, how be thee on this fine eve?"

The stranger, feeling strongly compelled to respond, answers, "I am well, however slightly bored."

"Ah, but that be a problem easily remedied, m'friend," stated the dragon.  "Might thou be interested in one o' ma' tales?"

"Perhaps, what might it cost me?" inquired the stranger.

"Na'thing more than the time it takes me to fabricate ma' tale," said the dragon.

"Is it fact?" the stranger asked.

"Some o' it, some o' it is na'," answered the dragon.  "Ma' tale begins in a place to the north o' 'ere, to the natives tis' known quite simply as the rogue fields because of the abnormally high number o' disgruntled poor folk.  Ye see, twas a day much like any other for a young secian known as Lukie.  Again, today was na' out-o'-da'-ordinary, she was down in the rogue fields on her way to the lair, or hunting, or healing or some-such-thing when she happened upon a hapless young Thugian known as Nightbringer.  Nightbringer was in a bit o' trouble now, seeing as how a few rogues were beating him senseless.  Lukie, being the healing-inclined Secian she be, immediately started to heal the battered and beaten Thugian.  Howev'r, at this time Lukie was somewhat new at the art o' healing, and her sudden appearance somewhat shocked the abused Nightbringer.  Seeing the dazed expression on the unfortunate Thugian's face, the band o' feral rogues seized advantage o' the opportunity and handed him their sabers and battle axes--pointy and sharp ends first.  Knocked unconscious and then stabbed to death, the slaughtered Nightbringer's corpse seemed to speak from beyond the grave.  It said, "Lukie, on my life and those of my parents, you will pay with your life for my death!".  Lukie, thinking that her job was done, had been gone from the skirmish for many moments already.  Well, word got out through rumors (some thought and still think that they were started by Nightbringer himself) of Nightbringer's oath.  Morrows passed and Akel, Lukie's closest friend,  heard tale o' Nightbringer's plan to end Lukie's life and asked his friends to keep an eye out for this Thugian.  So, one day while one of Akel and Lukie's friends--Vvalz-- was hunting in the fields and came across a Thugian with a mighty familiar name, after a few moments of looking at him Vvalz recognized him as the one who planned Lukie's demise.  After thoroughly interrogating the baffled Nightbringer and convincing him to relate his tale o' the story, Vvalz gave Nightbringer two choices--give up the idea o' killing Lukie, or be killed himself.  O' course the Thugian na' being the brightest race in the world told Vvalz that he would 'ave to kill 'em to ev'n make him think about na' killing Lukie.  This did na' prithee Vvalz at all for he was one o' the few who despised violence.  Though, Nightbringer's choice was made, and the two decided to do battle right 'ere in the fields with the rogues.  The first blow was struck by Nightbringer, for he thought this would be an easy kill to mark under his belt, but Vvalz while na' being agile did 'ave an especially strong suit of training armor which Nightbringer's blows clanged off of without so much as phasing Vvalz.  And like this the battle went on for a long time.  Vvalz with his bastard-sword was hitting the Thugian much more often, but doing less damage than the gigantic greatsword that Nightbringer was wielding effortlessly with one hand.  Though hitting much less often, Nightbringer dealt an enormous amount o' damage when he made contact and penetrated the armor.  Tiring quickly, Vvalz was forced to switch to a large glass battle-axe that he  carried along for jus' such a purpose--when he was tired but did na' want to use magick.  Seeing the battle tipping into his favor, Nightbringer dealt what he thought would be the killing blow to Vvalz's torso, howev'r Vvalz readied his battle-axe much more quickly than expected and parried the blow, shattering the battle-axe into thousands of pieces, each one embedding itself into each o' the contender's bodies.  Both advisories howled in pain and doubled ov'r on the ground.  Getting up by shear force o' will Nightbringer got up, and using both hands on his own blade, gritted his teeth and swung as hard as he could and severed Vvalz's sword arm from his body.  Staring at his arm as it fell off, and the stump o' and arm that he had left gushing blood, Vvalz roared in anger and shock more than pain at the Thugian.  At this time Lukie was coming back from the lair clutching a large diamond 
that Akel had given her when she heard the roar and recognized it as Vvalz's battle-cry.  Almost dropping her diamond in her haste to get to the battle scene to help Vvalz she stumbled out o' the room and looked frantically for her friend, Vvalz.  Upon entering the room she saw the crumpled form o' Vvalz laying on the floor oozing blood by the pint with a huge, now toothless, grinning Thugian standing ov'r top o' Vvalz.  At this sight Lukie promptly picked the pieces o' glass out o' Vvalz's skin and set to work healing him.  Then she did the same for Nightbringer.  After she finished her work, she asked them both for the story and wherefore they were fighting, upon learning the reasons, she scolded them both.  Then she sent Nightbringer on his way and set in on Vvalz, "What's did ya tink yous was doin?!  Yous knows I hates it when peoples hit eachother!" with that she turned and ran out o' the room.  After a few moments of mumbling, grumbling, and cursing on Vvalz's part he heard a faint, high-pitched woman's voice screaming, "no! dat's mine! get your own! hey! help! no! stop hitting mes!", thinking back Vvalz realized that he did na' know how far Nightbringer went Vvalz quickly gathered up his things and set out in search of Lukie.  With the help o' his wolf Vvalz quickly found Nightbringer towering ov'r Lukie holding a that quartz greatsword with one hand and warding Vvalz away while yelling, "one move and the Secian gets it!".  Having some experience with Thugians, Vvalz decided the best way to get Lukie was to confuse the Thugian and grab Lukie quickly.  In reply Vvalz said, "Ifn ye give the Secian to me, I will let thee live, ifn ye do na', I will be forced to kill thou," at this the Thugian laughed.  Seeing that Nightbringer was na' another dumb Thugian, Vvalz made his move and grabbed the bruised Secian off the ground and knocked Nightbringer ov'r.  Noticing that he was na' going to 'ave another chance, and that the winded Thugian was recovering quickly, Vvalz drew a dagger and stabbed him through the abdomen.  Growling in pain Nightbringer slashed at Vvalz with the strength born of both verily strong races and the strength born o' fear.  Catching Vvalz in the leg he howled in pain, while twisting the dagger around in Nightbringer's stomach.  At about this time Lukie came-too and realizing that this was a Thugian who was a verily large threat to society, invoked a sleep dart on Nightbringer.  Seizing the opportunity, much as the rogues had done earlier a few morrows ago, Vvalz used Nightbringer's own blade to end his life.  Taking up the ponderous blade, Vvalz held it high as Lukie whispered a prayer to Odarous.  Waiting until Lukie finished and had turned away, Vvalz brought the blade down swiftly and surely, right into the heart o' the sleeping Thugian, at the verily moment that the deed was done, thunder cracked the sky and a booming baritone voice filled the ears o' Lukie and Vvalz, "Thank you for freeing me from that tortuous prison, my friends.  I have been trapped in there for 25 long years.  Taath, god of the demons, trapped me in there so that I would not interfere with any of his plans that would plunge the Spur into anarchy.  In that form, I was forced to do evil things that are against my nature and beliefs.  But thanks to you, Dragon, and you, Secian.  I have been freed and will be able to prevent Taath from summoning his demon armies from the dark realms in which Taath himself originated.  Fare well, and good luck.".  At this Vvalz snorted and mumbled something about joking Drag-al's with bull-horns, though Lukie took it much more seriously.  She knelt down and started praying to Odarous for a sign o' what she ought to do, but Odarous, being busy as usual, did na' 'ear her.  Verily disliking himself for 'aving to do away with anyone, Vvalz picked up all his belonging as well as Nightbringer and his things, and carried him to the Temple o' Taath.  Insisting that this was a mission o' pity and that he was only there to return a dead body, the Taathian guard still did na' let 'em in.  So Vvalz had to 
talk his way through, and to this day Vvalz still will insist that gold talks much more convincing than any con-artist.  Once inside the temple, Vvalz laid the body of Nightbringer the Thugian upon the alter of Taath.  Mumbling a silent prayer to Taath,only because Deathstalker was a member o' the Taathian community and because it was Taath who would be taking care o' the Thugian.  Tear's choking him, he picked up Lukie, who tagged along, and somberly walked out the door and off into the night...." said the dragon, downing the last of his mug of rum.

"Hmm... and just how much of that is fact and just how much is fiction?" asked the stranger.

"I am na' sure, seeing as how I am only passin' on a story that I heard from ma' friends, but it do make an entertaining story, aye?" said the dragon.

"True, entertaining at the least," replied the stranger.  "Well now, I must be on my way, for you see, the storm has passed and Nightbringer's family has placed a bounty on the head of those who were responcable for his death."

"How much be the bounty?" inquired the dragon.

"100,000 silver pieces," repield the bounty hunter.

At this the dragon chuckled, shrugged and said, "Well, the best o' luck to thee."

The bounty hunter then said in return, "I need not luck, how hard could it be to catch a dragon?!"

"To which direction do thou plan on traveling, m'friend?" asked the dragon.

"To the north," the bounty hunter answered flatly.

"Well, I will na' keep thee from thy journy, be well," the dragon told the bounty hunter.

With that the bounty hunter got up and walked out of the tavern.

As he listened to the horse galloping away the bar maid asked, "More rum, Vvalz?"

"Aye, prithee, m'dear," as he grinned and made plans to go south...

The Power of a Bard
By Allwyn Firestrings

Weaver of Illusions come my way,
and spin a tale of a better day.
Tell me of might and magic,
the victorious and the tragic.
Save love for another night,
my hearts not up to the fight.

Songsmith sing me a song,
don't matter if it's short of long.
Sing of heroes and kings,
and creatures with wings.
Leave the romances alone,
cause I hurt to the bone.

Child of the Muses spin a tale,
while I try to forget in my ale.
Talk of weapons of yesteryear,
and mighty heroes free of fear.
Tell me nothing of the heart,
cause mine's been ripped apart.

Bard, leave nothing in your wake,
and sing away this ache.

 "Simpleness lost in a sea of contradictions.  How easy it is to love and how so very hard it is.  A healing balm or a death stroke in the same place."

Fortune Smiles
By Depravato Anestalon

Twas in the Age of Dissonance
on an isle called K'kree
an empire forged on romance 
and majestic family tree
the monarch wise and kind
revered throughout the land
a crypt most ancient they did find
cast open with tool in hand
and from that tomb released was death
a pestilence fraught gale
the plague surged bout the city
sought out mortal breath
made tangible as slicing steel
the populace dying wail
the court rushed to there sacred liege
a mighty force of mage
afeared the royal line 
would expire in the siege
they tore through tomes most ancient
searched through every page
and upon the favored king they weaved 
an sorcery most high
bound to flesh upon his chest 
a sigil
to avert mortal ability to die
forged to the mystic shape
of his families sacred crest
as they finished there magnificent rune
the plague did sweep through that mage packed room
the monarch wept as the sages 
cried out death's grating tune
the city finally silent
as a necropolis or tomb
his majesty ..with heart wrenched 
in pain fraught remorse
cast off from island home
in an ensorceled boat
dismal in spirit 
he allowed the currents to guide his course
for many a mournful week
his vessel was a-float
till one day water spout
surged from storm like dark god's tower
strait toward ship it commenced 
to tear his craft asunder
shredding the pitiful sloop
in a maelstrom of eldritch power
the high lord sank beneath the waves 
to sounds of violent thunder
and awoke on rock strewn stygian shore
saved from certain death 
by his breasts arcane tattoo
around him a strange people
numbered in the score
his silent host ever watching
as more of them did accrue
without word or kindness
by ruff hands was he seized
carted off to a darkened
sin-tainted sprawling city
and only through his suffering
did his captors seem appeased
and long into hellish night
they showed him torment without pity
come morn..the solemn touch of gracious mercy tender
a gentle servant sent to heal him flesh and soul
he thanked the kindness of
his fair and charitable mender
to fretful sleep he fell
as his body was made whole
and in the dawn again
came torments obscene and foul
and at his writhing pains 
his captors did simply smile
they cherished without leniency
the violence of each keening howl
and the monarch begged for death
against these ministrations most vile
dazed..too weak each night he slumps
days to weeks became the months
and each eve his gracious 
healer would be there
she'd tend to him and grievous wounds
with subtle silent care
she soon learned from him 
his art to communicate
her voice so gentle as and like
the cooing of a dove
and vowed one day to her royal charge
to help make his escape
and from this and many other acts
his soul was bound by love
his unending anguish and
the march of time he did endure
with new found hopes he did gain strength
and his feelings ever deepened
for this lady he did adore
and freedom he knew by her love
would be his salvation at times length
over and again he felt
the tragic march of time
but at long last arrived  
that eagerly yearned for day
she with key unlocked restraints
he tasted freedom most sublime
quickly through palace they did steal
his savior did guide the way
and then with abject horror
noted he the shadows came alive
before he could cry out
by vicious blow was he felled
and awoke upon an altar
his freedom they did deprive
within his heart was heavy
his thoughts of freedom quelled
and then he saw her form
his heart now racing faster
at the sight of her dancing lewdly
to some un-heard ominous score
clad only by blood and wicked smile
the perfect priestess of her master
the last of his hopes fell away
like a knife in his heart it bore
as she cried out in abandon
for her blood gorged god called Taath
he could not believe this her
on there shared love he beseeched
her dance complete she turned to him
her visage filled with wrath
above the king she leaned
let fly with words and screech
"Vile slave do you not see."
'"this was the greatest of them all."
'"that there could be salvation."
'"freedom for your soul."
'"to keep you in strong spirit."
'"blinded in hopes wall."
'"to take from you that instant."
'"was my purpose and my goal."
'"now that you are shattered."
'"we will give you to our lord."
he looked about in horror
hundreds watched in glee with grin
assembled and slowly chanting
as she drew a blood-stained sword
the monarch crushed of will
looked upon the servants of sin
with little hope of compliance
he asked her one last task
that he could die with breast
still bearing symbol of his clan
she looked on him in silence
while donning gods grim mask
she moved to him and altar
mind filled by evil plan
"I cannot concede to your wish."
'"I must have it for my own."
'"a remembrance of your suffering."
with sword, tattoo from chest was carved
with care it was removed
the monarch..weak..released a moan
and he withered to a husk
like a man for long months starved  
and from his breath released was death
a pestilence fraught gale   
trapped within the monarch
dormant since days long past  
kept from ever thriving
by  the courtly mages craft    
freed without the magic
on winds that blew too fast
it whirled about the city
while the dying monarch did but laugh                                                                                                          the city finally silent as a metropolis sized tomb 
and the monarch..eternally.. smiles in that silent city of...
doom.

A Mystery Most Pure- Spekkio Chosenhart

I see a mound,
and am surprised.
For there are three oaks standing,
on it's rise.
I look around,
wondering how this can be.
Not one or two,
but on this rise, Three!
The moonlight does shine,
and illuminates the mound.
And I see fine,
the three oaks that astound.
They seem as one,
but three there be.
This could be much fun,
for a group of fairy.
Fairy I thought,
now this could be.
Three oaks are not normal,
could be the work of fairies.
That would explain, 
why I see three.
They wanted a small grove,
in which to dance free.
Then the moon beam struck,
and I did see.
Under my eyes,
between the trees.
Were dancing,
fast and free.
Many a little people,
it was fairies.
The moon let me see,
what I couldn't before.
In one tree,
was a fairy door.
There was a throne,
between two more.
And in the middle,
a dancing roar.
They mystery I knew,
solved it I did.
From nowhere a clue,
did raise the veil that hid.
The celebration that rose,
from between the three oak.
And the happiness coming from those,
between the three oak.
~
I see a ring,
so bright and green.
On the ground,
in front of me.
Even through,
the dark it seems.
As if twill,
soon break free.
Of the earth,
as if not bound.
Like the rest of,
the grassy ground.
My body tingles,
when I draw close.
Then I realize,
a fairy host.
This is not,
just a ring.
But a door,
of fairy glamour.
It must lead,
to the land fairy.
Then suddenly,
forth do burst.
Little people,
riding many a lil' horse.
They get off,
their little steads.
As some play,
on little reeds.
Sweet music,
does waft by.
Ethearic tis,
makes spirits fly.
They lift their head,
and sing so true.
Their voice many,
not just a few.
With enchanting song,
do they move.
Dancing, swaying, leaping,
this elven throng.
Tis amazing,
to see them true.
Joyous as if,
the world were new.
They worry not,
of death and war.
Or, will last,
the winter's store.
They sing and dance,
happily.
Taking joy in life,
like it should be.
They move with grace,
these delicate ones.
Mothers, fathers,
daughters and sons.
They have grace,
and power I see.
These little ones who,
dance tween the trees.
You may think,
why be merry.
But I will tell you,
it is very,
good to be, 
this way you see.
For watching the Secians,
showed unto me.
The way of life,
is to live happily.
So listen true,
to their heartfilled tune.
And life will be better,
for you soon.
~
Fairies, fairies, everywhere,
dancing through the midnight air.
Singing,
bringing,
magickal fyre.
Dancing,
whirling,
with mystic satyre.
Fun and joy,
rippling forth.
From where they play,
just to the north.
Shapes and lights do they show,
as the dance tell a story.
They float through a ancient bough,
casting forth mystic glamoury.
Sending forth,
near and far.
Happinness,
enchantment,
as from a star.
That lights the way,
of travelers lost.
And guides them from,
death in the frost.
They dance and whirl,
sing merrily.
Joyous sounds from them,
come floating free.
Children of,
the night sky true.
From star they look,
beautiful as the moon.
And with such grace,
do they move.
magickal dance which,
to watch behooves.
They come from power,
and from grace.
They won many wars,
through magickal, this race.
But they are,
as they have always been.
Happy and joyous.
A magickal kin.
Now watch ye close,
and listen true.
And with luck,
they'll dance for you.
See their magick,
in them true.
feel the joy, as they sing and move.
They sing and play,
for all to see.
A joyous,
magickal,
mystery.

The Life of Blrak 
By Blrak Drascek

My earliest memories are of being lost and alone, in a cold, harsh world.  I suppose I was about 3 years old at the time, and I was wandering through to woods alone.  I don't know what happened to my parents; for all I know, they may still be alive somewhere, and think that I'm the one that's dead.  It doesn't matter, though.  To me, they are as good as dead.

As I said, I walked through the forest, homeless, for some time.  I can't remember how long I was alone, but I do remember how I escaped death, and found myself a family.  One day, I heard music in the distance, so I headed towards it.  That day, two very important things happened to me.  I found a home, a circus, and I also learned the importance of not making yourself conspicuous.  I walked into a clearing, and found myself at the back of a large crowd.  A young child, about my age, screamed out as he saw me.  I was frightened to death.  I had suddenly walked out from the lonely forest into a land of giants.  Slowly, the child's screams began to attract the crowd's attention.  As soon as they saw me, they hollered and began to throw rocks at me.  I would have died there, if not for a very kind quick-thinking Drag-al.  He was the ringmaster of the circus, and happened to see what had captured the crowd's attention.  As soon as he saw me, he hollered at the people to stop, and said they were stoning part of his troupe, the world's smallest man!  The crowd had luckily never saw a Go-blin-al before, because they bought the story, and stopped stoning me, and quickly called a healer.  One that day, I had finally found my family. 

I traveled with the circus for years, though I would later be billed as Blrak the Small, and work with the acrobats.  They became my parents, and took me into their house as their son.  They taught me many things, both about acrobatics, and the world in general.  Often we would stay up late at night in our wagon, and I would listen, sitting in bed, and they would tell me of the history of the land we were in. 

They didn't teach me everything I learned, though.  They had asked the rest of the circus if they would help educate me, and they all quickly agreed.  I grew especially fond of the old magician.  He taught me sleight of hand tricks, and we often would merely sit around and talk.  The lion tamer tried to teach me how to befriend animals, but that's one lesson I never really understood.  Those lions always looked like they wanted to eat me.  The clowns taught me how to, well, clown around, and make others laugh at you.  Oh, the
days of the circus.  I loved the circus.  I had a home, a family, and friends, all who loved me.  Little did I know that it would soon be over.

I can remember that night as if it were yesterday.  We were traveling to a small village, as we often were, and had past by a large city only a day earlier.  The night was cloudy, and storms were threatening.  Sometime during the middle of the night, when all were asleep, the raiders attacked.

I don't know who they were, or how many there were.  All I remember of the moments during the beginning of the attack itself was my parents waking me, and telling me to hide.  I knew immediately something was wrong; I had never seen them so worried before.  They told me again to run, and hide, and shoved me off, but not before they handed me something short and heavy.  I looked down, and saw a talon sword in my hands.  They quickly told me to run back to the city we had just passed, and to sell the sword if I needed money.  Then they told me they loved me, and ran into the battle.  Strange, but they had never mentioned that they even owned any weapons, let alone possessed the skill that I saw them fighting with.  They each now had a dagger in hand, and seemed to dance among the raiders, with a path of utter death behind them.  The raiders had greater numbers, and though for the moment it may seem that my parents would be fine, after I looked around, the truth struck at me like a cold needle in my heart.  The raiders' numbers were greater than I had thought.  There was no chance my parents could survive the fight, and they must surely know this.  It only took me a moment to realize that they were buying me time.  

I did not waste that, the final gift they gave me.  I ran off, and did not look back.  As I ran, I heard a scream pierce the night.  Not long after that, another scream shot out, and I stumbled.  My parents, I was sure.  Dead.  I could not turn back and disobey their last order to me, but at the same time I wished I would.  I wished the raiders would catch me and kill me.  I had lost all the family I had ever known, and again I was alone in a cold, dark world.  

The sounds of the small fight offered by our circus began to die off, and I thought of what would happen if one of the raiders had saw me run off.  Somehow, I brought myself back up to my feet.  My parents would not die in vain.  I threw back my head and screamed defiantly at the raiders, and ran.

It was a full day and a half before I reached the city.  Just as it came into view, the storm that had been brewing broke loose.  Walking through the rain, I soon made it to the city gates.  There I stopped.  I looked up at the storm, and collapsed against the gate.  There I sat for hours, and wept.

And that is how I found myself in the Spur.

I feel I should let everyone know that I didn't write this alone.  My raven, the late Raven, or as he liked to be called, The Great Raven God, helped me with much of it.  He was, for a long time, my only friend in the Spur.  He, too, was killed cruelly, but that's a different story.  I just didn't feel right not mentioning him, because, in truth, he wrote most of this story, and I just told him what happened; he's the one that polished it for me, and so I submit this in his honor.  This one's for you, Raven.

30 things NOT to do
By Anzarn Blizzardclaw

#30 - Walk into Town Square Central screaming at the top of your lungs, "I'M NEW HOW DO I PLAY THIS GAME?????"

#29 - Attempt to kill a thief who just picked you, relying on the awesome destructive power of your FIRE DART!

#28 - Burp in the direction of someone with a weapon such as "A two-handed diamond encrusted blade of death".

#27 - Sick your raven on a greater spirit.  (No, really, it can take him!  I swear!)

#26 - Kick, punch, and/or slap people while your PvP is set to ‘off' (Oh no!  There's a bug and suddenly there is no peacebond in TS and my PvP is on!  Yaarrrg!).

#25 - Ask a drooling Thugian if he's eaten dinner.

#24 - Attempt to collect a ‘sample' of webbing from your friendly neighborhood Arachnian.

#23 - Use words such as: "Sucks", "AOL", "computer", "plasma gun", etc., etc.

#22 - Go to the games and complain to the Elders because, for some strange reason, you can't hit anyone.

#21 - Organize a ‘mugging party' of recent TG arrivals to ‘steal people's cool armor and stuff'.  (Honestly, I heard someone say this once.)

#20 - Continue to say "HOW COME I CAN'T RIDE MY DESTRIER?????" in Town Square until someone casts a fire fist at it.

#19 - Practice your level one instrumental skills in Town Square.  This is likely to get you either webbed or beaten senseless by people whose ears have not stopped hurting.  In very rare instances, you might be placed in a jar for observation, or a game of catch.

#18 - Attempt to name yourself any of these: "Homer Simpson", "Michael Jordan", "Al Bundy", or anything with the word "Knox" in it.

#16 - Kick a 2nd stage Dragon to see if he or she is awake.

#15 - Call Thiarin'a a worm.  It tends to be bad when you get clawed for so much damage that you die TWICE.

#14 - Say to a cleric, "Heh Heh, bet you couldn't hit ME with that storm, god boy!"

#13 - For the Secians: Don't fly too close to the mouth of an Oog-ra or Arachnian.  Very, VERY bad.

#12 - Make a water slide out of the vomit from various :cough: Town Square drunks.

#11 - Ask Sordum what a ‘psi bolt' does.

#10 - Ask a Hithual, "Do you have a nickname?  Can I call you ‘stumpy'?  Where are Leaky and Sneezy?"

#9 - Ask a Penthanian if he is related to your stone mail.

#8 - Call a Guide who responds to your assist a "narc".

#7 - Get a custom ‘ten-gallon hat' from a peddler, and walk around saying, "Gee howdy!" and/or "Yee Haw!".

#6 - Walk into a room full of Taathians and say, "I'm a thief.  Can anyone explain what ‘smite' does?"

#5 - For the Thugians: Parrying attacks with your head is a bad thing.

#4 - Try to ‘skin' Jazbo.  Really, go ahead and try.  But remember to tell everyone that you're going to -- it'll be fun to watch.

#3 - Drink a ‘shot of wild turkey' from Thanksgiving.  

#2 - Ask an irritated Elder what a ‘flying death skull' does.

#1 - Use the ‘act' command as a Thugian to eat someone.  :shiver:

The Life of Dravon Soulkill
By Seltin Fortan

Greetings,  I am called Seltin.  A lowly Bard with little power, wealth, or friends.  I have always preferred to wander alone.  Caring for no one but myself until I happened one day to find a cave deep inside a forest.  As it was getting close to evening I saw no reason not to spend the night inside.  I scouted around a bit to make sure that there where no other residents of the cave, finding none I entered.
  
As I entered the cave I felt a tingle running through my body and then I felt a slight shifting sensation.  As my eyes finally focused I found myself standing inside a small cell, inside a Huge cavern with several large doorways. I stared with disbelief at the enormous piles of gold and treasure on the floor beside me.  A small portion of this treasure  would make me rich!  But all this treasure would not do me any good inside this cell.  Being a bard I had picked up some very useful skills in my travels.  So I was confident that I could escape and liberate some of this treasure on the way out.  Looking at the bars of my cell did not raise my hopes any, they where made out of diamond. What kind of creature would use diamond as a building material?" He chuckled at his stupidity,"  Then to my further shock there was no lock, for that matter there was no door!  I readied my only weapon Greysword(a bastard sword handed down through my family for generations) and started to hack at the bars.  
	
After several strokes I heard a sweet little voice say, 'That will do you no good, they are unbreakable until he removes the spell.'
	
"Startled I whirled around and there was the cutest little creature I had ever seen.  She was flying there with a scowl on her face. Barely over 1 foot tall, ruby eyes and blonde hair.  
	
"The small fairy-type person continued,' I told him to get rid of that thing, she said giggling. You'll have to wait till he comes back to be released. ' "
	
"Who will release me, I asked. 
	
" 'Why Dravon of course you silly!' and she fluttered through a door.  "
	
"I thought to myself: Dravon? I sat down racking my brains.  Aha! I suddenly remembered a lecture from one of my many teachers, speaking of a dragon named Dravon, but that story was well over 200 years old. Nothing can live that long or so I thought.  Well since I wasn't going anywhere I layed down to sleep.  I was awakened buy a strange tingling sensation. " 	"Sitting up I heard voices coming from one of the doors.  Then I started to feel a vibration, as if something huge was approaching.  Just then a huge shape entered through one of the doors I drew my sword and prepared to defend my self I heard a deep rumbling laugh. " 
	
"Then I heard a deep throaty voice say 'If I wanted you dead you would be dead already.'  
	
'Dravie be nice!' the tiny voice said.  
	
'All right all right my love but we do have a problem now', the deep throaty voice said."

	
"The shapes started to move forward and a small shape came into the light.  
	
'Hello', she said my name is Balia and this is Dravon.' " 
	
	
"The huge shape moved forward into the light.  I gasped, I had never seen a creature that big, his back and claws as big as my sword.  The most fascinating was his color though he was partially black and partially silver!  As he approached the cell I stammered a hello.  He glared at me intently. 
	
He said 'let me see that sword.' 
	
I unsheathed Greysword  and had brief thoughts of trying to force my way out of the cell.  As I stood there he uttered a few words and I saw runes above his head and then my sword was gone. Instead of being in my hand it had appeared in front of Dravon.  He  started to exam it closely.  
	
'Hmm' he said 'where did you get Greysword from human?'
	
I was stunned, how did he know my swords name? It has been handed down through my family for generations I said. 
	
‘Do you have an ancestor named Rejak?' he asked.
     
‘Why yes he was my one of my ancestors that lived over a long time ago.  How do you know its name?' 	

‘Why I gave it to him of course.'

Here ends the first book of Dravon

The Last Monitanian Fighter in Spur
By Blackcrow Twygg

I am Blackcrow Twygg, the last Monitanian in Spur that follows the straight thin line of a fighter and a Monitanian. Now all you are probably saying that I am not the last fighter in Spur that is of Monitanian roots. I have built myself upon the standards of the one first Monitanian fighters, famous lizard of Spur RCV CEN. He was one of the best at what he did and I was impressed by his mastery of the weapons of his choice and the ability that only fighters have now. The ability to focus our blow. Living as a Monitanian and fighter is very tight life, and then also be the leader of SOR runs me out. Here are few lessons that I have learned that these things are important to Monitanian fighters:

1. When hunting in dark places you as a fighter must take the liberty of holding a torch, if possible make the other lizards jealous with a torch that is a flaming barbarian on a stick (I think I have found one of these on my trips to Monitan, but I lost it on the way back to Spur. I think some creative gobbie made it just for me, if you find one please send it my way)

2. Never kill a novice, this is intolerable by most and seeing that Monitanians all have
great hate for ones that kill others, especially if the one killed has not a chance at all. 

3. Only townie kill or disarm if provoked. I have encountered many a urchin that has said to me, "Why don't you go play in the sewers among your own kind", one stroke of my sword and the urchins head rolled from the poor quarter right into the bank. Sometimes a townsmen see it fit to say, "This weather is only fit for Monitanians" now this is a minor insult so I don't kill them for it, but I do disarm them. Some will also say, "The weather is calm and clear" which pokes fun of how we can not see so great, even in broad daylight, so this will usually mean a death for this townsman.

4. If you see the need to kill a townie clean up after yourself. If you kill a townie than kill the guards that follow, if you can not kill the guards for what ever reason make them follow you as far away from TSC as you can so that no novices get killed.

5. Channeling is your friend, as a fighter you are not supposed to depend on magick. Also as a lizard you are not that intelligent to use magick, which is why I think that fighters that are Monitanians are on the decline. Now seeing that we can not be great at magick the mages guild does give us a few runes that can be implanted, fire, strength, force and armor are few. Some spells that can be weaved are fire dart, fire sword, fire whip, fire mace, fire fist, fire wall, strength aura, and armor aura. Mages guild sees how we fighters have trouble with barbarians once they berserk so they have given us these runes and not given to many to fighters, blending aura and sleep dart are all they get as I hear. The mages guild also trains us better than they train mages, making it so that we have the knowledge to combine runes at lower levels than mages are taught to combine runes at. 

6. Defense against barbarians. Hit them until they go berserk and then you disarm them, this requires many trips to see the trainers which will make you be able to disarm faster. Then you pick up the weapon, now don't keep it! Give it back when they die or give up, now if you die make sure to give it back seeing that Monitanians and fighters hate been stolen from they will not steal from others.

7. Get a good weapon. A weapon makes the fighter at all times, you would not be a
fighter if you only used magick. Now you must keep this weapon from getting broken, try to get an unbreakable one like my unbreakable blue diamond bastard sword, very nice weapon that never breaks. In the case that your good weapon does break get it fixed quick as lizardly possible or you may not have a weapon to use when attacked.

8. Get good mail. Now this is also important to any fighter to preserve his strength for the fight, also this is needed to be unbreakable if possible. I do not have great mail as of yet but I may have some soon. This is even more important than a weapon, no weapon and you can run while your mail absorbs some of the damage you get when they catch up to you. If you have no mail than you will get hit and take full damage which will make you hurt and very dead, very soon. Get a mail that is also does not interfere with your channeling so that you can use your magick against things that you can not hit such as flyers.

9. Sacrifice your strength. This has not been tested yet, not sure if it even works, but is effective against runies if it does. The longest lasting, long pulsing, low damage spell we get is fire whip. When you are against a runie you cast this fire whip on your self than the runie will not be able to get spells through you since a rune combination will not work when a combination of runes are already attacking your target (the fire whip you cast). The fire whip lasts for about 45 seconds which will hurt you for 64 damage which is minor compared to what the runie probably can do in a second to you. Now with this 45 seconds you should be able to get the runie down to half hps or below (the runie will probably cast an armor aura or wood wall on him or herself so that your damage can't get all the way through, but being a fighter and a lizard you will be doing a lot of damage to the runie.

10. Be honorable. Try to talk things out with your enemy before you swing that weapon of yours, once you swing you will make an ever lasting enemy. Don't strip people for possessions or such. If you had your weapon stolen by number 1, then number 1 sells it to number 2, do not kill number 2 offer to by back the weapon for the price that number 1 sold it to number 2 for. Than kill number 1 selling anything you can strip off him until you get your losses back and everyone will break even. 

11. Do not kill for petty little things. If someone takes your saber that you had stolen off a rogue do not get mad for it is only a steel saber and you can kill a rogue anytime you want, but if you feel that you need that saber and have trouble killing a rogue come to me and I will give you 2 sabers, if you prove you can not kill a rogue and were stolen from.

Follow these guidelines and you will become a successful fighter Monitanian leader of SOR that I am. These are not beliefs shared by all or represent the beliefs of Mythic or Dragon's Gate staff or even other fighters.

Secrets and Lies
Guztymne Horawytz

What is more glorifying than an opponent's death cry?  Igor fluttered in the air gracefully, his veins pumping, rushed with adrenaline.  His ugly name only disguised his consistently superior and almost sensual swordplay.  The thin blade saw the last gleaming beams of light as Igor slid it down its sheath.  He landed.  Touching the wretch's face, he snorted.  He reached for the wretch's money pouch and left.

Igor's blue feathers tapered lightly at his neck.  There, his feathers thinned to a fluff of white.  His feathers made him look almost sky-like, if not for his beak. (Editor's note: Anthians have beaks?)  His hooked beak was prominent, more so even to the Anthian race.  His eyes were bloodshot, and that made him even less socially-acceptable.  But in his guild, Igor was known as the sword that slices the air.  It was almost as if his appearance made him all the better in his art.  He could carve demonic designs on his opponents, as a leather-worker intristically etches his emotions.

Igor landed near the bank.  His winded arm reached for the banker, and deposited his coins in silence.  He strolled from the common place of men as they glanced on at him.  His gnarled features pleaded for the attention of the merchants of the circle, but Igor recognized none of it.  His heart was in his art alone.

~~~

Igor sat on a cold stone.  His beak curved into a slow smile as insects flapped their delicate wings around him.  Their wings were different, each unique and for a purpose.  The dragonfly had its strong solid wings, thinner than thinnest paper, to propel its able body through the air like an arrow riding the air.  The bees had their little wings to just lift their furry clumps of hair above the flowertops.  But his favorite was the butterfly.  Each butterfly had its own design, each reflecting the beautiful designs of nature.  Contrary to his seemingly heartless occupation, or his demonic appearance, this pretty insect could fascinate him for hours.  He would trace its path in the air with his blade, ending on a daisy or a blade of grass.

This time, even the butterfly could not get his attention.  He was deep in meditation.  Something was entirely different.  The fabric of nature was somehow disrupted.  He could feel Elindale's inabsence in all this beauty.  What had happened?  Igor could only hope to guess what was happening.  Was he the only one to feel this change?

An unnatural ruffle in the leaves near him startled him and he reached for his sword.  He shouted out for the creature to make know itself, and to his surprise, a humanoid appeared from behind the shadows.  The creature pulled back its hood to reveal a bubbly face of a gnome.  He chanted, and from the numerous herbs and leaves in the satchel at his belt, Igor identified him as an outcast druid.  It was not far from Spur, and Igor wondered how he survived without anyone noticing his presence.

The gnome's incessant chantting stopped.  He lifted his murky yellow eyes up to Igor and said, "Sxdoig Fwpo lo sde oij oisod."

Ironically, Igor's ears were intuned to his language.  He could not translate it into any language he knew, but understood the message.  It also meant that he had to do what he had always promised to do when he was inducted to the Forestor Guild.  The gnome handed him a sealed pouch, and gave him instructions to open it only when the moment had arrived.  Igor began to ask how he would know when the moment is to arrive, but before he could finish, it seemed that his mind opened itself up to the answer.  He was not to know the moment beforehand, but when it arrived, he would be able to complete his destiny instinctively.

The gnome chanted words that had a magickal aura, and melded into the surrounding flora and disappeared.  Igor wondered how such magick could come into the hands of one who was cast out of Spur.  If such magick was to be introduced into the Forester guild, their job of protecting the forest and its creatures would not be such a difficult labor.  Igor glanced at his forearm, and could only cast a few spells, one to heal light injuries, and another in case his sword failed him- if it ever did.  Both were nothing in comparison to the teleporting spell the druid just demonstrated.  Igor sighed in silent admiration as he spread his wings and started toward the sky.  He drew his sword and traced his own path ahead of him.  Near the horizon, his sword pointed at his destination, and he soared toward the farthest stretch of land.

~~~

His feathers, once camouflage against the azure sky, were now like a stain against the orange sky.  His beak and imperfect distortions were at home in this desolate swamp.  He hovered over the slime, bearing his sword like a guide.  Dead branches of lifeless trees cast shadows on the dark swamp.  Still, he followed their opening to a cave, too narrow for his flight.  Disgusted, Igor stepped onto the cleanest stone he could find, and skipped through the jaws of cave.

The cave was dark, and the bioluminescent moss provided just enough light for his infravision eyes.  It is hard to explain the world through an Anthians eyes to a non-Anthian, but it is almost as if they could only detect heat.  Heat energy outlined any object in the dark, even in the coldest nights.  Thus, in that manner, Igor could distinguish walls from openings, menacing boulders from potholes.  Igor's folded wings provided him with just enough comfort in the claustrophobic cave.  When his thoughts ran rampant in fear of the enclosed space, he closed his eyes and kept his thoughts on the warts on the gnome-druid's face.  It was as if in his ugliness did he find solace, find his direction in the mad chaos of the dark cave.

Soon, the moss grew more luscious.  He could detect light as his eyes began to adjust from the heat-detecting vision to normal clarity.  White light beamed through holes in the walls around him.  Suddenly, his passageway ended in a dead end.  Igor's thoughts became tuned to his surroundings, this sudden turn of events causing him to become more alert than ever.  His mind flipped through all the different options he had, and what could have caused this sudden end.  Had he missed a straying track?  No- he would have noticed.  The druid's face appeared in his face again.  Oh- why was this face such sanctuary in this place of death?  Oh!

Igor's mind fit the pieces of the puzzle together- and he saw the light.  He had been tricked!  He had never seen Death's face, but the gnome's face must have been close.  The God had appeared, and tricked him, caused him to be misdirected by his own beliefs.  Feeling around his inventory, he found that same pouch that he got from the gnome, and opened it.  From it, fell a dead butterfly, that drifted slowly to the ground.  Igor felt the walls closing in, and he screamed out as if his lungs were torn from his body...
