Welcome!

We're proud to present you with the first issue of the new year, and it looks like we're off to a good start.  As you'll see, this installment is noticeably thinner than past issues, a change which most people seem to be pushing for.  In days to come, expect to see more of an emphasis on quality writing here.  A quality publication and the satisfaction of our readers is what we're here for in the first place, so please keep the suggestions and submissions coming in.  I hope you all enjoy what we have to offer this issue, from our regular columns, to a tour of Spur's various areas and locales, to the first few scenes of an original theatrical play.  Jump right in, and until next issue I remain…

Your not-so-humble EIC,
Marigold Lyrian

Exodus
By Anonymous

She woke slowly.  Sweet oblivion left as evaporating mist.  She clung to it, drawing it around her and cloaking herself in the darkness.  But tightly as she held it, it would no longer hold her.  She let it go and drifted.. Shrouding mist gave way to obscuring haze, she swam wearily to blurry consciousness.  Warm.. Her face was warm.  Dark eyes blinked open...  And snapped shut.  The sun was shining through her window again, and she had managed to stare right into it.  The slight woman groaned and turned away, colored spots danced before closed eyes.  No use, light everywhere.  A small flash of hope, the soft down pillow.  Blessed darkness, a tired smile... But no air.  The useless pillow sailed gracefully into the opposite wall.  Someone's personal effects tumbled to the floor, but the sharp clatter went unnoticed.  The only one who would care hadn't heard, and the only one who had heard was far from remorse.  She had to get up.
     
The ritual began, same now as always.  Delicate hands pulled travel-worn boots over small feet.  Nimble fingers went to work at laces, there and elsewhere, each twist and every swiftly-tied knot an ironic parody of how she really felt.  The tiny woman moved to her dresser as she shrugged into the last of her clothing and sat before the vanity mirror.  The whole thing was in sorry disrepair; scratches everywhere, knobs missing, and a rather large crack running across the upper right quarter of the mirror.  But it was hers, and it was all she could manage.  
     
Dark-skinned fingers wove their way through darker hair, patiently working lose even the smallest of tangles.  Short hair had been the way of things before. It was a matter of necessity.  But now was different.  It was growing, and would continue to do so if she took care of it.  A bit beyond shoulder length now, and she was still uncertain if she preferred it this way.  The look was nice, but it was also extra work.  For now, though, she wore it long because she could.  One hand worked loose the last snarl while the other reached for her hairbrush.. and closed on open air.
     
Black eyes blinked, fixed on her empty hand, widened, and narrowed to slits. An angry growl foreshadowed more articulate musings of a similar nature, most of which were unfit for even the least cultured of ladies.  She spoke them all the same, and with much authority.  A quick search through the dresser turned up nothing.  The letter, more clothing, her whetstone, but no hairbrush.
     
"Blasted Flerian!" She spat, she fumed, she stood.. she forgot all about being tired.  Her ire only worsened as she considered the likely outcome.  It wasn't enough to take it.  No.  He had to use it, too.  The last time this had happened, it looked like he'd been brushing those fuzzy fruits they sometimes sold at the market.  Cleaning the brush hadn't been a difficult task, but it was an irksome one.  And two of the wooden bristles had broken or fallen free when she'd made the attempt.  
     
The thick tarp was thrown aside.  Another of her luxuries, it separated her small area from the rest.  It gave her some measure of privacy.  Right now it was just in the way and little thought or care was spared for it as the small woman stomped towards her destination.  She wasted no time on the journey and arrived before news of her travel did.
     
"Where is he?" Hands on hips, deadly glare, demanding posture.  To say nothing of her tone.  He jumped like a scalded cat.  Yelled, too.  The noise did nothing to improve her mood.

"I- what?"

"Finch.  I want to know where he is." Relax.  Stay calm.  Breathe.  Ask questions, make sense..

"Why? What is this abo-"

"NOW." Arms crossed, jaw clenched, so much for calm.

"He went to visit his cousin's uncle's burrow.. I think.. or his uncle's cousin.." His brow furrowed in concentration. "No, wait.. It was his sister's.. No, that's not it.  Maybe it-" She growled. "I- he's not due back for another two days."

"I guess I'll just find it myself then."

"Find wha- hey! What are you doing?!"

"Finch took my hairbrush," She said it simply. "I want it back." The woman opened drawers and boxes, tossing things this way and that as she searched. He scrambled to minimize damages.

"That doesn't give you the right to- Hey! Careful with that, it's breakable!" She shrugged and tossed it in his direction. A panicked, fumbling catch and he set it down out of harm's way.  "Look, you can't just go through other people's stuff like this-" Some smooth stones, a medal from some merc's guild, a scrap of chainmail, she threw it all aside.
     
"He does." A tattered page from the local rag, the crosspiece for a string puppet...
     
"That's different, he's a flerian.  We don't have a lot of rules around here but we-" ...a ball of yarn, a half-finished woodcarving... "hey, I been looking for that!"
     
"Just help me find my hairbrush and I'll be out of your way."
     
"But you- I-" He gestured erratically, sighed, and gave up. "I haven't seen it.  I swear.  Not in a fortnight or so.  Are you really sure it was him?" That didn't even deserve an answer.
     
"Two days you said." She stood up next to the box she'd been kneeling over moments before.  "Then he comes back.  In two days, I want my hairbrush." She turned to leave. "I think it'll be a lot nicer for everyone if you ask him about it before I do." He called after her as she stepped out. 
     
"What's so special about THAT hairbrush anyway?" Her half-yell was directed vaguely over one shoulder as she made her way back down the hall.
     
"I'd like to ask Finch the same question."

....

Semi-hard soles slapped against rough wooden planks when she finally entered the common area.  There were more widows here and consequently more light.  The doorframe provided adequate support while she let her eyes adjust.  Around her things continued as normal.  The general hum of multiple conversations, with the occasional louder punchline.  The soft rasp of metal against leather or stone, the dull clink of gold and the higher-pitched chink of silver.  Scores of footsteps sounded off the same wooden planks she stood on, underscored by the distinct clack of wooden spoons against earthenware bowls.  An all too cheerful greeting to her left brought her attention to more immediate goings on.
     
"Hey!" A few blinks brought his face into focus. It was hard, angular, and almost as stark a contrast to the rest of those gathered here as his voice was.  He was seated at a wooden table just a few paces away. There was a clear spot on the bench in front of him.  She sat down.
     
"Morning, Lance." She blinked a few more times while details swam into clarity.  Enough detail to make out his look of disbelief.
     
"Morning?!" Confusion.. Disbelief.. And a little incredulity mixed in with the questioning upsweep at the end. "Sunset in half a glass! Where have you BEEN, woman?"
     
"Asleep." She scowled. "And do you HAVE to yell?" Lance opened his mouth to speak, denial the emotion easiest to read on the surface. "Oh, save it. I swear people could hear you clear across a field with that voice." She glanced sidelong at him, considering. "And that name of yours.. Was your father some kinda warlord or something?" Expressions changed, warred, melted into each other and changed again; all to fast for her to read. He settled on what looked to be annoyance as he sliced off some cheese from a block on his right. When he spoke the tone was more chagrined than anything.
     
"No," He placed the cheese on a slice of bread and lifted it in both hands. "my mother was." One eyebrow shot up of it's own accord, her eyes held the question unasked.  He took a bite of his meal and left it unanswered.  Lance chewed noisily with the sullen air of self-pity only humans seem to be capable of.  Gray eyes stared through her into nothing.  Without the chatter, her attention drifted to what he was eating.  Reminded by her hunger that she had not yet eaten, she broke a sizable portion from the loaf of bread in front of him.  Faced with the loss of his dinner, Lance pulled out of his mournful reverie.
     
"I was eating that!" The cheerful smile she turned on him by way of reply could have justified murder under the right circumstances.  
     
"And you're sharing it with me? Why thank you, Lance, that so terribly thoughtful of you."  He opened his mouth to protest again, then simply closed it with a resigned sigh.  The tone in her voice hadn't been lost on him.  Lance, like most the people she knew by name, knew how pointless it was to argue when she got sarcastic.  She in turn knew he wasn't going to stay upset for very long over a few morsels of food.  Though the scowl she got for taking some of his cheese said she'd better look elsewhere for pleasant conversation.  
     
Half-turning on the bench she scanned the room around her for someone else she knew.  Backs and shoulders everywhere.  For a moment the small woman felt nearly as annoyed as the human across the table.  Standing on the bench, however, was enough to afford a better view.  She caught a glimpse of tailored leather and silk to one side of the room that could only be one man.  Pasche, the man to know if you ever wanted to pull off a successful scam.  The most successful con artist in the guild to date. Decided, she hopped to the ground, took her meal, and picked her way through the crowd.
     
A scuff on the floor behind her, sounds of quick motion.  A quick sidestep carried her away from an impact that would have sent her sprawling. Two of the children rushed past, dodging and weaving through the crowd.  The dark-haired youth in the front carried a small coinpurse, likely filled with the traditional scraps of iron.  The sandy-haired one tailing was obviously playing the part of the guard until he could grab the purse, when the roles would change.  She briefly recalled how angry she'd been when Gib suggested she play that very same game with the children.  He'd said it would be good practice.  Now she was just angry that he'd been right.  Stepping quickly with a dancer's grace, she followed.  Adults moved without thinking to let the children by; trailing close behind gave her a fast way through the crowd that wouldn't be there if she waited.  She pulled up a chair and seated herself without preamble when she arrived.
     
"Hiya Pasche," She set her breakfast down on the table. "How's tricks?" Thin eyebrows strove towards each other with obvious confusion.  Sighing with the realization she'd made the same old mistake again, she tried to clarify.  "Anything new?" That earned her a handsome smile as he leaned forward to answer.
     
"Oh, the usual.  Working on a few projects, and I have some ideas that may turn a nice profit if I can flesh out all the details." He gave her a sidelong glance. "I also heard there's a new ship at port." Dark eyes grew slightly wider.
     
"Oh?" She tried to keep the surprise out of her voice, but her success was marginal.  Somehow Pasche always seemed to know what sort of business would appeal to her.  It was likely a good part of the reason why he had such success in his field, but it was still unnerving.  Pasche sat back with a satisfied smile.
     
"That's right.  I overheard one of my marks saying something about a few bottles of rare wine arriving with some ale for the local taverns.  Unless my memory fails me, the ship was due to arrive today."
     
"Hmmm.." She chewed thoughtfully at her lower lip.  Ships that stopped here generally stayed around for a few days.  And that meant shore leave.  If she could get to the crew before they drank their pay away... "Thanks Pasche." She was already headed for the door.
     
"Hey, wait! Aren't you going to finish your food?"

....

Having eaten her fill, she tossed the remaining crust of bread to one side of the alleyway.  The wharf lay only a few blocks to the south and she could already hear the raucous laughter of some of the sailors. Distinguishing words from such a distance proved impossible, but she could tell a few groups were headed in her general direction.  She continued easterly towards one of the smaller roads.  The main road was generally something she avoided; guards patrolled them and it took too much effort to leave them be. But it mattered little.  The back roads had the cheaper inns and taverns that most seafarers would be drawn to.  Especially after weeks at sea.  
     
Buildings around her cast long shadows as the sun set.  The shadows would be her cover.  She peered around the corner towards the bar then further down the street.  All clear.  All that was left was to find a good hiding spot without being seen.  Back pressed to the wall, hands flat at her sides, each step was silent as she crept around the corner.  The yell from behind that startled her was decidedly not.  She forced herself to react slowly as she looked towards the sound.  Leaning against the wall in such a posture was hardly the most natural look for the bar's patrons, but she strove to make it look normal.  
     
It had been a man calling to her.  Tall, roughened, and coming from the direction of the docks.  She wasn't expecting anyone to arrive till the sun was fully set. This one had apparently gotten an early start.  A second call and he jogged towards her, slowing at the other side of the street.  As he neared his gait became uncertain.  He was obviously moving in her direction, but he seldom looked where he was going.  Instead he cast nervous glances in all directions typical of anyone worried of being followed or seen.  The absurdity of yelling when you don't want to be seen made it difficult for her to keep from laughing at him.  She concealed her amusement in a slight smile.  In her mind she screamed at him.  Amateur.  But when she realized he'd spoken again, her next scream was at herself.  Pay attention!  The man saw her puzzled frown and realized she hadn't heard him. His gaze darted around once more then came to rest on her as he drew near. 
     
"How much?" He repeated.
     
Realization came to her in a rush.  She looked at him carefully, taking in every detail, and flashed him one of her best smiles.  Pleased, he grinned back.  The small woman stepped slowly towards him and wrapped her arms behind his neck.  Nimble fingers laced themselves together as she smiled wider, mischief clearly discernible in ebon eyes.  Heavy arms circled her, drawing the woman closer as she pressed one cheek against the man's chest.  She felt his breath warm against her neck as her knee made contact... Hard.
     
Muscles in his neck tensed while others went slack.  The strong arms around her became suddenly weak.  His mouth formed a silent O as his face contorted into a grimace of pain.  The woman moved back a step and looked at him.  Wide eyes stared back at her with impotent rage.  Very impotent.  She favored him with another smile; not nearly so pleasant as the last, but far more genuine.  Her fingers unlaced themselves and trailed to his shoulders.  A single gentle, nearly polite, shove and he tipped slowly backwards.  Small but surprisingly strong fingers closed around his coinpurse and tugged sharply on his way down.  
     
"I think this should be just about enough."  She resisted the urge to kick the downed man and turned her back on him.  She wanted to be away before he got his voice back, and certainly before he could stand.  She took off in the opposite direction she wanted to go and doubled back a few blocks northward.  She hadn't come up completely empty, but his shipmates would be more watchful now.  Tonight would be a wash.  Disappointed, she headed back for the guild.

....

The sun had scarcely dipped below the horizon when she arrived, and the reverberent slam of the door made certain that everyone noticed.  Especially the lone figure at the head table.  It was Gib, the guildmaster.  A crook of his finger brought her stomping in his direction; he waited patiently.  Only after she'd thrown the coinpurse on the table and herself into the chair across from him did he speak.
     
"Rough day?" He spoke in the guild tongue and glanced meaningfully at the frayed ends of the pursestrings.  She heard none of the thick accent she'd come to accept when he spoke in common.  A search of the go-blin-al's face revealed no hint of rebuke for the obviously bungled job.
     
"Day? I just finished breakfast! And now I'm stuck here all night." People would be watching for her, if not actively trying to find her.  She knew it, she accepted it.  But she didn't have to like it.
     
"You were seen." It was more a statement than a question.  She nodded confirmation.  He nodded as well, though more to himself than to her.  "We've been through this before.  Hiding well isn't enough.  You have to look like you belong where you are."
     
"I did." She scowled.  Gib ignored the interruption and went on.
     
"There are things you can do.  Try to look more like other people.  Change how you walk, cover those ears of yours, rub some dirt in your hair. There's all sorts of-"
     
"Put dirt in my hair?!" He sighed at the outburst and tried a different approach.
     
"Okay, nevermind the dirt.  But do you have to wear those clothes?" Black eyes narrowed.
     
"What's wrong with my clothes?" For the first time, the little man began to look unsettled.
     
"Nothing." He sighed again. "But do they always have to be leather?"
     
"I LIKE leather." Her tone would allow for no compromise. "And don't start in on me about the hemline again, either." Gib slammed his pudgy fists on the tabletop and swore.
     
"Woman this is a small town! You have to make a few changes, you're too noticeable!"
     
"Noticable?!" She laughed. "Noticeable Gib?  I'm the only one like me in the entire city! I stick out like a-"
     
"KONI!!" It came out a desperate whisper.  Gib glanced around the room quickly, meeting gazes which turned away.  Behind her to the left, she thought she heard someone snicker.  When he turned back to her he looked embarrassed... And a slightly deeper shade of green. "Look, I didn't want to say this, but maybe it's time." He stared down at the table a moment, composed himself, and continued. "Like I said, this is a small town. I haven't lied to you, there are things you could do, if you wanted. But like you said, you.." The wood grain of the table suddenly became very fascinating to him. "..stick out." He hurried on. "You're good," He looked up. "as good as many here and better than most. But I don't know if it's enough." He sighed, hesitated, and seemed to debate with himself for a moment. "Koni, I think you need to find a new town." The small Sanene woman sighed and sat back in her chair.
     
"Where, Gib? Where could I possibly go and how would I get there? Do you have any idea how long it's been since I saw anyone who looked like me?"
Gib leaned forward on one elbow.
     
"While you were off--wherever you were--some of our people were down at the docks.  Standard ruse, a couple folks distract them with questions, a few more make off with small bits of cargo, you know the deal." She did. "Usually the cargo is the only important part, but every now and then we get some useful information.  One of the sailors mentioned a place called Spur..."

....

Konichiwa packed her few belongings that night.  When the ship set sail a day later, she was on it.  Due to the inherent problems with booking passage on a ship where you might run into an old victim, she'd had to stow away.  But she was confident that her arrangements with the cabin boy would be enough to see her safely to her destination.

....

The ship had been at sea for several hours when she awoke.  It had taken considerable effort not to yell at the cabin boy for that, but his offer to bring her something to eat helped.  Her dreams of the night remained with her only as vague memories of the same nagging feeling she'd had ever since she'd gotten on the ship.  Still at a loss to say what she could have possibly forgotten, she shrugged it off and promised herself to think more on it with a full stomach.  Dark-skinned fingers wove their way through darker hair, patiently working lose even the smallest of tangles.  One hand worked loose the last snarl while the other reached for her pack to retrieve what she knew she would need next... And she remembered.

Saviour
By Guztymne RhorawytzR

The ring burned painfully as he tried to claw it out of his finger.  He scrapped at the metal, and even tore at his flesh, but the ring stuck on.  Tural cried out in pain.  He laid shriveling in the cold night, lit only by his copper lantern that sprawled out beside him.  Tural's finger burned crimson as he slipped into unconsciousness.

When he came about, Tural forgot about the ring for a second.  He woke up in Elindale's temple.  This surprised him, because he was not of this Religion, was he?  Besides, how had he come to this place?  Smokey incense filled the air, and beneath him, was a silken bed.  He glanced around, and felt a cold metallic ring around his finger.  He looked down at it.  The cursed ring!  The band was still wrapped around his right ring finger, as if smirking at his incapability to remove it.  He muttered a few words and his consequent pain subsided for the moment.  While he closed his eyes to rest again, a voice rang in his mind.  It was not a loud chaotic one, but a comfort, like a distant relative's greeting.  Tural concentrated on hearing the voice, perceiving its message.  It had something to do with the ring.  Tural heard voices around him, and heard a cleric's chanting.  Soon, he could feel the curse around his ring being lifted and his eyes flung open.  He rushed to pull the ring out, and to his surprise, it came off easily.  It flew to a corner of the room because he had applied so much force.  He sprang to his feet, and bowed to the monk standing in front of him.  The monk glanced at his feet, and moved away.  Tural went to pick the ring up, which he quickly put into his knapsack.  He proceeded to take a few fruits from a table and made his way from the temple.

On the way, he refreshed himself with some native fruits that he got from the temple, and was pleasantly pondering at the invigorating nature of the fruits.  He got a map from his inventory and glanced at it, finding his direction and making his way to the local apothecary.

Between the musky smell of scrolls and fungus, Tural sensed his answers were to be find in scholarly thoughts.  He proceeded to a spectacled man at the desk, and as he opened his mouth to speak, the man looked up at him and stopped him by putting his hand over Tural's mouth.

Tural could feel the man's good aura, so he acquiesced to the man's demand.  The man led Tural down a flight of stairs to a basement filled with even more shelves of scrolls.  The man looked up at him through his murky glasses and spoke, "This is safer."

Though puzzled, Tural remained calm, reminding himself that his sword was just one second away.  The man grinned at Tural, and reassured him, saying that he had received word from a clairvoyant that a man of great destiny was to visit him this day.  He reached behind a shelf and pulled out a moldy scroll and handed it to Tural.  Upon touching his fingers, the scroll crumbled into dust, and Tural's mind opened to the thoughts of the Psycian race.  There were cries, pleas and awkwardly, laughter.

"Yes, I am a half-Psycian, from my mother's side.  There is great... how should I put it in common terms... turmoil.  You have been chosen,"  the man touched Tural's knapsack.  He continued, "Don't resist the ring.  Accept it.  It is not evil.  You found it for a reason, and it was the work of only the great Psycian mage Edoria who allowed you to find it."

"It is not even the matter of the Psycian race.  It is a matter of the entire identity of magick.  The Psycians, being mentally more sensitive than other races, are being affected first, even more so than the Frontacians or the Arachnians.  You can see the plague that is going around in Spur.  No one talks about it, it's a taboo.  But you can be assured that it will spread, beyond all races and identities, and this changed identity of magick will..."

The man choked, wiping his spit that ran from the corners of his mouth onto his beard, and drippled down onto the floor.  Tural looked with disgust in his heart, but only emotion in his eyes as he removed his bandanna and helped the old man wipe his saliva from his face.  

"You have been chosen," the man said, and made his way up the stairs.  Tural followed him, asking him questions, but the man said nothing in return.  Tural continued to question the man about his destiny, but the man made no reply.  In the building, a lady walked in, and looked at Tural awkwardly as Tural spoke to the man.  She then questioned his actions, and he replied that the man had owed him some sort of explanation about what he said.

"But my brother is mute.  Please do not make fun of him.  I hope you leave this place immediately,"  she replied, suddenly quite stern.  Tural blinked at her, glanced again at the apothecary, and left.

Sitting on a rock, he wondered what had happened.  He reached into his inventory and pulled out the ring that he had found.  He could still feel the sting on his fingers as he glared at the band of metal.  Don't resist the ring, the old man had said.  He closed his eyes as he slipped the metal onto his right ring finger.  There was no pain.  He soon attuned himself to the Psycian pain-cries.  The Psycians seemed to know of his mission, probably through the old man from the apothecary.  Perhaps, he was their savior?  Tural, despite all the time, could never get accustomed to the laughter ringing in his ears.  Who was laughing in the midst of all the chaos?  It wasn't a Psycian, he knew.  With the ring as a new guide, Tural followed the ring's silent instructions and made his way east.

The laughter must be the source of the pain, Tural reasoned.  From the traveling, he had all the spare time to work things out in his mind.  His intellect was unique to a fighter like himself, though it saved his skin many times.  Now, more than ever, without a group of traveling warriors of mages, he was alone, and his instinctive wisdom would come in handier than ever.  The ring did not fail to find him a sanctuary from the hot sun when he rested, or a spring when he thirst.  Also, there were game, huntable animals, even when he traveled across barren deserts.  It was funny that through all his life, not even an Anthian Forester could match the guide of this ring.  Still, he traveled gruelingly through the hazardous terrain, making his way east.

Eventually, the ring stopped in its silent guidance.  This must be the place, Tural thought.  Tural could feel an impulse to dig, and he went right ahead to do it.  That might be the voice of the ring.  Not before long, he found a trapdoor in the sand and opened it.  It led downwards, and he went into the darkness, his faith resting in the ring around his finger only.

Tural's left hand wrapped itself around the hilt of a sword that was sheathed across his right leg.  The ring pulsed slowly in his mind, his legs moving instinctively as if he had been here before.  He could hear chatter behind a heavy iron door, and the ring told him to go that way.  Tural's heart beat like a butterfly trapped in a bottle, and his throat was tied up like knots on a ship.  Tural pushed open the door, and saw a council of mages standing before him.  A man at the head of the oblongish table laughed.

That laughter!  He had heard it before- in the Psycian links.  He glared at the man, and then the man spoke.

"Aaa, Edoria, how nice of you to join us,"  he bellowed.

Edoria?  Tural thought.  But how..

"Your mind must be plagued by the memory block we conjured up.  The plague was a success.  Here, let me remove the block for you,"  the man laughed, and with his claws, he gestured in the air and a purple fog covered Tural.  Tural's mind opened like a flower, and he understood his identity.

"My dear Darklord, the plan has worked," Edoria spoke as the Darklord handed him his reward of a sceptre that promised 'power beyond imagination'.  "The plague has continued as planned, and the people think that this 'Tural' is going to bring them hope.  How ingenious."

Ever and Always
By Berial Ambrosius

The land you say that you love
The land that you have dreamed of
Beyond the far horizon
Are skies that you can fly in

You go there, you'll go forever
I go there, I'll lose my way
If we stay here, we'll be together
Ever and always.

Beneath the twinkling star light
I watch you fade from eyesight
My soul is slowly bleeding
From burning want and needing

You go there, you'll go forever
I go there, I'll lose my way
If we stay here, we'll be together
Ever and always.

Bronze 3
By Rhea Romero

Lobb dropped easily into the trapdoor in the ground.  Inzy followed - well, most of Inzy followed.

"Hello," she said.  "I'm standing in the tunnel and my shoulders are feeling the breeze."

"Hey, lady, it's not our fault you're freakishly tall," said the Flerian.

"Freakishly tall?  I'm five-nine!  How'm I supposed to get through there?"  Inzy shuffled her feet testily.

"Crawl," Lobb offered.

Inzy laughed derisively.  "Okay, sure, but after that why don't you buy me a new Rehas gown?  How much is this 'mission' gonna pay you, Lobb?"

"Take it off," said the Flerian.

There was a pause.  "Perverts," she said.  "I'll crab walk."

The trapdoor was shut.  The three linked hands and moved down the dark tunnel, Inzy muttering to herself much of the way.  Eventually a dull light began to shine, the noise of many voices crept towards them, and they entered a very large and dusty chamber.

The cavern was well lit and packed wall to wall with short people of every stripe.  Flerians, Hithuals, and Go-blins abounded.  Inzy received many stares.  Their guide led them over to a tasteful little table and they all sat down.

The Flerian was short, even for his race, and had bright blue hair twisted into a corkscrew shape over each ear.  "My name," he said quickly, "is Corky.  I assume you are the one?"  Lobb nodded and flashed his medallion.  Corky smiled and relaxed a little. "Super.  The girl - they mentioned her."

"They did?" Inzy sounded very surprised.

Corky frowned.  "Of course.  Whaddaya think?  Anyway, They never said she'd be an Elf.  This complicates things, you know.  How are you supposed to transport her?"

"She'll do all right," said Lobb with the self-assured air of a man who has no idea what he's getting himself into.  Corky shrugged,

"You're the boss.  I'm just here to give you directions."  He promptly pulled a map out of nowhere.  "Look.  This here passage to the south" - he pointed across the chamber - "oughta lead you right to the main line.  From there follow the blue marks to Checkpoint Two, where you can take the tram down to Brak.  I'll warn you, however, that it won't STOP at Brak, so you'll have to jump.  You'll meet up with a Secian girl there with a bronze chain around her neck.  Okay?  She'll send you off on your next leg.  Got it?"

Lobb looked exactly like he hadn't.

"Got it!" said Inzy cheerfully.  Lobb was obliged to nod.  Corky grinned conspiratorially and ran away with the map.

"You really memorized the directions, Usil," Lobb said.  

"Well, yeah," she said.  "It wasn't that much.  You just supply the brawn, I'll handle the brains, okay?"  She got up but Lobb grabbed her arm.

"If we work together, Usil, we'll have to get along," he said shortly.  "Right?"

"Right," snapped Inzy.  She snatched her arm away and stalked off.  "But you don't have to get nasty about it!"

Journal of Spurian Fauna, Entry #1: The Vermin
   
(this letter was found in the possession of a thief posing as a 'messenger'.  Taken and translated, we then sent the letter on as addressed, but decided that the translation might make interesting reading.  We, however, prefer to remain anonymous.)


To the illustrious Sagemaster, Sages' Guild, Saldaea:

It has now been three weeks since my appointment to the post of Zoological Researcher First Class, Spurian.  Having begun my journey at once with the funds allocated me, I have finally--after a harrowing boat right which I was lucky to escape with my life--reached the 'city' of Spur.  If you wish to call it that.  Truly, this is more of a frontier outpost--a poorly-constructed, filthy slum in the middle of an unending grassland.  Vermin are everywhere; however, this researcher is dedicated to the study of Spurian fauna, and not its population.

After arrival at the city's docks, I hauled myself and my baggage up a treacherous road (this horrible city is full of rogues and bandits) and through the gates into the city.  I was encouraged at first by the winding road that passed through the city's noble district; tall mansions (even that of the elusive governor) towered over me, and I was surrounded by lovely trees.  Until I entered the actual city, I thought perhaps the chaos outside the gates was a fluke, and I had stumbled upon a place of beauty and civilization in the wilderness.  Until I saw two tall Leuians--yes, those proud khats--slaughtering a guardsman, I imagined that this duty would not be as unpleasant as my dreams foretold.  Alas…how wrong I was!

I found a room in the first inn I stumbled across, the Gilded Lion.  An inspiring name, and the rooms were (at least) clean; although I fear strange noises from the kitchen will disturb me through this entire visit.  Unpacked, bathed, and finally in clean clothes (the boat was *truly* horrid), I set off scroll in hand to find a reliable guide--someone to show me the variety of animals that live within the city and around its walls.

The innkeeper, when I asked where I could find a reliable guide to the animals living within Spur, smiled (a bit strangely, but then everyone here is odd) and directed me to the Town Square and a diminutive person whose name I have not yet learned.  Despite being small and slightly green--and smelling a bit of sewer--he seemed to know his business when I asked, and his fee was not *too* much.  (Although I do hope the next boat from home will bring my salary with it.)  My money disappeared into the guide's coinpurse (kept sensibly close to his person), and we set off.  I was surprised to find him leading me back to my own Inn, and even more surprised when, watching him lift a dusty rug in a back room with some trepidation, he uncovered a trapdoor!  That horrible sewer smell filled the room when he lifted the door, and the thought of traipsing around in that unsanitary underworld made me shudder; but we must sacrifice for science, and besides I had already paid the creature's fee, so I resolved myself to the situation and, trying not to breathe too often, climbed down into the stinking gloom with my guide's lantern showing the way.

Unsurprisingly, Spur's sewers are infested with vermin.  Several times I was forced to defend myself against the squeaking, shadowy shapes that passed us in the dark.  And then there were the rodents, the subject of this first study.  You cannot possibly imagine how distasteful it was to be in their presence day after day, observing what they eat and where they live.  But as this subject has given me all the information I can find, my report is as follows.

RATS and RODENTS: the two lesser species of vermin.  The rats are small, none more than a foot and a half in length, and are basically the same as rats in Saldaea.  The rodents are some sort of other vermin, rat-like, but not exactly the same.  They are smaller in size and not as aggressive.  Both species feed off the leavings of other, larger predators, or whatever edible sewage they can find, or--most horribly--each other, when there is nothing else.

LARGE RODENTS:  A truly larger form than the normal rodent, these can grow up to 3' in length.  Their teeth are almost two inches long, and their bite (so my guide says) can cause horrible pain and infection.  They feed on lesser rats and rodents, as well as any small animals that wander into the sewage tunnels.

KILLER RATS:  Even bigger than large rodents, these bad-tempered vermin are called so because they can kill weak members of most species unless one has special protection or runs fast enough.  That should make it clear what they feed on.  They can grow to almost 5' long, not including the tail.

MAN RATS:  Some sort of horrible magic accident must have created these aberrations; they are bipedal, and rumor has it that some may use weapons.  Their bite is truly nasty, and I will admit that, after an attack by two of the creatures, my dubious guide saved my life.

WERE-RATS:  I did not actually find one of these monsters during my search, but my guide was happy to tell me of them.  He claimed that the were-rats were born as sentient people who were, at some time in their lives, bitten by a diseased rat.  This infection supposedly warps their bodies, turning them into some rat-creature similar to a man-rat, but more powerful--and more dangerous.

Other creatures reside in the sewers, of course, but I have decided to limit my studies to one species at a time.  If my messenger is found to be trustworthy, I will send another report to you next month.  My regards to you, Sagemaster, and please see to it that my salary is sent promptly; the thieves in this city are uncontrollable.

Your Servant,
Jysin Zamor, Firian researcher

RESET
by Reason Valencia

Something was boiling in the clear crystal vial.  Sunlight glowed through the container, shining clear from the window's side and green when it came out the other, because the boiling liquid was a translucent jade color.  Silver calipers held the vial a few inches above a glowing crystalline stone.

The vial wavered for a second.  This is because the apprentice who held those silver calipers--who had just yawned sleepily and blinked his bloodshot eyes--a second later was slapped lightly across the back of his head.  The slapping hand was pale, wrinkled with age, and belonged to the sleepy apprentice's master.
"Do not yawn," the master ordered in a creaky whine.  "And do not flinch when punished, either.  This substance is not stable, and unless you take every possible precaution…and hold it absolutely still as it reduces...it will boil over, as you can see it is about to do, and possibly drip onto the heatstone below, and produce a reaction which being far beyond your poor adolescent mind's comprehension I will attempt to explain--"

By the time the nearest Arcanians arrived, seeking the source of whatever explosion had rumbled through the air seconds earlier, the unlucky apprentice (whose name was Kyths) had already made his singed, goo-covered escape.

THAT AFTERNOON...

"...and then the concentrate blew up," Kyths finished glumly.  Three showers later and his hair was still sticky.  "All over the lab.  He'll kill me."
"Oh, he will not."  The girl who sat next to Kyths on his stone bench was half a handspan taller than he and had wispy pale hair that matched the moonlight carnelian in her forehead.  "Nobody else puts up with his whining. He might turn you into a cabbit or something for a few days."
"Yes, and then his familiar will eat me.  Sa's left hand, Tsille, I'm sick of apprenticing.  When do we get to the real channeling?"

Tsille rubbed her fire rune self consciously.  It had been implanted just three days before, still ached a little, and although she couldn't use it yet, the implied change in her rank and status set her apart from the other apprentices.  Apparently Kyths was still her friend, though, and she decided to let him in on her secret.
"Kyths, listen," she whispered, "I heard something yesterday.  But you have to swear to Sa that you'll never ever tell."

Kyths perked up instantly.  Tsille was apprenticed to one of the most powerful Sages in Arcania, and she got (through her particular brand of 'overhearing') all the best gossip.  "I swear to Sa," he whispered back, polishing briefly the sky-blue sapphire between his brows with his left index finger.  "Now tell."

Tsille never hesitated.  "Some of the highrank are going up Silvepeak to steal dragon eggs!  I overheard Syssha talking to her partner about it."  Her voice was so hushed Kyths had to strain to understand it, but once he did, an excited grin crossed his face.  "Incredible," he breathed, and a little spark entered his eyes.

Tsille began to wonder if she should have told him.

...

The sun is setting over Arcania.  Its warm gold light washes over an oasis of beauty hidden in the rocks and crags of the Silve range, a deep valley overshadowed by the mountain to the east, surrounded by cliffs to the north and south.  Snowmelt from Silvepeak formed the Runefire River that flowed through Arcania's heart and away through the high pass to the east.  The land sparkled with life now it was inhabited--before the Arcanians discovered it, little more was there than a tiny river with a few fig trees and scrub vegetation growing on the banks.  

Of course, that was before the intense magic deposit that existed beneath the valley's floor was discovered.  Now Arcania was a paradise; homes carved magically from the living cliffs, with food grown and animals grazed in the almost supernaturally fertile soil near the river.  Fortified by nature, it made the perfect refuge for a peaceloving people.

...

"And this new project, Seron, what did you call it?" The Sages' Guild representative asked.  He peered through thin, purified rock-crystal lenses at the shining forest of laboratory equipment and liquid-filled flasks.  "Reset?"
 
Seron nodded absentmindedly.  Wiry even for Arcanian standards, balding a little, and brilliant, he did lose himself easily in the glamour of his projects.  The Sages encouraged his experiments, but were wary of his eccentricity enough to keep a close eye on him.  "Oh..RESET is just an acronym.  Retro-Entropic SynapsE Training is the name."  His attention caught by a rippling pattern on a nearby chart, Seron hrrrmphed and began fiddling with a nearby silver pendulum.  

Sage Skavyr cleared his throat good-naturedly.  "And, ah..what exactly will it do when it is finished?" He inquired.

"It makes the mind more flexible," the researcher mumbled, and then caught Skavyr's worried expression.  "For learning and memory.  You see, from the new sage Friyd's research, we know that the cause of memory loss through aging is a sort of stiffening of the mind.  The elixier I attempt to create now should either slow or even halt this process, making memory retention and even the learning of new information much more stable."

Sage Skayvr, who privately thought Friyd was a petulant young twit entirely too obsessed with his parents, nodded.  At least it was no new spell to make wine rain from the sky, or to move Silvepeak a foot east so the sunset would not be obstructed, or any other foolishness.  "Very well," he mumbled, taking out a scroll of vellum and a stylus.  "How much do you expect this all to cost..."

...

Kyths scurried up the gravel path with Tsille not far behind, looking worried.  They each carried a small pack, complete with note scrolls, ink and stylus.  Up ahead they could barely see the Arcanin runemages dissapearing into the Dragonhome cavern.

"Kyths!" Tsille hissed. "We should go back!  We'll get in trouble!"

The apprentice showed no sign of answering, and she cursed..but followed.  It didn't take them long to reach the misty entrance to Dragonhome, a massive tunnel system running--rumor had it--throughought the heard of Silvepeak and even some of the surrounding cliffs.

...

"This is it!" Seron crowed.  His apprentice, a quiet lanky girl with a dark amber gem, held a smoking crucible steady, her hands safe in heatproof mitts.  "One last ingredient and we'll proceed to the test stage."

...

Tsille stared as Kyths began to creep into the cavern.  She hissed at him a few times to return, to not be an idiot, that he would get them both killed, but in a moment he was lost from sight.  Her courage failing her, she turned to run...as a low rumble sounded off in the distance.  Kyths appeared in the cavern's entrance again, staring at something to the east.  "What in Sa's name is THAT?" he demanded.

A silver line was approaching, filling the horizon end to end.  It looked almost like the light of dawn as it swept across the valley, but as the silver light raced closer the youths could see great clouds of dust and steam rising behind it.

"Inside!"  Tsille shrieked, and ran for the cavern, pulling Kyths along behind her.  Before they'd come more than four manlengths into the entrance, they heard a metallic screech before them, and shouts, and running footsteps.

...

"Here we are.." the pale researcher muttered.  His apprentice looked nervous, but Seron was too deep in concentration to hear the low rumbling from the east.  With sure hands he poured a drop of glistening clear liquid into the steaming crucible, watching the container glow pale blue with magic as the chemicals mixed.

...

Tsille ran headfirst into Syssha, her mistress, and Kyths was unable to stop himself.  They and the Arcanin runemages tripped and toppled and landed in a heap.  Tsille lay on her back, stunned, with a large warm mottled something in her arms; she stared at it in shock.

"An egg?" She gasped, and the object in her arms twitched.

...

Seron finally took notice of the sound when, his apprentice fled and his entire lab shaking, a glass vial fell from the wall and shattered on the floor.  He saw the silver light outside his window and had no time to pray to Sa for salvation.

...

Unmagic swept across Arcania, its chaos wave warping or destroying everything in its path.  It raced towards Silvepeak, sealing the destiny of all in the Dragonhome caverns; in passing it twisted the minds and bodies of those Arcanians who had been engrossed in their study of the giant spiders who lived in the cliff caves, feeding off rodents and the occaisional baby dragon; it pulsed over Seron's laboratory.  The precious vial, his life's work, was blasted from its creator's hand; its contents spilled and mingled with the unmagic; its purpose twisted and corrupted even as it was absorbed.  The unmagic wave glowed blue for a moment, and then anyone who may have witnessed it was forever changed.  

The Unmagic would change all lives, forever.

...

YEARS LATER...

Jesa picked herself up from the cobblestones and leaned heavily on the side of the gleaming arch.  Around town square many others were doing the same, groaning or cursing, and dusting themselves off.  Some still lay unconscious.  

Jesa's brother Seb stumbled over to her and rested his head on her shoulder, trying to catch his breath.  "I..hate those.." he moaned.  Hearing his boots crunch in something, Jesa looked down to see her feet surrounded by shards of broken glass.

"Oh, no.." she wailed.  "My new lantern!  It's gone!"

Seb sighed and nodded.  "Welcome to Spur.." he bemoaned.  "That happens every once in a while.  Nobody knows why.  But it can make you drop your things, or forget skills if you learned them not too long ago.  Some kind of disease, maybe."

Jesa frowned, and kicked the shattered remains of her lantern petulantly. "How annoying," she grumbled, and her brother patted her head sympathetically.  "Stupid resets.." he sighed.

Spur on two Silver
By Frason Dranco

Spur, named appropriately for it's central focus on trade and commerce, is one of the world's finest place to find goods, diverse cultures, adventurers, religions, and weirdoes named Arioch.

Out of all this high standing culture, the commoner can easily find wonders on his own limited coin purse. From great deals in the bazaar, strange adventurers revolving around the trade and export of magical drugs, and old blind men who will tell you one of the meanings of life (not to be confused with blind old men that beg for money in the street that trip people with their canes, those are to be avoided). The following is a guide to Spur's general areas, and the cheapest entertainment that can be found.


Due to budget constraints (and a lazy author) Spur of Two Silver will be divided up into 3 parts. The first (this one) dealing with the areas that you, Joe/Jane Commoner, will see the most gawking like a sun stroked yelican. After that will be the two more 'limited appeal' areas of our fair city, and the final one with a look into the darker areas of said city.

Town Square (central Spur):

For those who want a piece of the Adventuring life without paying for it, this is the place to hang out. Various warriors, healers, mages, and other types of people are forever gawking at the hero statues that seem to litter the place. A main attraction is the mystical portal in it's exact center. 20 feet tall, and made of what appears to be one very large block of gold, chiseled out painstakingly to resemble two grappling Dragons. 

When you tire of the sites, various shoppes around this area will give you beyond your moneys worth. From the almost palpable aura of compressed thoughts and budding insanity originating from the Psycian Center, to great visual demonstrations given by The House of the Dead concerning their resurrections methods (they do not recommend a tour after a large meal, however). Most businesses in this area give tours and information of their buildings for free, as a promotional to all of Spur, and their wares in general.

If you want to be so limited as to staying in this one area, there is also a magnificent 3-star hotel in the general area who hasn't charged to sleep in their lobby for years, and a Casino (as of this writing finishing a currently 2 year project to redo the spike tables) to the south of it. A bank is also on hand to take care of your monetary needs (can't imagine why, since you only have two silver).

General area rating: 4 stars.

The Merchant's district (western Spur):

Window shopping at it's finest come from this area of the city. Anything you can imagine you can buy in this huge arena of sales. Sadly, since you only have 2 silver, you'll be window shopping.

This area has been divided into two separate regions by a East to West road running right through the district. This has made the getting and going along this area very easy, but access to clusters of shops more confusing. While you can find an assortment of baubles lining the street, the main window shopping pleasure will come from those clusters.

The most compact of the clusters is known as the Merchant's Circle. Branching off the main road and to the south, that also lays access to an old torch shop, and through an lovely arch. This area is aptly named, as the arch opens up into the center of a large Circle, with a local bank teller close on hand for those banking needs. All around you, in every direction, is shops that deal in everything from general selling, gemstones, used armour, weapons, and a few of the more excellent taverns and inns.

To the north is the sprawling Bazaar. A literal maze of booths, shops, wheelings, dealings, and the occasional mugger. A shopper could find anything they need in this area, save one problem; it's a maze! Shops and booths and everything else of all strips have set shop in what seems to be a blatant attempt to confuse a novice wanderer. It is recommended you be accompanied by a trusted companion and shown the ropes of the area's set up before you adventurer into it by yourself.

General area rating: 3 stars.
Merchant's Circle: 4 stars.
Bazaar: 2 stars.

Our Life
by Solic Xacar

 Warning: this play is not based upon true events. The people involved are fictional and the plot is thought up by the author himself. 

The setting for this play is in a town. Just any town. There is the town square, the merchants, the nobles, the guilds. There is a place for those to get healed, to worship, to practice skills, to work. But there is something in this town that is different than all the rest. The lives of these people may seem ordinary.. Or are they? The thoughts and actions of each of the characters maybe as plain as a glowhead's 66 point psi bolt, or might be as complex as weaving runes. Imagine the stage, just a black backdrop with shadows covering it. And a single torch in the center in the room, surrounded by chairs, with 2 tables to either side. That is our life.

LIST OF CHARACTERS:

In order of appearance:

Sarganis- male Hithual bard.
Narcein- male Hithual sword cleric
Ariynia-female Hithual fighter
Morlaki-  male Usil elf Merchant
Cebar- male Leuian hand cleric
Boy 1
Foryan- male Frontacian rune mage
Nareu- male Hithual barbarian
Ventra- female Flerian thief
Leuian 1
Leuian 2
Leuian 3
Mother- Hithual heart cleric				

Act I

Sarganis:
(Sarganis is standing on the stage, holding a silver cane and a lit torch.)
Good evening, my brothers and sisters
To see the story of two young lovers
Trapped in a dream world of imagination
Where they yearn and long for a chance of redemption
But be aware, travelers, for things are not what they seem
For our life is not what it seems
(Sarganis puts the torch in the center of the room, and extinguishes it.)

Narcein: 
(Narcein enters right and sits on a chair in the center of the room. He pulls out a match, lighting the torch, and pulls out a cigarette, smoking it softly) Hello, weary travelers! Welcome to my humble dwelling. I see that your tired and restless, that night must have been rough. You can stay at my house for a few days, to rest those eyes. (Narcein glances out at you, and a curious look comes to his face) You're new here, eh? Welcome to the Town. I don't know a name for it, yet. It's a nice town. Multi-racial, unlike my homeland. To the west are the merchants. (points offstage right) And the east, the Guilds. (points offstage left) That's pretty much our town. You'll like it hear, I'm sure. We always enjoy visitors. (Ariynia enters, stage left, holding a red rose, dancing and looking at the stars, merrily. Narcein looks at her, and offers his hand to her, and they join hands.)

Ariynia:
 Narcein, it's lovely! It matches my eyes! (Narcein grins at her, pleased.) I see that you've taken up the new ones, right? (Narcein nods at her, smiling ) 

Narcein:
I was hoping to get then introduced to this land, to live with us.. Oh, almost forgot. This is Ariynia, my friends. My beloved fiancee. (Ariynia looks out to the audience and blushes, and kisses Narcein)

Ariynia: 
And awful proud of it! (she giggles) Narcein is the oldest one in our town. He's been around a good 90 some odd years, I think. (Narcein pokes her lightly in the stomach)

Narcein: 
Aw, now I can't play "guess how old I am?" (he gets a wicked grin in his eyes, and pulls Ariynia close to him) We've been engaged for quite a while now, just trying to get the money for a proper wedding. (a glimmer appears in Ariynia's eyes)

Ariynia: 
Narcein is quite the mover. He may not make to much money, but his good looks and great charm make up for that. All we want to do is move into a new house on top of that hill and have kids, after we're married, of course! (Ariynia giggles) He's a great man, I'm sure he'll take good care of you. (turns to Narcein) Morlaki's here, right now.. Do you have any money with you? We need to buy some goods!

Narcein: 
Aye, I suggest we start looking at rings. My friends, wish to join us? Morlaki's the local merchant, has some awfully nice stuff in his store. Come on, we'll treat ya to something (Narcein winks, and joins hands with Ariynia, as they exit stage left)

ACT II

(People surround two tables, looking down at the wares. A tall Usil Elf stands between two tables, displaying his fine goods. Narcein and Ariynia get lost in the jewelry section, as they inspect the fine rings of gold and diamond nature.)

Narcein:
(grabbing a ruby encrusted gold band) You like it, my love?

Ariynia: 
That I do, but it needs another gem on it, somewhere... (She grabs a silver band with a huge diamond in the center, holding it up as it glimmers in the light) I was thinking of something more like this. (Narcein gapes and looks at his coin purse, trying to count the many bank notes inside.  He gives her this empty look, and she puts the ring down) Maybe we can buy it next time, no?

Morlaki: 
Narcein, Ariynia, how are you two? I've heard about the marriage, and I've decided to give you a discount on the rings.. Not a great discount, but just enough so you can get the ring you want. (the happy couple look at each other, gleefully)

Narcein: 
Your too kind, my friend.. Umm, you got anything that is reasonable? Like, under a good 75k? (Morlaki just gapes at him, astonished) Umm... Well, I guess a bit under 125k? (Morlaki smiles, happy that he finally has someone willing to buy something) 

Morlaki:
For that price, I can get you either Ruby, Emerald, or Sapphire.  Unless you want to spend more money, you can't get a diamond ring. 

Narcein:
 We're still considering diamond, though.. Maybe we'll have enough for it, next week. (Morlaki smiles, flashing his teeth)

Morlaki:
Very well then, my friends.. Do you care to look at anything else today? (the couple shrugs) 

Ariynia:
We're happy for all the help, my friend.. We just need to see our price range, and we'll be fine. (Cebar enters from behind the stage, walking on, and slams his coin-purse on the table)

Cebar:
I made a good 40 k from ze lil' critters that teem ta hide in the forest, Mor.. Ya got anythin' fer me? (Cebar belches, and swaggers) Any ale?

Narcein:

Cebar: I'm awright, thank ye's. Now, mer ale? pwease? (Morlaki just stares at him and hides all his ale from the drunken Leuian) Darnit.

Ariynia:
 (laughing) How the heck could you kill anything while your drunk? Narcein can.. but get the endurance only a Hithual can! I would know! (she winks)

Narcein:

Cebar:
As long as they got beer or ale, they're good enough for me! (he exits, stage left a boy emerges from the shadows in the right of the market area, of flerian decent)

Boy 1:

Narcein:
We better get going, the sun is going down. Ariynia, you with me (they join hands) And my friends, come to my house to stay. The night can get rough, and you don't want to be outside.

The Tale of Clan Bloodbaine
by Anvil Bloodbaine

For those of you who do not know me, I am Anvil Bloodbaine, Hithual Sword Cleric of Sa, and proud member of the Colinth Argonix.  I arrived in Spur a short 6 months ago Spurian time.  However, my family has been in Spur for much longer.  The first members of Clan Bloodbaine came to Spur to refine their skills as hunters and defenders of the Hithual Nation.  My brother, Kayan, was present in Spur long before me.  Having gained renown as a fighter in the CA, he returned to our territory in the Dark Forest.  I have often heard him speak of many of Spur's great fighters, long before they were the champions they now are.  He spoke of the Noble Jazbo, and of Mestoffa, and a host of others who at that time were just beginning their adventures in Spur.  He also spoke of those who are no longer with us, of the notorious gladiator RCV, the noble yet fearful Sensuous, and the always troublesome Wesley Buckhanna.  What lies below is our history, the history  of my clansmen and clanswomen.  It is a story of great love, great hatred, and great sacrifices.  I hope you find it intriguing.

Clan Bloodbaine was not always known as such.  Long before my grandfathers, the clan went by the surname of Rockhard.  Even today, many of our far reaching descendants still carry on that proud name, some of whom call Spur home.  The times before the sanctions against my family were proud times.  The mines bore prodigious amounts of precious gems.  Raids by rogue dragons were but distant memories, and the wars with the Goblin-al had faded into the past as well.  Indeed, it was a fine time for all Hithual.  Many of my clan found themselves with time to spare, having little to do save the mining which Hithuals so dearly love, a love of labor.  So it was that my grandfather, Borun Rockhard, felt the uneasiness known as wanderlust grow within him.  Taking but a few mining implements and some weapons, he and a few other close family members set out for the far reaches of the Great Divide, to the Dark Forest, bordering upon the lands of the Goblin-al, and unknown for the most part by Hithual at that time.  At most there were a few scarce outposts there, long forgotten towers where signal fires no longer burned to warn of incoming invasions or marauding hordes.
	
It was in the Dark Forest that Borun and his brother Durik oversaw the operation of the amber mines which were at that time so precious to the Hithual economy.  Their work there was difficult, as the forest held many dark and mysterious secrets, many of which frightened the members of a Hithual clan who knew little of magic.  Indeed, it was thought that somewhere within the depths of the forests a group of Elven mages resided, hidden from the outside world , and known only by their infrequent encounters with lost travelers.  For a race whose essence is thought to be magical in origin, Hithual can at times be extremely distrustful of all dealings with such.
	
It was upon one lonely moonlit night that Borun Rockhard, searching the surrounding countryside for possible mining sights, came upon an female Elven mage, locked furiously in battle with a band of marauding fire trolls.  Despite the numbers which assailed her, the Usil had managed to kill a great many of the creatures…..singed bodies attesting to her deadly accuracy with fire and lightning spells.  However, it was clear to Borun that the elf was weakening, at that soon the sheer numbers of the opponent would overwhelm her.  

Weighing the decision heavily, and knowing that Hithual and Elf were by no means a common alliance at that time, Borun rushed into battle at the side of the weakening Usil mage.  Wielding his ancestral War-Mattock, Borun cleaved the head of the first troll completely in two, the gelatinous contents spewing and sputtering as the victim fell dead to the ground below.  The Usil, understanding the need for quick action, continued her defense with renewed earnest, as the woods became ablaze with the flickering of bolts of lightning and spheres of fire.  In the end, it was only by a storm of fire that the two were able to escape with their lives, both weakened dramatically by the whole ordeal, but with the Usil on the brink of death.
	
Borun carried the body of the dying Elf to a nearby glen, where he hoped to ease her last moments in this world.  Looking closely at an elf for the first time, he marveled at her incredible beauty.  Her silver tresses flowed gently down around shoulders strong  yet delicate, her body lithe, firm, and athletic.  But most of all, Borun was transfixed by the beautiful visage which stared up at him:  Eyes which mirrored the stars above,   like the multi-faceted gems he sought in his precious mines.  It was then and there that Borun felt some unexplained presence come into his being.  Without thinking, he laid his hands upon the runestone of Sa on her breast, and her body began to glow a beautiful ruby-blue.
	
It was then that Borun Rockhard became the betrothed of Mirianna Starlight, Usil mage of Sa.  Borun, as well as Mirianna herself, knew that such a union was forbidden in the customs of their people.  They also knew, however, that the gods looked down upon their union with favor, and that in the end they must follow this path chosen for them.
	
So it was that Borun and Mirianna met on starlit nights in the wooded glen where he saved her life and accepted Sa as his savior.  Suspicions within the Hithual outpost grew as he would be gone for weeks at a time.  Indeed, it was thought by many that he had taken up the black arts, and that he performed the darkest sorcery within the confines of the magical wood.  His brother, Durik, hired many a Hithual scout to follow his brother and determine his whereabouts and actions, thus restoring his brother's name and eliminating the seed of dissent he felt growing within his camp,  but always the scouts came back empty handed, having lost the elder Hithual's tracks.  For Borun had long become crafty in his dealings with nature, and had learned the art of blending from his beloved wife.  
	
Eventually, the price of amber dropped dramatically, and downsizing of the mine began to take its toll on the Rockhard clan.  It was determined back at the Great Divide that all funding should be dropped on the project, and Durik himself was quick to pack up his belongings and return to the land he loved.  He was not unaware, however, of Borun's desire to stay behind, and when queried on the matter, Borun was sure to give a less than satisfactory reason.  Eventually, Durik began to himself believe the stories associated with his brother.  One night, awakened by some disturbing dream, he had seen the blue-ruby runestone which Borun wore around his neck, it's myriad light glowing upon the heaving chest of his sleeping brother.  
	
It was thus that Durik decided to follow his brother himself.  He had long ago become accustomed to his brother's sudden absences, and he had noticed a pattern in the comings and goings.  Having taken care of the orders for the mine that week, he set out into the dark woods, hoping that his brother would come to him, long after he had thought he had sideslipped any apparent spies.  The plan worked wonderfully, for Borun was too cognizant of those who might follow him from camp to be aware of someone that lay ahead of him, waiting to follow him to the glen and his beloved.
	
By the light of the moon Durik Rockhard watched his brother embrace the Usil Mirianna Starlight.  At first, Durik too was transfixed by her overwhelming beauty.  The rays of the moon glinted off of her silver hair like myriad veins of the precious metal in the rock below.  Her subtle glances, her delightful laughter, all tempted his with desire and longing.   But it was a foreign delight, and foreign delights are often misunderstood, and thus feared. Durik's fears and apprehensions grew by the minute, and he burst forth from the underbrush, startling both brother and bride.
	
"Brother, step back from that temptress.  She has obviously cast some sort of spell upon ye.  Step back, and let me end her vile treachery!", Durik bellowed.
	
Borun's response was calm, calculated,   "My Brother, I knew a time such as this would come.  I'm afraid however that the only spell cast upon me is the spell of love, and I embrace it's magical touch." 
	
Durik's mistrust grew by the moment.  He was sure that this Elf had charmed his brother, had tricked him into this love.  In the end, he knew that only by slaying her could he save his brother, and family, from the scandal that would ensue such a marriage.  Quickly, he drew his drathain war-blade and lunged at Mirianna.  
	
Borun was a wise Hithual.  He knew the turmoil that such a marriage as his would bring upon his family, and he read the mind of his brother as if it were printed in the air before him.  He also knew that although his brother was a great fighter, if need be he could forcibly stop any onslaught that might be brought forth.  As he watched his brother lunge forward, he readied his pearl shield and bolted to block the oncoming Hith.
	
The force of the shield momentarily stunned the younger Durik.  He was disoriented, sickened by the ensuing throbbing in his head, and bile filled his throat.  He looked with disbelief at his brother.
He shouted at his kin, "Brother, I cannot believe that you would raise an arm against your kin, especially over this Elven temptress!"

Borun's stoic expression did not reveal the torment within.  He spoke, his words hesitant at first, "Brother, I will not raise this axe against ye, or any of my kin, and yet this woman beside of me is my wife.  We have bonded, and our married in the eyes of our God.  Sa protects us.  His hand has blessed our souls and our union.  I will not let you harm her in any way."

With this, Borun threw his axe upon the ground, determined to harm his brother in no way.
Durik, seeing his chance, swung once again at his brother's companion.  The blow was well timed, and would have decapitated the young Elven woman save for one act.  As the blade neared its destination, Borun stepped in front of its path.  The blade clove deep, deep between the shoulder blade and the neck.  Borun fell to the ground, wounded mortally.

So it was that Borun Rockhard died that evening in the hands of both beloved and brother.  Numerous attempts to heal the dying Hithual were made.  Exhortations to Sa filled the air, and yet each went unanswered.  Raising his bowed head, Durik Rockhard slowly stood, walked into the forest, and disappeared.
	
Back in the Great Divide, word reached home as to the death of Borun, the disappearance of Durik, and the dealings with Mirianna.  A scroll with Mirianna's name herself appeared one day, explaining the happenings.  Those of Borun's line suddenly found themselves the object of ridicule and scorn.  Their lines of blood had been tainted, and they were to be banned, or bained, from those of Durik's line.  Thus they became known as those of Clan Bloodbaine.  Unable to stand the scorn and ridicule of their brethren, they packed their goods, moved to the Dark Forest, and settled there, fulfilling their obligations to the Hithual nation as guardians of its westernmost flanks.  
	
Over the centuries, the story of Borun and Durik has faded into the mists of time.  However, those of Borun's line still carry the name of Bloodbaine.  The rift between Clan Bloodbaine and Clan Rockhard has all but faded, and Clan Bloodbaine proved itself invaluable in the Goblin-al Wars which followed in later centuries.  Even today, Clan Bloodbaine occupies the far western reaches of the Great Divide, guarding the flanks of a nation that once banned it.  
	
It is said that Durik Rockhard traveled far and wide for many years, attempting to reconcile himself with the crime he had committed.  Some say that his voice can be heard in the forest today, lamenting the loss of his brother.  And some also say that the spirits of Borun and Mirianna bless the hidden glen in the Dark Forest.  This holy ground is the burial glen of clan Bloodbaine, forever blessed by the love of Sa.

Society Column
By Esper

Well, welcome to the Society Columns, pushed every step of the way by the evil editor type.. ::glances at the guilty party::

Anyway, here's Marigold's Prepared piece for Last week's recitals. I don't have the Spur of the Moment piece, Which Marigold also won.

So, presenting "Safer Than Love"
By Marigold Lyrian

How quickly beat thy tender heart,
How fragile doth it flutter,
A bird whose wings thrum desperately
Against these dark, drawn shutters.

How eagerly you claim to love,
How zealous is thy passion,
And yet how wrenched I find myself
To hear thy proclamation.

How do I long to hold you close,
But from thy touch I shiver;
So terrified my love entails
Far less than rapture's giver.

How frightened are we both, indeed,
To name our feelings "love" at all,
For love's a cruel and fickle thing,
'Tis best to stay far from its thrall.

Two strangers in the darkness,
Needing comfort, fearing love,
Imprisoned by their hungry souls,
They must live off less than enough.

Just wander with me, stranger hither,
Through the darkness stay e'er near,
But let us not reach out to touch,
For then we'd know our love is real...

How softly beat thy tender heart,
How fragile doth it flutter...
And yet, I must not open up
These dark, long-rusted shutters.


This week's competition was won in the Prepared category by Lunaris Glimmberbright the Dragon, with the piece "Enchantress Eternal."

As the moon glimmers bright    
In the skies overhead,    
There stands upon a rocky shore     
Were many hearts have bled,    
A tiny figure clad in white, who shivers in the winds,    
A creature garbed in fading light, from whom the demons cringe.    
She casts her eyes upon the waves    
So black, black midnight's calling,    
With trembling touch and ruby gaze,    
Fair hair o'er shoulders falling.    
Those ghostly fingers, pale ascending    
Grasp the ebbing shadow's crest,    
Weaving spells of spirit mending,    
By her hand, the heavens blessed.    
By the flicker of the starlight, wild daughters sing their songs,    
Ballads of a dying morning, balmy nights a century long.    
Wildfires on a windswept beach, a hyacinth embrace,    
Two ruby eyes so gentle, careful heart and radiant face.    
All these images a brief tableu, but comfort doth it bring,    
To know that deep into the night, this one shall always sing.    
On hither shore there stands alone, moon's shadow at her feet,    
An angel clad in fading light, who whispers, "Merry meet..." 


This week's Spur of the Moment topic was "Chivalry," and the winner was Fidget Dewdrop with this piece.

Chivalry charging,
To wrest the right from wrong.
Chivalry parading,
To sing its galant song.

In ancient halls,
With ancient walls,
In tombs enshrine,
Ideals sublime.

Chivalry meets,
With proud fierce eye.
Till proud,
Brave deed make them die.


Until next time!
