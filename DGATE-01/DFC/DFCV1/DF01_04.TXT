  Greetings fellow Spurians, and welcome to another issue of the DFC. Well, we are fully into the New Year, and as such, I thought it would be nice to offer an issue devoted to help a few Newbies. Yes, that dreaded creature which some of us avoid like the plague. Well, hopefuly some of them will read this issue, and perhaps learn a bit more about this place we all call home. In addition, we have Milanden Sa'Kar's anticipated top 5 of the Spur listing, as well as our usual assortment of fiction and fun. So, sit back, and enjoy.

  As I promised, the interview with the number one voted gladiator of the Governor's games.  It was fairly easy finding Acinonyx as she hunts with me from time to time, or she's out and about trying to help any of the little dragons that might have just arrived.  As it ended up, I ended up cornering her at Odds & Ends.  After confusing...er...coaxing her into staying and proceeding with the interview, she grunted and told me to get on with it. ;)

Being Acinonyx's second interview, she seemed a rather bit more nonchalant and open than I thought she'd be.  In fact, she didn't seem nervous at all.  Public speaking must be second nature to the Loremistress.  Anyways, on with the interview:


Milanden says, "This is...uhm...Me I guess"

Acinonyx raises an eyebrow.

Milanden says, "with the DFC, and I'm here with Acinonyx."

Milanden smiles.

Milanden says, "The Governor's games' voted number one gladiator"

Milanden says, "Acinonyx, how do you feel about this praise from the Spurians?"

Acinonyx says, "It was unsuspected"

Milanden says, "Why do you say that?"

Acinonyx says, "Well, as often as I'm sent to the green room, I didn't really think of myself as number one."
 
Milanden says, "Hmm...I believe it's because you are able to survive so long and kill the other gladiators"

Acinonyx says, "Perhaps it was my charisma that blinded them?"
 
Acinonyx whistles.

Milanden grins at Acinonyx.

Acinonyx says, "Don't you dare print that"

Acinonyx mutters something beneath her breath.

Milanden says, "Without the ability to hide or pray heal, I think it's pretty respectful."

Acinonyx says, "True."

Acinonyx says, "Perhaps because they have to gang up on me to take me down?"

Acinonyx sniffles.

Milanden grins.

Milanden says, "I know what you mean on that one"

(Milanden pulls out a piece of web stuck in his hair.)

(Acinonyx mumbles something about Jale the coward.)

Milanden says, "Do you have any comments on how what you think the games are like?"

Milanden says, "Or any suggestions on how to make it better and more enjoyable?"

Acinonyx says, "Well, they are  unbalanced....in several different angles."

Acinonyx says, "I've been turning an idea in my head for a new version of the games."

Acinonyx says, "What with the crowds these days."

Acinonyx shakes her head from side to side.

Acinonyx says, "Dragons are not even the most severely handicapped."

Milanden says, "How are they unbalanced, and what do you think could remedy..."

Acinonyx says, "Well, any one who has some kind of natural ability...confuse, web, draining...have an incredible advantage."

Acinonyx says, "Prayers are too easy to come by..."

Acinonyx says, "Runemages who can kill in one spell...with the aid of those prayers..."

Milanden nods.

Acinonyx says, "If Jale couldn't pray for strength, I don't think he'd be casting as many firespheres, for example."

Milanden grins.

Milanden says, "You really don't like Jale, do you?"

Acinonyx says, "He won't hunt anyone else until I'm dead."

Milanden says, "Would he be considered your archenemy?"

Acinonyx shakes her head from side to side.

Acinonyx says, "I've never even sought him out."

Acinonyx says, "But he follows me while pray hiding until I'm dead."

Milanden says, "Is there anyone that is your number one enemy in the games?"

Acinonyx says, "Half the arena"

Milanden laughs.

Acinonyx says, "There was a Leuian who always went after me...I asked him why..."

Acinonyx says, "He said cause he learned more from me than anyone else."

Acinonyx rolls her eyes.

Milanden grins.

Milanden says, "Do you have anything to say to your fans?"

Milanden grins.

(Milanden wonders if anyone made a sreaming Acinonyx-doll yet...)

Acinonyx says, "Thanks for voting me in.  I think I'll go paint a target on myself now..."

Acinonyx smiles.

                       The Story of Valentin'a

  Among the Hithual, as among many races, there are stories of legend,
fear, inspiration, etc.  This particular story is one of love, the kinda 
love that surpasses the fleshy, scaley, or winged folds of racial being.

  It was during the year of Colinth, or in the common tounge: the forge.
King Maldon, the explorer, had begun an incredible project of linking the isles of the north with vast underground caves.

  Trade had begun flourishing with the Drag-als, the Arachnians, and even some remote villages of Humans.  Unfortunately, several bands of brigands had become troublesome.  So, King Maldon had devised this project as a workable solution.

  It was during the month of Moltelth, that several miners had broken through to a vast cavern.  The Hithual miners were immediately stunned and blinded by a hill of gems, gold, and silver that lay upon a tiny isle in the middle of a small cavern lake.  Just as Grolthar, the leader of the miners, was going to approach this wealth, a heart-wrenching and peircing yell echoed throughout the cave.  Its source seemed to be some type of humanoid creature upon the treasured hill.
	
  "Where are you, my favored little companion?", came the voice upon the hill.

  "I's here Valentin," was the sound of a second yet unseen voice.

  "Ahhh...Cupyd, dear Secian friend, the time hath come.  I ask of you again, wilst thou become mine bondmate?"  The voice seemed racked in pain, yet soft and gentle as well.

  "Is always ready," came the little clear voice.

  Without warning, the Hithual began to feel the powers of arcane magics at work.  A little fearful, but always curious, Grolthar made his way to the edge of the lake.

  There, glowing in a warm hue of a multi-colored rainbow, was the smallest, winged creature he had ever seen.  This must be a Secian Gralthor thought to 
himself.

  Suddenly, the rainbow colors began to dance and play off the water and the many gems.  Dazzling to the point of blindness, Grolthar had to advert his eyes lest the image be the last he'd ever see.  At the same time, what sounded like a million, singing voices, began to fill the air with the sounds of joy and relief.  Just at the crescendo of lights and harmonic singing, two distinct and recognizable voices lifted above all others.  Though true, unimposed love, could never be truly described, these two voices sang that feeling with such magnifisence, that the Hithual miners felt tears of unabashed joy stream through their beards.  And then...It all stopped.

  Grolthar looked up to the hill of wealth and beheld a sight that would live in his eyes fer all his days.  A tiny, almost sparkling, winged Secian was delicately perched upon the might of a scaled, winged Drake.

  "Mes Valentin'a is alls better noos," came Cupyd's voice.
  
  "Thanks to thee, Cupyd."  Valentin'a's voice was powerful and confident.
  
  Grolthar led his miners away.  He then gave orders to reseal the entrance they had made to this cavern.  Another way around could be found, and Grolthar was not going to have anything disturb or spoil that perfect feeling and event he had beheld.

  This is one of the oldest, yet most well remembered stories of the Hithual race.

Graveyard Map and Key

O - Room
G - Gate
C- Crypt
#- refers to something if there is more than one (G1- gate 1)

  The Graveyard is pretty small, so dere's 'ittle risk of gettin lost if yer just explorin.  There are some unholy tings 'bout the graveyard, probally cause it's a graveyard.  
  To the west of the Gates, you will find the mass graves availible to the common folk. This is where all those who die and can not afford their own private burials are sent. For the most part, they are just thrown in pits, or left by the road to rot. It is truly sad to see the way these mortals sometimes treat their own kind. As you head west from the gates though, you will find the crypts becoming more elaborate and ornate. This is where those with money are buried...though I doubt they are any more restful then there poor bretheren to the West. For these departed souls have the added indgnity of having their crypts and graves routinely broken into by the more greedy inhabitants of this city we call home.
  Thus, tread with caution as you wander through dis place. For the mortals buried here are granted no peace...and no rest...


G1 - da first gate.  Dis is da gate yer gonna come through to enter da Graveyard.  (*autors note, G1, G2 and C are rooms dat have da gate or da crypt in dem)

G2 - dis the south gate fer da graveyard.  sometin unholy bout dis gate cause when ya walk thro it, it jest sticks ya right back in front of da gate, it leads nowhere.
(Editor's note: This gate once led out into the SPurian Hedgelands near 
                the old Forester's home. Due to some black Magick though,
                this gate has been shut fast, and will allow no one to 
                enter or leave the Graveyard through it. -Rags)

C1- Moonglum crypt. He was a teef or sometin dats been dead a longs time. Dis here crypt is a good 'lace to leaver yer pets.  Meanies never go here, less ya leads em in.  Also a good 'lace to take a date, if ya knows wot ah means...

C2- anudder one of dems unholy tings, leads no where.

Dere are odder Crypts, but nones ya kin enter like Moonglum's.  To da northeast of Moonglums is da slayers Crypt.  He was some 'ort of legend er sometin like dat.  To da northwest of da Slayer's crypt if Errol da assasisan.  Real intimidatin name,  musta been hard fer people to take 'im seriously wit a name like dat


Now's let me tells ya bout dem inhabitants of da Graveyard.  See fer some reason da dead don't like being disturbed, so if ya's in da greavyard, dey git mad and try to kills ya.  Well Ah'm here to helps ya make sure dey don't sucks ya down in to dere world.

Commone meanies - 

Rat - Dey seem to like to eat the newly dead.  If yer having 'roblems killing dese rats, den ya shouldn't be's here

Giant Rat - A larger Rat.  Very mean, dey don't take kindly to any sorts of person.  Careful wit dese guys dey have da ability to hurts ya

Skeleton - Walkin pile o bones.  Dey shouldn't be much of a problems, da one's wit da battle axes have da ability to do da most damage

Zombie - Walkin dead.  Very scary lookin wit puss oozin out and such.  A step up in difficulty from a skeleton, but 'till not dat hard

Ghoul - Ah don't know what hell dese tings came out of, but dey uglier den de underside of an arachnid, if ya's know what ah mean.  Dese tings are just about as hard as da zombie's

Ghost - well dey are ghosts, like da one's yer pappy used to tell you didn't live in yer house.  Dey spend most of dere time flying up and down.  If fer some odd reason dey do attack, don't git alarmed, dey'll just float back up sooner er later.  Dey not dat powerful but might take a 'ittle while ta kills.

Lesser Spirit - Ah spirit of sorts, ahm not big on brains so ah don't know what dey are.  Not much 'arder den a ghoul

Spirit - beefed up versions of dere lesser 'ounterparts.

Lesser Wight - Dese here tings kin hit ya's hard, ah always make sure to kill dese tings first.  dey are some sory of ghost type ting.

Wight - nasty critters, just a harder hittin lesser wight.

Shade- Altogh dese don't hit as hard as wight's,  dey are harder tas hit wit a weapon.  Ah'd approach dese tings wit small fire darts, of sometin of dat sort.

Rare Meanies-

Banshee - Acinonyx tells dat dese were once,  mages of da female gender.  Dey spend most dere time screaming at ya.  Dey not dat powerful, but dey might be a 'ittle 'ard to hit wit yer weapon.

Specter - Ah know little of dese, 'cept dat dey hit hard.

Greater Spirit - Ah if ya see's one's of dese don't try to fights it less you have a likin fer dying, or yer a really really good mage.  Ah know one little secian who likes to hunt dese and she kinna drag my 500 lbs body near one of dem tings less dey are dead


Dats bout it fer da meanies in da Graveyard, if ya's didn't notice ah listed dem in me opions order of easy to hard...Now ah'll tells ya of da treasure ya kin find here's

Rats n Giant Rats carry a whole lot of nottin

Skeletons - Flails, Hammers n'Battle axes.  Also carry pouches, wit a little bit o silver
 
Shades - Carry chests wit tons o money and a gem fer da secians.
(Editor's note: As of print time, the amount found in Shade's money chests 
                has been greatly reduced. Speculation is that Graverobbers
                have been getting to these restless creatures before we 
                adventurers, and have been stealing most of the Gold and 
                Silver which they once carried. -Rags)

Everyting else will eider have nottin or a pouch wit little bits o silver in dem.  Ghoulies carry a bit of gold, but nottin to git all excited 'bout.


Impalir's Ratins

Attacking strength of da meanies (over all)- low - wit good armor, you should barely feel anyting less ya come up against one of da Rare monsters, or  a spirit or Wight

Defence of da meanies(overall) - Okay  -  youngins below 6 or 7 in weapons maght have a problem hittin da meanies

Treasure rating - 2  if it weren't fer da shades, it would be 0

Magical defence of da meanies - none - All da meanies kin be afeected by magic

Magical attack of da meanies - none\low (ghosts attack with cold breathe, ahm goin out on a limb an calling dat a magic attack)


Key to mah system of rating:

None  Low   Okay   Good    Better    Great   Yer in trouble  

Treasure ratings is on a scale of 1 to 10

                    Adventure in de Training Grounds

  Hi yas folks.  I be Tisha LuckyStarre.  One day I were sittin in Town Squares, bored since nobody wanned ta play marbles wif me.  I kep lookin at dat silly arch, and finally found a little crack, jes big enufs fer me ta slip through!  So real quick, I run off, packed me self a lunch of peppermint sticks and a great big chocolate brownie dat Impalir gimme, and snuck tru da arch!  I went ta da place where folks starts out, all da way souf in da Trainin Ground, and soon as I gets dere I sees a nice new draggie, her name be Newbiette.  Befer anybody could see me, since I not sposed ta be in TG, I climbed inta her pocket and hid!  

  I tell ya now bout da adventures we hads! We started at a place where it say dat  north be a city and east be da Spurian Academy.  Well, da Academy weren' dere when I were in da TG, so I tickled Newbiette till I gots her ta take me dere!  We goes ta da east, and dere was a red cedar sign, a brown cedar sign, and a white one.  Newbiette looked puzzled, she tried ta LOOK AT SIGN, and it says dere be writin on it!  I tinks, ne'er bein in school yets, Newbiette not used ta readin tings, so I whispers in her ear, 'READ SIGN', and she does dat.  Da firstes sign tells ya how ta read da udder signs! READ 1 SIGN, READ 2 SIGN, and so ons.   Da next one tells ya how ta uses help! Course, Newbiette bein a curious draggie, had ta tries it.  Da sign say ta do HELP.  Well, ya knows, when  ya does HELP, it tell ya how ta get more pacific help on all kinds o' stuffs.  I gets out a peppermint stick fer a snack, while Newbiette be readin.  Two peppermint sticks later, I startin ta werry dat wif all da learnin ya can finds in HELP, gonna run out o' peppermints befer she be done.  So, I says, "Newbiette, how bout we see what ya learns at da 'cademy, den after ya can looks some mores fer what ya didn' learns."  I had ta nudge her a bits, but after a while, she reads ta lastest sign, and it say ta go North fer yer tour o' da area. 

  So we go north, and by readin da signs learns dat da 'cademy be organized by CLASS.  Welpers, dese class not be like ones in schools, dey be like runemage, or fighter.  Newbiette looks confused agains.  She say she not has a CLASS, she draggie.  Welp, I tinks draggie gots more class den anybodies. But no matters, da sign tell ya dat  in dese lands ya can learns skills from udder classes.  So, Newbiette still curious an wantin ta learns everytin she cans decides dat we visits all da places in Academy.  I tinks she berry smart draggie ta do dat, but den I tinks bout da nummer tings ya can learns, an starts countin on me fingers.  Even dough I knows Newbiette should looks at everytins, I decides dat much schoolin could be dangerous ta me healf, an I might wanna sneaks off befer she dones.  So, I gives Newbiette me bestes li'l smile so me dimples shows and asks her real nice, can we go ta da where magickers learns firstes? Terns outs she likes magicks too, an she also real interested in dem silly weapon tings, so we decides ta go look at runemage and fighter stuffs first.  

  So, all decided on what we gonna do, we go tru a great big golden door! Follerin da signs we go up some stairs, and dere we learns how ta weaves and casts a spell at a target.  Newbiette is tickled pinks when she casts her first rune, and casts it a few times tryin real hard ta bern down da smolderin target wif fire darts.  Dat target be stubborns!  I hears a story dat all da younguns keeps on tryin, cause ya gets ta marry a prince or princess if ya does.  A drag-al tolds it ta me, and sometimes dey 'zaggerates.  But Newbiette don' know yet dat lots o' folks been tryin bern dat target down, an nobody done it yets, so she ask me how she get better at channelin so she can does it.  So I tells her, ta do SKILL.  Nex ta each skill dere be a nummer.  When dat nummer get ta zero, ya go trains, an dat how ya gets better.  By now, dis draggie made her self real comfortable, an sometimes it be hards ta make a draggie move when dey does dat, so I whispers ta dis Thugian mage sittin nex ta her.. can ya gives her a li'l shove? Wif a grunt, dis feller gives her such a push we bof go flyin tru da portal, and lands at da bottom o' da stairs where we started.  

  Nex place we goes is ta where fighters learns.  Dey gots dere berry own shop in da 'cademy.  It sells weapons an armor made jes fer practicin, and everytin dere costs only one coin and weighs only one pound!  So, she gets a practice sword, and a set of giant practice armor.  (All da armor weigh and costs da same, so smart draggie dat she is, she get giant armor, which also turn out ta be da bestes one deres.)  Den we goes ta practices agains.  Dis time we sees funny targets! Dey red an white like peppermints, but dey spits and stares and glances!  Newbiette readies her sword, and swings at dat 3rd target lots o' times, checks SKILL, and see she learnt somethin.  She figgers dis mebbe a pretty good way ta learn until she feel ready ta do some real huntin.  After a while she gets tired o' da 3rd target, and starts attackin anudder one.  Den she notices sumpin.  She not be learnin nuffin when she hits dis target.  She ask me what wrong and I dunno.  Well dere be dis great big Oog-ra sittin nex ta us, killin targets wif a sword he holdin wif his pinky.  He looked like he knowed his way round dis sort o' ting, so Newbiette asks him.  He grunts at her and say 'target finish'. "What he meant to say, is that each target, and each creature you hunt has a certain ammount of uses.  So, the targets get used up, and you cannot learn from them.  When you cannot learn, your feet grow big, but I have a solution for that, this cobbler I know.... ", began this drag-al, who den went on ta tell us da story o' dis cobbler dat makes magickal shoes.  Befer we knowed what were goin on, he went right inta anudder story, bout da kingdom where dis cobbler has his shop, and knowin he might go on ferever, I curtsies and says we gots ta be on our way.  Welp, da part about da uses terns out ta be true.  'Cept I hears dat only werk fer some skills; magicks be different, ya can keeps practicin on same target less it get deads.  Da li'l draggie den pulled out a harmonica an starts playin dis happy li'l tune, so I pops out her pocket and starts dancin about, and Newbiette starts tappin her foot.. but it not wif da beat o' da music.  I realizes she gettin impatient. I dunno what fer, but she wanna go looks at da cleric stuffs, and I havin much too good a time ta go anywheres, so she say she come back ta get me when she done wif lookin bout da 'cademy.  I danced till me feets and me wings gots all tuckered outs, an den listened ta stories, and finally Newbiette comed back fer me.  She visited everywheres and learnt lots.  She says dere be stuff in some guilds dat be useful fer everybodies.   

  By dis time, I had more dan nuf school, and was near out o' peppermints, so we decideswe goes back where we started and den venture inta da city. I puts on me pinafore while Newbiette brushes me hair, den I borrows a bit o' wax from some local bees and we shines up her practice armor, so we can looks our bestes fer meetin new folk in town.  I fishes tru me pockets and finds a crumpled ol map from las time I been ta dis place, and it all stuck tagedder wif a half eaten peppermint patty I saved in it long time ago. So I tucks it back in me pocket real fasts, and tells her 'stead o' usin me map, we needs gets her one since she be here a whiles.  I tells her go ta da Main Graphical Menu fer Dragon's Gate.  Den looks in da ARCHIVES, and get da map of da Trainin Grounds.  Knowin dat she be a berry smart draggie, dat wants ta know what be what, I tells her while she dere, she be'er picks up da Dragon's Gate Manual, and da Dragon's Gate Policy.  

  Newbiette goes off and comes back wif all dat stuffs, and I has ta tears da manual out her hands, cause once she discovers how much learnin be in it, I sure she gonna be dere all day.  I climbs back inta her pocket, and off we goes, headin north ta town!  Firstest ting, I tells her find da bank.  So we go seven north ta Trainin Ground Square, den all da way west, jes like on da map.  I tells her ta TRANSACT and deposits all her monies except mebbe 300 coins, cause she gonna needs it later.  (What I seen later made me tinks it mebbe a good idea ta deposits all yer silvers befer ya go ta 'cademy.)  Dis also be a place where ya can keeps stuffs in a locker, and it be a magickal locker! In Spur dere more dan one bank, and any bank ya be at, Spur or TG, yer locker dere waitin wif yer stuff wifout ya e'en tellin em yer comin!  Course I wants ta windown shops, so I talks Newbiette inta visitin every shop and see what dey has.  

  First we go General Store, and dey gots lots o' kinds o' torches and lanterns.  I likes torches, but lanterns gots be careful, not good use or wear metal if ya uses magicks.  But I gots me firefly Winkie dat come wif me everywhere and lights da way when darks out, and Newbiette see in da darks.  So I asks Mr. Otis Thornberry why his store don't has peppermint sticks.  Seems he don't care much bout peppermint sticks, so we moves on and goes ta da Jeweler.  Mr. Tellabur catches me puttin me nose up gainst da diamonds 'splay case, and smudgin it, so we leaves quick.  I tells Newbiette we come backs if we gets gems ta sells.  

  Next we goes herbalist, alchemist and apofecary. Alchemist not opens, but da udders gots roots, leafs and potions.  Newbiette don' unnerstan what dese tings be fer, and I tells her vigor be fer energies and health.  I tells Newbiette ta do HEALTH.  She do and see she gots FTG and HP, and I tells her if ya runs out FaTiGue, ya can't move or do anyfin, and if ya runs out Health Points, ya gets dead.  I tink da ecru potion at da Apothecary fer Psycians, but I Secian, dunno what glowheads needs.  Sumbody tell me it be fer Psi Points dat gives dem dere glow powers.  

  Den we go healer.  Mian heals ya fer a price, so I lies down on da table, and she pass her hand o'er me while holdin a metal ting dat hummed.  She get mad at me cause I not herts, so wif me ears still ringin from dat metal ting, Newbiette an me leaves an goes ta da Armory.  Da armory be a place dat buy and sell all kind o' stuff!  Anytin ya finds on critters when ya hunts cept sparklies and monies, ya sells in dis place.  Dis also be da place ya can buy weapons, shields and armor. We tries on all da hats, and Newbiette puts on dis giant fur cap dat make her looks real sfistcated, so decides mebbe we come back later and gets it so she got sumfin ta wear fer a night out on da town.  While we tryin on hats we runs inta a new li'l cleric named Whyspr, tryin on some lovelies silk robes.  She ask me how she get ta temple, and Newbiette proudly unrolls her map and says we takes her ta temple.  

  We goes back ta TG (dat be what folk call da Trainin Ground) Square, and starts goin north agains, ta where da temples be, and I notices Newbiette slowin down somes, tryin ta figger her map.  Now she be draggie, and draggie be so special dey don' has ta werships gods, so she be lookin at her map an see sevens temples! Proud as she were bout usin her map and showin da way, she didn' wanna say she didn' knows where ta goes, so I whispers at her, look at da li'l cleric!  She looks and dere she see da mark o' Elindal, and off we go ta Elindal temple.  Well Whyspr gets ta temple and her li'l eyes fills up wif tears.  I asks her what be wrongs an she say she so happy ta be in da temple o' her god da first time!  Den she ask me what she do here.  I tells her dat I mage, so please don't tinks no desrespects me sayin soes, but I tinks our gods be kinds o' matrilistics, dey wants monies befer we can prays fer stuffs.  Da way ya do it is ya come ta temple wif monies and ya KNEEL, den ya DONATE.  After ya done dat, ya can pray two ways.  Ya can comes ta temple and KNEEL, den PRAY, and yer god tells ya what stuffs ya can pray fer.  Some tings, like blessin armors and weapons, ya can only do in da temple.  Newbiette who was busy pickin lint out her pockets, gots interested in dis part an says "You can bless weapons and armor?".  And I tells her yeppers, up ta four times, and it makes em be'er, but ya can buys lots o' peppermint sticks fer what it cost ta blesses stuffs.  Best o' all, I tells Newbiette, ya can blesses stuffs fer udder folks, so if she get a weapon, e'en dough she draggie and has no temple, I can blesses it fer her at Sa place!  Den I tells Whyspr dat if ya follers a god, ya can also pray fer stuff when ya not in temple, and Newbiette start studyin her map.  I gives Whyspr 100 silvers and tells her to donates it, den I tells her do INFO RELIGION.  And she see she gots favors!  I tells her ya donates ta gets favors, and it costs favors ta prays.  I tells her dere be two very important prayers I wants her ta remember.  Da firstest one be PRAY <godname> HEAL <target>.  Dat gives da target back healf, real fasts.  Da udder one be PRAY <godname> STRENGTH <target>.  Dat one gives target energies.  But 'members, dese tings costs silvers, and clerics needs dere silvers ta gets Devoted.  She ask me what be 'Devoted', but by dis time Newbiette were startin ta play wif some fragile li'l relics she founds on a shelf and I tinks we be'er gets out o' here befer she break sumfin, and I hugs Whyspr and tells her finds a cleric, I mage, I dunno much bout dats.  Just as I says this, Newbiette carefully as she can tries pickin up a li'l statue o' a wolf, and I sees da back o' her paw be much too close ta da one o' Elindal, so I flies up an catches it jes as Newbiette knocks it off da shelf. I sets it back straight and start pushing at Newbiette to leave, I figgers I be'er takes Newbiette out dis place, and asks if she wanna go huntins.  She starts hoppin ups and downs all 'cited bout goin on her first hunt till da whole temple shooked, so I climbs back in her pocket and off we goes!  

  Newbiette be lookin at her map and I tells her finds da three gates north o' da town, dey leads ta da huntin areas.  I wants ta see if any li'l ones be rounds, so I asks her if we can go far north as we cans, wifout goin tru da gate.  We gets dere, and finds all kinds o' folks!  I tells Newbiette dis be good place ta gets healed, rests and meets folks.  Dere be clerics here practicin dere healins and lots o' folks learnin First Aids.  It be a good place ta learns how dis be done, practices, asks bouts stuff, and makes new friends.  

  Den I tells her bout da three gates.  Da one ta north be ta da cemetary, it hard ta hunts in dere, we don't go less we go wif lots o' folks dat knows how.  Da one ta da west gots trolls, and forest creatures.  Trolls gots chests wif sparklies and silver and gold, but dey berry hard ta hunt.  Not good fer first day.  We decides go ta da one ta da east.  Dat one got rogues and rats and such.  We gets lucky and right 'way we finds a rogue!  Well Newbiette readies her sword, and starts swingin.  She knocked it back once, den agains and agains till finally it get near deads, and she near all out o' energies, when some Thug comed along and takes one swing and it be deads. Den he strips it! And he takes da treasures and goes off. Welpers, he didn' reads da what Mr. Milanden wrote in last DFC abouts huntin manners.  Ya ne'er swings on somebody elses prey less ya ask firsts if dey wants help and dey says yes.  Ya ne'er strip somebody else prey, and ya ne'er takes somebody else treasure.  Newbiette werked so hards, was too tuckered outs ta hunts more till she rests, and den her treasures gets taked. Dis were one unhappy draggie.  

  Den we sees sumbody attackin a li'l poor child! It were a street urchin.  I starts sobbin, and Newbiette gets mad.  See, Newbiette got da good sense ta knows dat ya don't attack nuffin dat don' attacks ya first.  All dese places we hunts has townsfolk, and pretty creatures dat ne'er bodders ya.  Newbiette says stop killin da poor li'l child! But da child gots kilt, and stripped, and den da guards comed out.  Dat what happen when folks attacks innocents, da watch get riled, and guards comes out and kills adventurers.  Poor Newbiette gets kilt by da guards and she didn' do nuffins wrongs.  Dere be a good ting about bein new, fer da first tirty days, ya jes DEPART, and come back good as new! But don't do it after tirty days, or ya loses yer learnins.  Dere also be sumfin bout insurance, it cost 300 coin, and I hears ya should has it, and ya can only buys it when ya deads.  Remember da 300 coins I tolds Newbiette ta keeps when we go bank? Yep! I tells her buy insurance, ya needs it fer when ya gets deads.  So she DEPART, buy insurance, and come back good as new, but flamin mads.  So we goes off ta finds dis feller killin li'l childrens, and Newbiette says she gonna makes him stop.  We catches up wif him and he say he don' wanna stops, he gets treasures dis way.  He disarm and take stuff from innocent townfolks.  Jest bout now a khat named Honore comes alongs, and he hears what be goins ons an he starts growlins and gettin mads.  He ask dis feller, "Do you want to behave disgracefully? Yours are the actions of a thief and murderer of children."  Well da feller snickers and runs off.  Jest bout dis time dere be a message from da elders writ across da sky sayin dat stealing from udder players or attacking them in the Training Ground means ya gets sent immediately ta da Spur.  So I asks Honore, does dat means dat in dis place folks can steal yer treasures, and werst o' all, attack innocent townfolk and creatures and nobody can stops ems?  Honore says not while he be round, puffs up his chest, bows, and goes off lookin ta, um, 'educate' he says, da feller killin urchins.  So Newbiette and me go off ta hunt some more.  Welpers, almos all her treasures gots took by poachers, and she gots kilt by guards two more times.  Ya knows, when I were new, da TG were a place ya makes very special friends, like Miss Athene, and Miss Deidlet, who e'en dough I don' keeps up much as I shoulds, we always has sumfin specials.  I gots berry sad, and we stopped huntins.  

  Newbiette asked why I so sads, and I telled her I tinks all ya learns bout huntin in dis place is how ta be rude, steal, poach, and kill innocents.  I says lets go back 'cademy and get some learnin so ya can trains.  I tells Newbiette, I tinks da TG now be a good place ta go ta 'cademy, and practice wif targets ta gets ready fer huntin, mebbe gets 3 or 4 levels o' everytin, and learn new skills. But den prolly go ta Spur, it much safer.  If folks acts bad in Spur, udder folks stops em, so dere be less poachin and ya almost never gets kilt by guards.   

  She ask me bout what I means by learnin new skills, and so we goes back and plays wif silly targets till she can gets her first trainin, den we go guild place.  The TG has one guild place fer all classes, so it easy ta figger outs.  I tells her bring 900 coins from bank.  We plays wif da silly targets till she gets ta her first trainin in sharps, and den goes ta guild.  I tells Newbiette, first train in sharp. Since she new, dat take no time, and it cost 150 coins fer trainin.  Well, she go off wif trainer, and comed right backs all done!  Next I tells her she gots sumfin hards ta do.  She need ta go way fer 2 days, cause dat how long it take ta learn new skill.  I tell her go learns First Aid.  Anybody not cleric has ta knows its, and it real hard ta learns, so best gets it right away.  Befer she go, I tell her it good idea ta adds new skills she gonna wants while she in TG, since skills not of yer class costs more ta learns in Spur, and fer draggies, dat be all skills.  I took da fudge brownie Impalir gimme out me lunch pack, and tucked it in Newbiette's pocket so she has snack fer school, den climbed up out her pocket and onta her shoulder and gived me new friend a big hug.  I were gettin sleepies and it were time fer me go back ta Spur, so I says goodbyes ta Newbiette.  I sneaked back trough da crack in da arch and went ta Sa place ta curls up wif me firefly Winkie and goes ta sleeps.  I sad ta say goodbye ta me friend Newbiette, but I know she come Spur soons, and I promised I meets her at da arch.  Mebbe ya folks comes wif us fer her first day in Spur when da next DFC come out.  

                       May yer dreams be filled wif magicks

                               Sage Advice
				
  Let me pass on to thee, newcomer to Spur, some advice that I have learned while travelling within the realms.
  As ye have just recently come to the Spur, some of the most important questions on yer mind are probably:  Where can I make money, Where is it safe, Where is the weapons shop, where is my guild, etc.  Now, It would take a book to tell ye everything, but, I will try to answer as many of these troublesome problems as I can.
  Since ye art but a beginner in the fair city of Spur, it would be a safe guess that ye not ready fer the arena or the haunted house. A great place to make some quick silvers, is the area called the rogue fields.  This is located in the Eastern Hedgelands (ye do have maps right?).  Do not attempt to go out the southern gate of the Hedgelands as there are very dangerous brigands there.  Practice yer magic, weapons, martial arts, disarming, whatever on these helpless do badders of society.  Then reap yer rewards by taking their weapons and selling them at the nearest curio shoppe.  
  This shoppe is located in the Merchant's Guild (ye do have maps right?).  The best curio shoppe to sell at is the one located in the Merchant's Bazaar.  This is located one east of the bank there. Now I know that some of ye have tried to haggle with these hard-nosed, silver-penching, robbers who call themselves merchants.  Always seems easier to just speed haggle with them and take the price they give ye. Well...I am going to give ye some tips on how to cheat these con artists back.  When trying to haggle sabers or battle-axes, A good place to start is around 500 silvers.  With flails and hammers around 1400 and dirks around 1600 should also give ye a good start.  Then begin to reduce yer price by 50 silvers until the 'merchant' agrees with ye.  This does take a little extra time, but it adds up after a while.  Now let's spend that hard earned coinage.
  The Mages guild located in the Guild Distrisct (ye do have...well ya know), is where all striving young spellcasters, this includes ye fighters and thieves, go to buy their runes.  There are roughly a 100 runes to chose from, but, ye must know what to ask fer when ye get there. I'll let ye have the fun of discovering what ye can get.
  The weapons and armor shops are luckily located right next to that bank ye trusted yer extra spending silvers in.  Again haggling can be tiresome but well worth it.  
  Fer ye priests, there is the wonderful duty of devoting to yer god. This is costly but brings great rewards.  Every young worshipper starts out in life as a Noviviate follower.  As ye donate silver to yer god, this status will change.  At around 5000 favors from yer diety, ye become a Charitable follower.  Double that and ye have the distinct pleasure of becoming a Loyal follower, now is when ye are granted a gift of skill from yer lord:  Turn Undead.  Double that again, and ye become a Loved follower. At 30,000 favors after that ye can become devoted.  Now ye have the ability to raise the dead, or as it is called rezzing.  By the way, ye lose whatever favors ye have obtained when ye move to another status. 
  Another great area to vistit is the Artificer's Guild also located in the Guild District.  They can provide an almost endless supply of materials to custom build any type of armor or weapon ye seek.  This includes everything from common grass to molybdeum.  Don't trust the cost to be reflective of the protection.  Gold does not protect well...But, it looks nice.
  And finally, if ye have spent yer million silvers at all these places,
ye can go back to the Mages Guild and start buying rare herbs.  These herbs raise yer strength; gives ye better dexterity and agility; they can also raise yer intelligence.  However, these potions can be very pricey. They run about 50,000 silvers per dose.  There is one herb here that is not only cheap but is very important:  Reduxa.  Buying several of these leaves and eating them just before training, does wonders fer yer ability to carry more weight, as well as increasing yer chances of staying alive. The reduxa runs about 500 per leaf.
  I hope that these helpful words can help ye as much as they helped 
me throughout my adventures.  I will leave ye with a few phrases that are
common in the Spur:

"Meet me at the closet"--This is the skeleton closet in the Haunted House.
"We are going to the rogue fields"--That area I told ye about in the 
Hedgelands.
"The Mazes are busy tonight"--This is the Thieves' Maze in the Poor 
Quarter.  When ye can handle rogues with a yawn, try this area out.
"Sparklies"--Gems obviously, but ye will usually only here Secians say this
By the way, giving yer gems to Secians is probably one of the wisest 
ideas I have found.  Secians love to heal people.
"Yjod od s gptorm ksmhishr"--Somebody speaking a different language. Duh!
"Soros is here"--RUN!
And ifn ye come to a gate within the Spur that is always open, and is 
closed this time, check yer pockets.

Familiar 101- The Semi-Complete Guide to Familiars

  One of the most valuable resources available to adventurers in the 
Spur are the magical companions known as familiars.  They often appear to 
be simple pets, but the truth is that they're far, far more.  The bond 
between a familiar and it's master, forged with arcane magicks, goes beyond 
simple friendship.  It is a symbiosis, a partnership where each member 
benefits from the unique capabilities of the other.

Making the Match
  For years the citizens of the Spur have been trekking out the southern 
city gate and then down the eastern Farm Road to visit the Companion's 
Place, the premier source for familiars in the realms.  It's a family 
business run out of the back room of the Longbow family home, but don't 
let that fool you.  Woodsy Longbow is a respected professional who's skill 
is attested to by the thousands of happy clients that have walked out his 
door.
  Once you've entered his shop you'll be amazed at the variety of animals 
available.  The room is filled with the scents and sounds of dozens of 
animals and every inch of free space seems to be taken up by cages filled 
with creatures from around the globe.  If you know what you're looking for 
Woodsy will be able to tell you if it's available from memory, but he's 
more than happy to walk about describing the attributes of each familiar 
in loving detail.
  While you're talking he'll be sure to ask you exactly what you want from 
your familiar.  Is the endurance enhancing ability of the familiar your 
primary concern?  Are you looking for an extra pair of eyes?  Do you just 
want a playful companion?  Answer these questions and your choice will be 
clear.


A Mingling of Souls
  Most familiar owners purchase a pet to supplement their own vitality.  
The unique nature of the familiar bonding process links your lifeforce with 
that of the animal and allows you to transfer energy from it just by 
reaching out and touching the animal. In effect, the familiar acts as a pool of energy from which you can drink when you're thirsty and tired.  The larger the physical size of the familiar the larger the pool of lifeforce from which you can draw. 
  Unfortunately, the pool isn't bottomless.  Every time you transfer energy 
from your familiar the level of the pool goes down a bit.  Unless the 
animal has time to recover each successive transfer will be smaller and
smaller, until finally, the animal is unable to give you any energy at all.
During an extended battle this steadily declining transfer rate can leave 
you gasping for strength and force you to withdraw.  One way to speed the 
animal's recovery of lifeforce is to order it to lay down.  Another more 
intensive method is to have a friendly runemage cast a vigor spell on it.
  One of the least understood aspects of this transfer of lifeforce is why 
it seems to work for some owners better than others.  It's an accepted fact 
for some that the longer you own a familiar the more lifeforce it will be 
able to share with you.  What isn't clear, even after all these years of 
study, is why certain people seem to get more energy than others from the 
same species of familiar.  Is it some inherent characteristic of the owner? 
Or is it simply something that varies from animal to animal?  The sages 
continue to ponder these questions, but for now we have no definite answer.


I'll Be Seeing You
  The second most popular use for familiars is as scouts.  The bonding 
magic allows you to concentrate and see a brief image in your mind of what 
the animal is seeing at it's current location.  By directing your 
familiar's travels you can use this ability to scout out dangerous 
locations before risking your life, check to see if your favorite thief is 
hanging out between you and the bank, locate dead adventurers, and explore
areas you haven't been to before.  Some bounty hunters are even known to 
use their familiars with the services of a skilled Psycian to track the 
location of outlaws on the run.
  The main drawback of this ability is that the image is static.  While 
you can see the area around the animal, and anyone in it that isn't hidden, 
you can't see what they're doing.  At times this has led to 
misunderstandings when a helpful adventurer uses his familiar to see a 
group with several unconscious members on the ground.  Assuming the worst 
they rush to help, only to find that the party was simply resting and 
taking a quick nap to refresh themselves.

Other Uses
  One of the more innovative uses for familiars is as translators.  Since 
all animals with the gift of speech use the Common tongue it's possible for 
the pseudo-mute races (Monitanians, Arachnians) to speak through them.  
Messages conveyed by thought aren't limited by any language barriers, as 
our good friends the Psycians have demonstrated, allowing familiars to 
convert the mental messages of their masters into speech understandable by 
all.  

Master Familiar Chart
  The chart is laid out with the familiars in ascending order of cost.  
Prices are given in silvers.  Fatigue is the number of fatigue points the 
average user can expect to transfer when the animal is well rested.  Note 
that your actual amount may vary, but the number given should be within 
one point of the Fatigue available.  

Special abilities are abbreviated as:
(P)erch- The animal can perch on your shoulder.
(F)- Flying.  The familiar is capable of flight.
(S)- Speech.  The animal can talk.

Combat Strength is a measure of the animal's ability to inflict damage in 
comparison to other familiars.  The ratings of Low, Medium, and High are 
necessarily vague because of the nature of DGate's combat system, but 
should provide a reliable gauge of how the different beasts stack up.

Animal           Price         Fatigue      Abilities     Combat Strength

Toad             625             6             P                 Low

Familiar Commands

FAMILIAR GO <direction>- Moves the familiar in the direction specified.  
Some features, such as gates and doors, are difficult for them to navigate 
so be sure to specify which door they should travel through (FAMILIAR GO 2 
DOOR).

FAMILIAR LOOK- Provides you with a mental image of what the familiar is 
seeing.  The image allows you to see what and who is in the area, but can't 
determine what actions they're taking.

FAMILIAR ATTACK <target>- Commands the familiar to attack the specified 
target.  Creatures will usually ignore a familiar, but once they've been 
attacked by one they'll begin fighting it.  This is a great way to get your 
familiar killed and cause a considerable amount of backlash damage to 
yourself.

FAMILIAR STOP- Tells the familiar to stay in it's current location.  It's 
a good idea to leave it in a peacebonded area in order to prevent some 
recent arrival from attacking it.

FAMILIAR SAY <message>- Familiars with the ability of speech will repeat 
the message you give them exactly.  If you leave your familiar in the town 
square this ability can be very useful if you get into trouble, as in "The 
raven says "My master Ttrrachkchirrkk is lying dead amongst the demons!  
He needs a cleric!"

FAMILIAR CONTACT <target> <message>- Allows you to send a message to a 
particular person via the ESP abilities of a familiar.  Currently not 
implemented.

FAMILIAR TRANSFER-  Transfers fatigue points from your familiar.  The 
amount transferred depends on the size of the animal and it's current state 
of fatigue.  Can range up to 21 points per transfer for a well rested 
destrier, but will always be at least 1 point from even the most exhausted 
of beasts.

FAMILIAR FLY- Sends familiars with the ability to fly up into the air.  
May decrease the amount of fatigue available for transfer.

FAMILIAR LAY- The familiar lays down and rests.  Increases the animal's 
fatigue recovery rate, and hence the number of fatigue points available 
for transfer.

FAMILIAR STAND- Commands the animal to stand up.  Familiars must be 
standing in order to use the FAMILIAR GO or FAMILIAR FOLLOW commands.

FAMILIAR PERCH- Tells the familiar to crawl onto your shoulder.  In order 
for it to take effect the familiar must be in the same room as it's master.

FAMILIAR RECALL- Summons the familiar to your current location.

                          Rise of the Classes

It's been a while since we've had a peek into the underworld and within that time, the thieves have been busy.  I would first like to welcome all the newcomers (11-30) to the Rise of the Classes.  Several of the thieves have fallen out of the top ten, including the one time Guidemaster, Dashe.  Broma has slipped from the 5 spot down to 13, but he has been seen recently in the lands.  What of the others?  Lahr, Kveldulf, Snatch, Gollum, Toloren, and Kharimar have all seemed to vanish...  Perhas they picked one too many pockets?  

In our Top Ten we have the Webspinner who, before returning to his Matriarch, dominated the Guild and still holds strong.  Only Gavin remains of the original guild members and continues to enjoy the clean-up position, 4.  New to the Top Ten, we welcome Orchist, Laeta, Fearagoh, Nataar, Chel, Edwyrick, Vagn, and Fuurrdy in spots 2, 3, 5-10, respectively.

1: Ttrrachkkichrrk Artakkatrrk the Arachnian Rank 
2: Orchist Lichlord the Leuian Rank 
3: Laeta Silkspinner the Arachnian Rank 
4: Gavin Swordsbane the Go-blin Rank 
5: Fearagoh Stalberdin the Human Rank 
6: Nataar TheNimble the Leuian Rank 
7: Chel Vanin the Go-blin-al Rank 
8: Edwyrick Killworth the San Elf Rank 
9: Vagn Holmskalle the Leuian Rank 
10: Fuurrdy Forg the Flerian Rank 
11: XFLEX ALASX the Human Rank 
12: Snatch Fastfingers the Go-blin-al Rank 
13: Broma Litefingers the Go-blin-al Rank 
14: Ilusian Soulbinder the Leuian Rank 
15: Dashe OManiac the Go-blin Rank 
16: Ryff Raff the Leuian Rank 
17: Fofrin Pillownapper the Flerian Rank
18: Raldus Yennet the Flerian Rank 
19: Lahr Morahn the Leuian Rank 
20: Tryxter Finkk the Go-blin-al Rank 
21: tasslehofff burrrfooot the Flerian Rank 
22: Toloren Hassid the Leuian Rank 
23: Snowfreak BlizzardMaker the Leuian Rank 
24: Ghuej Usteye the Leuian Rank
25: Playtime Quickfeet the San Elf Rank 
26: Kveldulf Bloodspiller the San Elf Rank
27: Targus Darkshadow the Flerian Rank 
28: Verso Tecro the Anthian Rank 
29: Magcyan Dither the Leuian Rank 
30: Laetherleggs the-Low the Go-blin-al Rank 



It is well known that the Spur is the hub of trade and commerce, travellors and new residents.  Many come to the Spur t omake a name for themselves, then move on in the world, and some decide to remain.  This can be reflected by taking a look at the thieves' polar opposites, the Heart Clerics.  

Once again, I welcome all who have joined the Rise of the Classes in the new slots of 11-30.  Coming out of no where, we have Viderian, the Psycian who has blown by all the Secian folk.  It's obvious this young healer knows where his future lies.  Monticath has moved from 4 to the 2 slot and is just edged by the newcomer on the Top Ten, Berial.  Thistleroot, after a rocky start, comes back strong, moving up five notches to take the 4 spot.  Tula has dropped from 3 to 6 and Leriet...where is she?  She's dropped from the Guildleader position all the way to number 9.  New to the Top Ten, I'd like to welcome Est, Caitharo, Rixinon, and Pebbella, in spots 5, 7, 8, and 10 respectively.  Way to go!

1: Viderian Saverhaven the Psycian Rank 
2: Monticath AIlimair the Secian Rank 
3: Berial Ambrosius the Secian Rank
