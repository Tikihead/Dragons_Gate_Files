Citizens of Spur,

We are sadden by the loss of a Spurian, Slide. His loss to the senseless greed and pettiness of Mankind comes ill to my thoughts. My condolences go out to the widow and child he was forced to leave behind. I hope Justice is swift and painlessly. It is a sad time, and this issue shall be his.

Well, it seems that it's just getting bigger and bigger. This issue, we have new staff joining the team. 

The DFC is going through some cosmetic changes thanks to the Mad Dog, so now it's time for a few more changes. This DFC is a special Spooktacular of sorts..so enjoy.

I have decided to bring on a few more regular staff to the DFC, so please welcome a few faces you will see more of in the DFC, as you are most likely familiar with them in Spur.

I have brought on a new Assistant Editor, Marigold. She has contributed much to the community of Spur and will continue my legacy when I am gone, whenever that day comes.

I have also brought on some regulars. And just because they whined a lot about it, did not in any way influence my choice to offer them jobs, I just felt like it. Please welcome Frason, Aubrei, and Esper to the DFC Staff. I'm not sure what that really means to them, as they surely won't get anything from me, accept scorn, abuse, and ridicule. Well, for now, this will be it. I may have one more spot, depending, but I'm still considering what I'll do with the newbies I have on my hands now.

Welcome aboard, and if any Spurians wish to comment/congratulate them politely and maturely on this, you may do so in the DFC folder. Thanks all.

Michael
Editor in Chief, DFC

For Slide.

============================================================================ 
Greetings!

First off, thanks for picking up a copy of this month's DFC!  Second,  I'd like to take this time to say that I'm thrilled with my new position as Assistant Editor.  Special thanks to Michael, the head honcho Editor-type guy, for giving me a chance at this stuff, and keeping me sane (well, as sane as I get) while this issue is put together.  I foresee a lot of good things happening in the issues and days to come, and I'm glad I can be a part of it.

On a sadder note, it is with a heavy heart that I announce the dedication of this issue to Slide the Leuian, who has recently passed away.  Slide was a friend and role-model to many, and a helper to all who needed it.  His presence in these realms, and in others, shall be sorely missed.

We've got a great issue lined up for you all this month, so I suggest you dive right in, and remember to keep the material coming.  After all, you're the ones who make the DFC, and the Spur, what they are.

Love and laughter to you all,
-Marigold

::Kyrinne flies into Town Square late one evening and delicately alights on the ground before you.  She hugs you gently and smiles fondly at everyone::

I have a story you might like to hear.  It's about one who lost his way, one who denied his true self, one who angered his god.  So, sit down and make yourself comfortable while I spin my tale.  It is not a work of fiction, for I was a witness to the tragedy it recounts.  It is my love for my brethren that inspired me to make copious notes during that tragic event, and that motivates me to share it with you now.  It is a tale of sadness, a story of despair, a historical account that serves as a warning to all us.  Tell your children, tell your friends, tell those you love the most, that it is folly to anger the gods.

::Kyrinne sits down upon an intricately carved wooden bench, sighs sadly, unrolls a long illuminated scroll, and begins her tale::

One early evening Frason, a Secian heart cleric friend of mine, invited me along for a trip to the haunted house with Torien, his draggie.  Well, with my nose so assaulted by the smell of stale alcohol and sour vomit from the staggering drunks in Town Square, I jumped at the opportunity.  Anything was better than the debauchery in Town Square!  Although the weather was poor as usual, the rain pattering the road and making a muddy mess of it and darkened clouds shrouding all with a hazy gray fog, we soon arrived at the abandoned house.  Through the heavy gloom, I could feel the house peer at me with its many broken windows, its soulless ebony eyes.  I considered leaving for a moment, but only for a moment.  After all, I'm a devoted Secian heart cleric.  How could I let Torien and Frason face death without me?  Quickly and carefully, we slipped inside, unnoticed by the minions of the undead.  Not a sound did I hear, not a whisper, not a cry, not a scraping of a branch against a window.  The desolate house seemed possessed by an icy and utterly empty quiet that chilled my soul.

As Torien led us deeper into the very center of the house, the corners of dark rooms danced and shifted into ghoulish shapes that pulsated in the flickering light of my flaming stone.  As we cautiously moved from room to room, through winding hallways and secret passages, I sometimes thought I heard a strange lilting melody, a peculiar piece with a haunting refrain that sent shivers running up and down my spine.  I swallowed my fear and didn't say a word.  I hugged Frason and Torien a lot, just so I wouldn't be so scared, but I doubt if they realized I was doing it more out of fear than affection.

Suddenly we heard a voice on the wind calling "Varchild..." and we could see...things...slithering about in the shadows—unspeakable things that smelled of death and corruption, reeked of rotting flesh and putrefying carrion, and suggested disgusting practices and obscene rituals.  I shuddered while Frason tried to make sense out of what was happening.

"Um, that's either the Lone Secian or the Voice of Arioch, if I know my winds like I pray I do," Frason surmised as he pondered the possibilities.

Again a voice called out, "Varchild."  We could hear scraping off in the distance, but could see nothing but shadows dancing in the corners of the room, pirouetting and prancing in a macabre mockery of our confusion.

"Varchild...," the chilling voice called again.

I shuddered at the very sound of the voice, for it was filled with anger greater than I could comprehend.  Mysterious and foreboding, it rang out across Spur like a cold and bitter wind, a gale storm of rage, a tempest of fury.  Deeper than the deepest bass drum, it resonated so low I thought the ground trembled beneath my feet.  While Frason and I tried to understand what was happening, what wretched fate awaited Varchild, a veritable army of spirits suddenly sprang from the silent shadows.  Torien quickly sheltered us from harm, effortlessly swinging his massive quartz scimitar at the sinister spirits and efficiently banishing them to the dust from whence they came.  One by one, the spirits fell before him, one by one their ghastly remains lay at his feet, and one by one they crumbled to dust.  Out of the following and seemingly endless silence, the icy voice called out again, but this time we heard the dreadful words "I hunger" followed by an angry howl that brought my hands up to cover my ears.

"Hhhoooowwwrrrlll...," the angry voice screamed out across all of Spur.

"BRING HE WHO ANGERS," the voice demanded coldly.

I shuddered for I sensed some frightful destiny awaited Varchild.  Though I knew much of Varchild's cruelty, I still ached with a deep sadness and much regret.  For though I had tried to help him so many times, I was never able to reach him, never able to show him the folly of his schemes, never able to turn him toward the path of peace.  I felt such great remorse, for somehow I thought I had failed Sa and my brethren.

"In Sa's name," Frason said as he began to understand the origin of the voice.

Frason and I looked at each other, our hearts heavy with sorrow, knowing that Varchild was surely facing an opponent he had not anticipated.  And, sadly he would face his destiny alone.  For it was well known to most Secians that Varchild denied his race, his culture, his heritage.  Full of scorn, he publicly decreed he was a feral, a rogue that wants nothing to do with Secian Society, a miscreant that longs for chaos, an outcast that revels in his corruption.  This is perhaps the greatest sorrow known to Secians, seeing one of your own deny his or her true self.  Though Monticath, Berial, Benni, Rixinon, Rosi, Frason, and so many others had tried to help him find the right path, he simply did not care as he would quite proudly explain if one asked.  I could sense Frason's temper starting to flare and feel my apprehension mount.  His mood darkened and his eyes filled with anger. "TS, now!" he yelled.

Torien quickly led us out of the decaying mansion and hurried to Town Square where my dear, sweet, poetic dragon, Depravato, had just arrived.  But, before we had a chance to say a word to each other, a shadow grabbed Blade by the throat and hurled him against the statue with blinding force.  I stared in disbelief at the corpse of Blade, the Leuian, lying warm at my feet, and then realized the shadow was the source of the voice that called Varchild to his fate.  Confused by the chaos that surrounded me, the angry crowd pushing and shoving one another, I cuddled close to Depravato and watched the dark form of the shadow hover menacingly before us.

Varchild pointed to the shadow and said, "Allias, it wants me."

"Hey.  Now that wasn't fair," Blade's ghost said to the shadow.

"Sadly I think "it" has given a choice to Varchild," Frason said.

Confused, I asked Frason quietly, "A choice?"  I wondered what he meant, but Varchild interrupted my thoughts with a request that surprised me.

"Take me to it Kyrinne," Varchild pleaded.

"You walk your path alone Varchild," I replied.

"Each shall die until he is brought to me!" the shadow warned the crowd.

"Shadow! Name the one that you seek!" Frason demanded, frustrated by the angry mob gathering in the square, bent on bring quick closure to this ugly incident, and annoyed by the evasivness of the shadow.  If the gods must dole out cruel punishments, then do it quickly, he thought.  For surely this was like a cat playing with a mouse.

Allias, Varchild's San Elf lover, held Varchild close to her as if her embrace could protect him from the inevitable hands of fate.  Her eyes filled with tears, for she feared his life was lost and their love doomed.  I prayed to Sa to ease her pain for her sorrow was so deep.  All around me, the crowd yelled out in anger over the shadow's murder of the Leuians, Phenix and Blade, called out their denial of the shadow's greater power, and swore to have their bloody revenge.  As if their challenges for battle were insignificant, the shadow did not respond, but instead just floated there and calmly announced, "I have the power to do as I please."

"He is responsible for your pain," the shadow said, pointing at Varchild.

"Allias, I must go," Varchild said, looking at his love with resignation.

Frason sighed at the shadow and said, "You are responsible for the pain, shadow!  He is just a part of it.  Though it seems that now there is a choice for the one you seek to make."

"Why is the shadow after Varchild?" Allias cried.

"Come get me!  I no longer fear you!" Varchild yelled defiantly at the shadow.
"Allias, it is a very long story," Frason explained softy, for he too noticed her tears.

"Ask Varchild," I suggested for only he and the gods knew the whole truth.

By this time the crowd was taunting and teasing the shadow, poking and threatening the ominous dark-hooded figure.  I wondered if they knew who they were harassing.  Were all these people godless?  If not, were their gods so tolerant as to ignore insults?  I love Sa, but I respect his power.  I understood the crowd's anger, but not their actions. 

"I politely ask him to step out of peacebond, and he grabs and kills me," Blade grumbled loudly.

Slowly, the shadow turned its head toward Frason, and I saw what might have been a smile, but I couldn't tell for sure.  The hood he wore framed a fathomless pit of darkness that shifted eerily, making it impossible to see his features clearly.
"And I don't totally condemn the shadow, though its methods are something that leave much to be desired," Frason continued, glancing at the shadow as if challenging it to make its next move.

"Frason, I come because his soul called," the shadow explained, pointing at Varchild who then suddenly walked north in the direction of the guild district.

The crowd grew larger and argued amongst itself, debating the fairness of a punishment dealt by the shadow, for few of them understood the shadow was a servant of the gods.  I feared what they might do next, but I also wondered why Varchild had left Town Square.  

"Aye shadow.  And he is north of here waiting for you," Torien said, raising his eyebrow at the shadow.

"What did he do?" Allias cried out.

"Why da shadow want me?" Varchild yelled from somewhere in the distance.  "Shadow come north!"

"The shadow is something that has been coming for awhile.  I just wish it would take a less blood thirsty course," Frason sighed wearily.

Varchild entered Town Square and glanced at the shadow.  "Make me a San Elf," he demanded.  He then paused a moment and asked meekly, "What yous want shadow?"
"I want your soul," the shadow replied, its booming voice striking us like an icy wind.

"Do you not admit you've angered the gods beyond return?" the shadow asked coldly, peering at Varchild who began to tremble in fear.

"Yes," Varchild replied.  "I have."

Again the crowd attacked the shadow, Tatsumaki, a Leuian, kicking it, Blade pouncing on it, and Merial, an Arachnian, kicking it in a place I don't care to mention.  Merial howled loudly and defiantly at the dark shadow, but the shadow ignored their feeble attempts to thwart its loathsome task.  I cuddled close to Depravato, fearing what the enraged crowd might do next.  I knew in my heart that the gods sent the shadow to punish Varchild, for most Dragons and Secians alike were no stranger to the trouble that plagued him, a Secian who had stumbled on the wrong path, one filled with violence and deceit.

"I come as a result of your darkness," the shadow coldly explained to Varchild.

"Make me my true form then," Varchild demanded, still not tempered by the hopelessness of the situation.

"You people know not what you have in your midst," the shadow explained to the angry mob that was trying to defend Varchild.  "I am not the evil one."

"Many are dark, shadow.  Why do you seek this one?" Varchild asked, obviously bewildered by his predicament.

"Then make me a San Elf," Varchild demanded once again as he poked the shadow.
"Die die die!" Merial screamed at Varchild.

"What has this Secian done?" Panthera asked, for she is a Leuian with a fondness in her heart for all Secians.

"Nothing," Allias replied, obviously lost in despair.

"It's ugly and annoying," Merial signed, howling with laughter.

Frason sighed wearily and shook his head from side to side.  Frustrated by the insensitivity of the milling crowd, he felt such despair, for this was a terrible event, one of great sadness, and too few seemed to grasp the enormity of the situation.  Too few understood the depth of the evil and hideous abyss into which Varchild had willingly descended, and too few understood the pain he had caused those that loved him as kin.  For to our incredible shock and dismay he had announced his hatred for dragon-kind.  This was utterly inconceivable, an offense to nature, an insult to the gods, an affront to his race.

"This Secian is dangerous," Aiana, a Leuian, said simply.

"That is no Secian," Torien grunted.

"What has this chaos with wings done?" the shadow asked the crowd.

"He's a freak," Merial signed, his insane laugher echoing through the Square.
"I too am a "freak" then," Panthera replied.

"Strong words...where strong are needed," Frason said firmly.

"He has recently had his resurrection abilities revoked...correct?" Morriz, a Leuian asked, wondering what in Spur Varchild must have done to deserve such a penalty.

"Let the stupid shadow eat the stupid Secian.  Then let it go," Merial signed as he snickered.

"His God is displeased with him," Morriz said observantly.

"I want to be a San Elf," Varchild begged.

"That is his choice," Panthera said while Varchild stared at the shadow.

"No it isn't," Merial signed in spite of Panthera's angry growling.

"The damned do not get a choice," the shadow replied.

"Eat the tiny fool, if he is in the wrong," Crow, a Frontacian said, obviously growing weary of the wait.  Aiana beamed at the suggestion and Merial signed, "Exactly."

"Then take me now," Varchild said.

"Well why not?" Allias said, hoping to convince the shadow to be merciful.

"Everyone has a choice," Panthera said, obviously not willing to give up.

"It's actually not his choice.  He is what he is," Crobin rebutted.

"Allias, go," Varchild said, not wanting her to witness his god's revenge.

Frason growing very weary of the endless debate explained, "Varchild attacks.  Kills without provocation.  Changes wives and weds without regret, and harasses friends and Secians alike.  Sadly Varchild must now, friends, walk the road he paved for himself."  Though I had not known Frason very long, I admired his courage to speak the truth, and to explain the reason for the shame felt by so many.  I was especially proud that his voice, a Secian's voice, was the voice of reason in such an unruly crowd.

"Frason speaks the truth," I added, giving him my support.  For, I knew too well the treachery of Varchild.

"I never attack without provocation," Varchild said, vainly trying to excuse his wicked behavior that constantly threatened the future and unity of all Secians in Spur.

"Even now, the gods show their displeasure," the shadow announced to the crowd.

"But who are any to judge him?" Panthera asked.  "So to some he is Chaos.  To other, friend."

"His kin has judged him, not that he has kin left, since he disavowed himself from the Secian race," Frason explained to Panthera.

"So must he," Panthera faltered.  She paused a moment and said.  "He has chosen his path.  Let him walk it."

"Let the shadow gnaw it for a bit," Merial signed as he smiled wickedly.

"The young sometimes are haughty, but with age comes wisdom.  He may change," Morriz said hopefully.

The shadow pondered for a moment and Varchild glanced at it, for he too must have been anxious for this terrible night to become the past.  I could feel the crowd's anger rising like a misty fog with creeping tendrils that brushed against me, tentacles of fear and hatred that threatened to pull all of us closer to some dark and barren place, a desolate domain where our gods don't exist.  For I knew in my heart that the shadow was a messenger, an agent of the gods.  Who were we to judge our gods' wisdom?  I cleared my throat and said loudly, "Varchild is blinded by his thirst for glory.  He has dishonored his race and his god.  Let the fates decide his course."

"Shadow I ask this," Panthera said.  "Allow him to live.  I will watch over him and help him.  Is this acceptable?"

"Take me then shadow," Varchild said.  "Willingly and without resistance."

I understood the kindness that drove Panthera, so I said, "Panthera, your heart is in the right place, but there are things you do not understand.  You must trust the gods."

 "I don't see a god.  I see a shadow," Panthera responded.

"Are not gods responsible for all things?" I asked, wondering why everyone seemed to deny the power of the gods.  

Are other gods less powerful than mine?    

"Make me one of her race," Varchild said, pointing at Allias.

"Every race and religion has its black members," Panthera replied angrily.

"Shadow! Speak of which you have chosen.  This is hurting us all by being drawn out, and is taking more time than it should," Frason said, his brow furrowed in frustration.

"Not Secians Panthera, not like this," I cried softly, knowing that it was futile to help those who refuse your help.

Merial nodded in agreement.

The shadow pointed at Varchild and suddenly, to everyone's horror, his body began to twitch violently.  The crowd shuddered and shrieked as Varchild thrashed about on the ground, his pain obvious to anyone who watched.  I heard Frason gulp as Varchild's body become harsh to even look upon.  I could barely watch the hideous scene, for I shuddered so at the sight of this horrible transmutation.  I heard Bigflower, a Secian I knew, sniffle quietly as Varchild was enveloped in a fine mist.  Allias cried out in grief as the shadowy mist dissipated and revealed a disgusting little creature, drooling slobber from its jagged teeth.  There, in the middle of Town Square we saw before us, standing slowly, Varchild the Goblin-al.  Varchild mumbled something beneath his breath and Merial signed, "Oh man.  That's rich!"

"This is not my race," Varchild said angrily.

"Such a mean and impolite shadow," Blade snickered.

This is how the great gods solve their problems.  By creating yet another," Morriz complained.

"Tonight," Varchild warned, his voice cold and calculating, in a way I knew all too well.  I pondered what he meant, for both Frason and I knew he blamed me for his destiny, perhaps more than he blamed other Secians.

"Sadly I must say, though, that his fate he chose for himself," Frason explained wearily.

"Yes, is very sad.  Many tried to help him," I agreed quietly.

"We all tried to help him to the end, but now," Frason said sadly.

"No gods will have him," The shadow said.  "I am merely the hand of delivery."

The crowd milled about in anger, furiously complaining about the deaths of Phenix and the others, and fondly rubbing and waving their finely crafted weapons.  The shadow warned, "I shall not allow you to attack me.  Phenix, it was because of my tie to "He Who Angers" that that your death was necessary."

"Varchild was dishonoring his Lord Mistress Elindale," signed Merial. "He was dishonoring his race and his Goddess."

"You did nothing.  ‘He Who Angers' caused your death," the shadow explained to those that had died.

"I don't even know ‘He Who Angers.'  I just got mad at you for killing Phenix," Blade said, sighing in resignation.

"I am a thing created by the Mind of Varchild,"  The shadow explained so all would understand.  At this moment Zuberi, a dragon, walked into the Town Square, looked at the Goblin-al, and asked in disbelief, "That is Varchild?"

"Varchild's creation?" Phenix pondered.

"Talk about a messed up little guy," Merial said in the language of clerics.

"The Goblin-al," Depravato said sadly, for no dragon would feel joy for the events of this night.

"My work is done and no longer are he and I bound.  He now is his own shadow," The shadow said to the crowd.

::Kyrinne sips some fresh spring water and clears her tired throat, for the tale was so long in telling.  She smiles kindly and continues with the conclusion::

Well, this sad story doesn't really end.  For the gods in their wisdom soon changed Varchild into the San Elf he so desired.  Without the protection of Depravato, Zuberi, Rollie, and many others, I would have died that very night at the hands of Varchild, the San Elf, and OmegaDevil, the rogue Dragon.  Sadly, "He Who Angers" learned little from the servant of the gods, and to this day blames his kin for his dismal fate.  

To add to the confusion of that terrible evening, Merial decided to make the shadow his familiar.  But that is another tale for another time.  Suffice it to say the gods became even angrier than before and sent a wind fairy to tell us they were considering removing their altars from Spur.  Angry black-robed archpriests marched into Town Square that sad night and killed many innocents and infidels alike, but few Spurians seemed to understand why for within two days several holy avatars were killed.  What will Spur be like without our gods?  What will we do if they leave?

As for Varchild, it is a mystery to many of us how he soon reappeared as a Secian, his heart blackened by hate and bent on revenge, his tongue speaking of violence once again, and his hands forever stained by the blood of his victims.  Sometimes I fear he may be a servant of the Lords of Chaos, for chaos is what he brings to Spur.  So, take heed citizens of Spur.  Respect your gods and serve them well, for even worse than the fate of "He Who Angers" is the future of a Spur without our gods.

::Kyrinne rolls up her gilded scroll and ties it with a ruby silk ribbon.  She hugs you gently, wishes everyone a restful sleep, and gracefully takes to the skies, eager to find her dear Dragon, Depravato::

============================================================================
An incredibly diminutive purple robed Secian Rune Master steps from a small altar in the corner of the room and genuflects before it, bowing his head deeply, the long, shaggy blond hair falling slowly before his face in curly locks.  He rises slowly, as though still deep in prayer, mumbling softly to himself, still bowing his head slowly, but brushing up at the platinum curls around his forehead.  Looking up finally, he settles himself down in a small floating chair before a minuscule desk and pulls a tome as large as himself nearer to him with a small twist of the hand.  The tome is bound in an odd, obviously magickally dyed purple flesh-like material, stretched taut against the steelwood backings.  The tiny Master giggles at the book and starts to stroke and caress it, giggling all the louder while hugging it tightly too his chest, keeping it floating with a small flying carpet underneath it.  The tome settles down with a soft "THUD" onto the surface of the little floating desk.

Now, this desk was a thing of wonder.   It was smaller than the already tiny Rune Mage, and yet held more information and power on it's top than even the Great Frontacian Libraries of old could claim.  As anything inanimate touched it's polished amethyst top, it shrank to the size of this tiny man's smallest finger-nail.  This allowed the Mage to store over one thousand books in the space ten would've taken up.  A very wise mage is our little friend.

The mage opens up the now huge book slowly, and a dark light begins to spew from the book's pages, reflecting off the cherubic mage's face.  His eyes start to glaze over as he absorbs the knowledge in this dark book, his fingertips often finding a small rune of chaos on his right forearm and caressing it.

Now, I'm sure you are curious about who this wise little Master of Runes is, and I'm sure you know him, also.  He is Traph Graznrap, widely known as "Traphie".  Now, many will question why this little fellow, a being of pure innocence would be reading such trying material as a book of Magick stolen during the Minor Raids on Frontacia by the Psycian race, during the Great Wars, a book once belonging to the High Mage of Taath.

Traph is a rare Secian, one who is bound up by Order.  His mind travels to new ideas and changes, but always helping, never does an angry or mean thought enter this angel's mind.  Yet.

Traph closes the book slowly and settles it back into it's miniature form in it's place on the amethyst desktop with a tired gesture of his fingertips, trailing them along until they point at his large beeswax candle and a tiny gush of water squelches the flame before the gesticulation is through.  Fluttering slowly down from the chair, he steps foot in front of tired little foot, and soon is in bed, closing his eyes to welcome a much needed sleep.  He had memorized and almost attempted two entire new spells, governed by Chaos, this long day.  As he closed his eyes he realized he hadn't prayed to his Lord Master SA before sleeping and slowly rolls himself out of bed and lands softly, and plods foot before exhausted foot to his decimated  prie-deux.  Kneeling slowly, tiredly, he bows his head in solemnly devoted worship to SA, muttering softly the prayers beneath his breath.  

Blearily looking up from his prayers, Traph stood slowly and turned.  Blinking slowly, Traph gazes upward, staring, and falls to his knees and lays himself prone on the ground before a mighty blue dragon.  The dragons chuckles softly to itself, breathing small puffs of smoke out it's nostrils and lightly touches one huge claw gently to Traph's shoulder and rumbles, "Arise, my tiny Servant."  Traph slowly looks up into the dragon's eyes, and starts to giggle.  Through the giggle Traph trinkle's out like a tiny bell, "Hihi SA-Draggie!" and hugs the huge form tightly about the ankle, forcing another smoky chuckle from the Dragon-God.

The mighty blue Dragon slowly picked up Traph and set him on the bedside, and sat himself down on a large space on the floor.  Looking sternly at the little Master Mage, the Dragon-God touched his large claw to the space above Traph's heart.  "In there," the Dragon rumbled, "Is something very special in your kind.  There is Chaos.  Change.  But also therein lies something very common to my Secians.  Kindness."  Traph listened to his Lord Master SA with awe, comprehending swiftly that his prayers were being answered... he would be given power over the runes of Chaos as he had prayed for literally religiously every day at morning chapel and Vespers, and before he laid himself to rest.

Reading Traph's thoughts, the Mighty Dragon gave a smoky laugh, merrily, feeling the happiness from Traph and beginning to embody it.  Making a small pulling motion above Traph's heart he said, "Here is the thread, invisible to you, of your soul that keeps you within the power of Order and unable to use the Runes of Chaos.  Give the word, and I will allow you to start the long, harsh journey that will, irrevocably, change you forever."

Traph looked puzzled for a moment and pondered the choices.  He could either choose to live a life of Entropy or Chaos and be shunned away by his kin, while gaining more power than he ever had, or he could remain Orderly and give up the dreams of that power.  Quickly he giggled, "Pull dat thread!" to his Dragon-God.  Nodding slowly, SA pulled his hand away, and Traph could see and feel a bright white thread leaving his chest.  The dragon blow fiery breath along the length of the thread, and it charred, leaving a dark, dirty thread in it's stead.  SA gave the thread to Traph, and said, "Make the final addition of Chaos to your own Soul Traph," and smiled.  Traph looked down puzzled at the thread and a thought entered his mind, "Undo what was done."  Giggling, he touched the nearly invisible black thread to the skin above his heart.  The dark thread glowed, and swiftly entered his body, forcing a shuddering gasp from his chest.  He looked up and the Dragon said, "Traph, my dear son, you shall attain ultimate power for this, and glorify My name and the Power of Runemagick."

Traph asked the God-Dragon if he was Chaotic yet, through a ponderous giggle, and the Dragon slowly shook His head from side to side.  "No my son," he said gravely.  "That must you do...for yourself.  You have the power to devoid your soul of all Order.  Merely invoke the proper Runes... and it shall be done."

Wondering what the runes could be for some time, Traph looked up, and realized his Master SA-Dragon was gone, but he heard a soft rumble in his mind, "No, my Son.  I am always... here.  Remember that you are trying to Destroy a part of your Being."  Giggling loudly, Traph sat and meditated upon a spell, remembering it from his vast mental storehouse, and started to cast a very, powerful spell.  The dark black web hit him, and started to pull his body apart.  He could feel something inside of himself give way and start to dissipate.  The spell ended just as his life's blood started to fade.

Waking from a long unconsciousness, Traph realized he was in the Other Realm, in spirit form.  SA appeared again before him, and asked, "Traph, my student, you have done well.  You are as now, the only Secian who has the choice to become a vessel of Chaos.  Before you choose, let me show you this... how your life would be with Chaos in it."

The dragon touched Traph and his body started to convulse, Traph threw his hands up and started shrieking.  SA let go of the little Mage saying, "That is what your mind would sound like, exposed to Chaos."  Traph slowly blinked, and realized that to become Chaotic would surely kill him.  He could barely stand the brief split-second that he had been shown.  Traph shook his head slowly at the Dragon and whispered, "SA-Draggie, peez.. give mes back the limited powers of Entropies. Mes will work mes hardes' to glorifies yous name an' mes Guild with what powers mes'll have wif Entropies."

Chuckling softly, SA touched Traph on the forehead, and Traph fell slowly, standing up in the Altar room of the Mighty SA, Lord of Magick and Mages, whose symbol is the dragon, intricately carved into every holy vessel and deitic symbol in the Temple.   Traph slid into his purple robes, and touched his arm to the small rune of Chaos on his left forearm.  Calling the powers of Translocation, he sent himself swiftly to the Mage's Guild.  Entering the store he asked to have two new Magickal Runes implanted into his body.  Order and Entropy.

The mage Traph is living, learning to balance the Chaos, Entropy and Order of his self and trying to stay as wholly pure of heart as he had been before.  His power grows nearly daily and he learns much as often.  The Great Dragon did Traph a great favor, and made him the first Secian of his Generation to gain power over the Runemagick of Chaos.

Well, as you've probably heard, the Bardic Recitals are back.

Can't say they're improved much, since we're still missing our favorite Mistress of Ceremonies, Allandra. Let's all hope for her swift and safe return!

I thought this would be the right place to announce a few changes I'm making, at least until I get through all this paperwork that's been piling up. ^_^*

Instead of just a list of winners and a seperate list of the winning entries, problems with my autoscribe make it much easier to just post the log, (Two of them in this DFC, I believe..) condensed a bit. I thought this would be more friendly to those who couldn't make it.

Also, I'll probably delay the championships until two weeks from now, as I haven't been able to keep a very good record of some of the past recitals.

Also, some announcements.. If anybody sees my autoscribe drunk in the tavern, tell him to get over to my office, NOW. ^_^*

And a notice to Allandra.. I get to keep half of the stage when you get back. ^_-

Until next month!

When I came to Spur, about 8 and a half months ago, the world seemed new and strange to me.  Why did I keep getting killed?  Why did everything do so much damage. Why didn't anyone laugh at my jokes?  I learned things. I found out that: I was weak, Leather sucks hairy poodle, and I wasn't funny. I learned I couldn't hit khats, and that attacking Sordum was just plain foolish.  I grew, with Spur, and through Spur.  But now, things seem different. Some of the greats that I followed and respected are gone: Skylar, Chel, Moten, Atog, GoldenJaw, and now Slide and Jazbo. ( Jaz just told me he wouldn't be around much anymore).  It shows us how precious life really is, and how we must cherish every moment we have.  All of these people were and are my friends, but now that they aren't here, I find myself missing them, wishing I had spent more time with them.  Things change, people grow and become different, strange.  But it is unfortunate when some don't get a chance to grow, evolve, their threads cut short before their time.  Perhaps the world would be a better place if we took time to honor our friends while they are with us, and not after they are gone...
Whether or not they read this, may the families of the players of Slide and GoldenJaw get through their hard times, knowing they have countless friends, beyond the Gate

SSFLS Bi-Annual Report.

Hello, this is Aubrei RHRashakae, vice president of the Save the Spotted Forum Leader Society (SSFLS). Due to the work of Chelestra, Marigold and Myself, we have been able to save one very important forum leader, of the rare, special and eccentric Jimbo species. I think we should all take a moment to study how important Jimbo is to our beloved forum.  He works maybe half of his day keeping us in line, spending the other half sleeping and foraging for Nuke berries, the main part of his diet.  He does all in his power to be fair and unbiased, keeping all of us from doing something we would most likely regret, like calling him Jimbo to his face.  He has to put up with ferals, Chelestra, and having to decide where the thin line between Role Playing and Personal Attacks is drawn. I think next time we want to hurt him because of something he nuked, we should consider all that he does for our benefit.  Thank you, and with your continued support, we will save all of the Forum Leaders, spotted or not.

Twas a happy, sunny day, and I was tramping through the Rogue Fields, attempting to use my new Jeweled Naginta against something other than a rock. No, I don't know what a naginta is, some kind of pole I guess...  Anyways, I was hopping pleasantly along, when my head started pounding. At first I was worried it was another bad idea, but then I discovered it was Commissioner Shortly contacting me. I went quickly to H. Q., but when I reached it's normal spot I found nothing but a sign. It read:
Due to the attempted engraving of this headquarters, it has disappeared. Please go into thehole to your left.  

After going through the hole, hitting my head three times, twice on the ceiling, one onsome rat droppings, I reached the familiar shadow I knew as the Commissioner.  "Hello" she said, "Want a mint"? I wondered if this was a suggestion, a request, or a plea.  "Plea" she responded, reading my thoughts again " Here, take 30"  " Sd" I asked, through a mint filled mouth " aepi so fmw lrkj fo sow?" Coughing and Sputtering, I put the mints in my left ear, where I would remember them. Repeating myself " So, what can I do for you?" She said in a grave voice " We have a problem, some of Spur's greatest refuse to smile.  It is your duty to go and create happiness in their tired bodies" "But how" I asked "I'm just one person, and how to make Spur laugh?"  "Just be yourself" she said, and disappeared into the deeper shadows.  Following her, I noticed a small Secian in the corner, covering her eyes with her left hand. She kept muttering " If I can't see you, you can't see me... If I can't see you..."  I left her there, knowing she would be ok.  I set off, glancing at my list
list to get my first target, Jazbo.  How to get the great Monit angry, I wondered. Then a small,dim torch went up in flames over my head. An idea, most likely, I thought.  

	After finding Jazbo, I preceded to pound him senseless. My feeble attempts to
cause him harm made him begin to laugh uncontrollably. With this method I took care of Michael, Kbar, Bizzy, and my archnemisis, Araton.  Feeling unfulfilled, I wandered back into the Rogue fields, where my adventure had begun.  I was feeling rather tired, and rather bored.  I decided to sleep. That didn't help, so I slept some more. After 3 months, I was just as bored, though really awake.  What could I do? What would be the largest and best joke ever?  I thought back to my long days on the boat, yawning the Technicolor yawn over the edge, speckling the sea with vomit.  I thought of the ArchDemon, the one that had so toyed with my emotions and my time.

	I had it, I had my mission, my hope for revenge: I was going to pants the
ArchDemon.  A few problems came up in my head.

1.  He's the ArchDemon, meaning he's bigger, meaner, and uglier than Jazbo. Well,
maybe just bigger and meaner.

2.  He may or may not wear pants.  After all, most of us don't, for various reasons.
I got around the first problem by blindfolding myself, figuring not only would I be
invisible, but that I wouldn't be scared of him because I couldn't see him. The second was easier, I got a pair of pants, ready to put them on him right before I took them off.  I headed out towards where he had last been seen, blindfold on, holding the pants out in front of me. At the beginning I flew, but 3 trees later, I decided to walk.  I kept meeting people, pantsing them, and getting hit. After all, I couldn't see anything, and sometimes there weren't pants where I was grabbing. That was bad.  I finally gave up when I pantsed a demon, thinking close enough.  I then traveled all over Spur, begging people for returning throw weapons. I got nothing, except for the shaft, but I already had one, so I gave it back to Guz.  I was worried, because I wasn't really happy. To many things had changed, too many people had left.  I looked into the Sun, squared my shoulders, and rubbed my Golden medallion of Unknown, prepared to bother people in their minds, where they couldn't ignore me.  

Agents of S.A.N. don't forget. We remember the good, the bad, the friends, the enemies, those that are still here, those that we miss.  We have fun, but do it in the memory of those that should still be with us, sharing that fun.  May your smiles be full, and your memories clear as crystal.

============================================================================
On the 5th day of the 10th month of the year 304, hundreds of Spurians hastened to the rainbow silk Rehas tent in the East Hedgelands (a.k.a. the rogue fields) with pouches full of gold and silver for Sordum the Psycian Merchant. For the first item, Sordum pulled out an exquisite ancient gold harp, a beautiful instrument that may have or not have been unbreakable (Sordum either didn't know or didn't want to tell us). Armonius the Hithual bid a nice round 320k and took it home that night. The second item to be bidded for was a nice max, 1.5 hander sharp weapon, a gleaming crystalla sword of penance. After many drooling fighters and such bidded with their seemingly endless supplies of gold, Lukedog the Thugian finally received the great sword for a nice 800k. Next out of Sordum's chest, a nice light armor, especially for Secians, Psycians, hand clerics and others slight of build, a silver trimmed white silk robes. Unfortunately for the poor, the price quickly shot up to a couple hundred thousand silver and was finally won by Slepinfire the 2nd Stage Dragon for 600k. Promptly, he gave the robes to the Secian Starlyn which she eagerly tried on. The 4th item showed off was a nice helm which supposedly made head shots feel like a pinch, a nice shimmering emerald large helm. Surprisingly or not, the bids shot up and Creolis finally won it for 640k. Next, Sordum pulled out a green jade fighter's main gauche, a very nice shield which did cast armor aura at first, but was modified to bark wall. The bids racked up and stopped at 675k which won Kagee the gauche. The 5th item for bids was a fiery red magma mail, weighing in at 200 lbs. and debatable if it was max Rehas. Armonius quickly threw his bids in and won his second item for the night for a whopping 1.5 million silver. Next, a golden ivory flask was pulled out, advertised to be able to find people hiding easier and easier see if someone is picking you, if you haven't figured it out yet, it's a perception potion. Surprisingly, even though it only had one dose, Vagn bid 370k and won the flask. And the last item, the most wanted item for the night was an unbreakable, 1.5 max Rehas sharp with a translocation aura on it, a very nice opal rune-encrusted blade. Bids flew back and forth and that great runie Frontacian Guaire snagged it for a nice 1.51 million silver. Congratulations to all those who won things at the peddle and just imagine Sordum grinning with his pouches weighed down with all that gold.

Okay little ones, gather around and your Uncle Feste (Festeling as Kyrsten calls me, or Uncle Feste as Livie does) shall tell you a story about the limits and expectations of a Secian. The Story begins:

It was a day like every other in the middle of Town Square Central in the Spur, rain drops pitty-pattered on the arch above my head as I stared off into the blankness of the night before me. Tonight wasn't very active, seemed like no one was getting hurt, no people stumbling and falling down unconscious, no corpses being dragged in to resurrect and surprisingly, no one needing vigor! As I sat leaning on my war dog, fur bristling against my neck, I tapped my fingers on the floor irritably waiting for something to happen. Gazing off into the blurry stars, hazy from the mist of the rain drops, my war dog made a slow yawn and drooled a puddle of coagulated slobber onto the ground. From far off in the distance to the south, I heard a faint scream and a thudding noise. Leaping to my feet, I whistled a command to my war dog and spectre and struck a piece of flint, igniting a spark onto the gleaming oil in my lantern. Immediately, flames shot up inside and a glow emanated, illuminating the whole room as I closed a glass door on the lantern so the wind wouldn't blow it out. Hastily, I ran south about 20 paces and saw a limp form on the  round, raindrops pounding and exploding on the small body and wings. I ran over to the body, sliding on the ground the last few feet next to the hunched form. As I placed my hand on the shoulder of the person and placed the victim onto it's back, I looked into it's face and saw one of the most encaptivating and beautiful Secians in all of Spur, the fair maiden Goewyn.

Gasping, a soft moaning sound escaped the lips of the unconscious body of the small form. Gently, I leaned over the form of my wife, placing my hands upon her chest and closing my eyes whispered a short prayer to the god Sa. In a few seconds, a blue cloud hovered above in the sky and slowly, the power of Sa permeated my tiny frame. Slightly painfully and with a little work, I channeled the healing powers of the all powerful god of magick, Sa through my finger tips into the body of my beloved. Eventually, those deep, exquisite ruby eyes opened and a beautiful light took on her face.

I then asked, "What happened love?"

She then proceeded to tell a story and I sat down and listened intently. Accordingly, the story went like this: "I was walking back to TS after traveling from Thiarin'a's lair earlier that day and was slightly fatigued and decided to take a break for a snack. While nibbling on a cracker, a dart flew from the shadows and I was hit by a puff of sand. Suddenly, fatigue conquered me, my hand dropped and the cracker fell to the floor, as did I and was rendered unconscious. While unconscious, I could still feel his grimy hands searching through my pouch and looking for something. He seems to have taken nothing though."

Anger brimmed up and I felt like extracting my revenge on whomever had done this to my wife. But as the hatred boiled, my Secian body couldn't take it and I passed out from the overdose of anger. A few minutes later, I finally came to, light headed still as the anger was (and is) too much for a Secian's body to hold.

The moral to the story is that Secians are natural helpers to their community, and play a very active roll in that of Spur. Also, we being Secians, just can't handle anger like everyone else, our bodies just aren't capable of it. And you, as the future generation of Spur of Secians must teach these lessons to your children and your children must to your children's children. These teachings are the basis of a Secian's attitude.

============================================================================
(Writer's Note- This is a little piece of fiction that I created as a mock report for a certain Science teacher friend of mine. [though been a long time since I've had classes with her] It may or may not reflect how IWP, the Elders, Sa, Moe the Janitor, and all the other important people actually is using the race. Anyone who tries to do wacky Role Playing of a Secian and blames it on this piece of fiction shall be mercilessly whacked with the Role Playing Stick by myself.)

A Biological Report, The Secian:

A Secian is a sentient humanoid being, typical arms, legs, hands, feet, and head configuration. Wings with the approx style of a butterfly's support flight to up to 1,275 feet AGL (Above Ground Level). Natural hair pigmentation is always blonde, and eyes are inherently ruby colored. (This is thought to be because there is no other colored eyes in the gene pool, not any racial limitation of it.)

Despite having a muscle to fat volume compatible with a Human's, the small stance at 1'3" typically, with the 'giants' of the race reaching 1'6", makes both them and
there ability to carry weight very small. A Secian in his prime that has ate his Reduxa (a special herb that causes a massive amount of fat gain) will typically
be 90lbs. A non-Reduxaed Secian in his prime will be in the mid 20lb to 30lb range.

Secians are typically non-violent due to a anomaly coined the 'Empathic Quark'. All Secians are born with a natural empathy, which is rumored to be remnants to
a possible Frontacian decendancey at the time of the UnMagick, that creates a Physical need NOT to kill or hurt. This Physical need has manifested itself so well 
in the years that an type of 'Empathic Spillage' has occurred into the psychological part of an Secian's thought spectrum. Effectively barring any thought of 
killing or hurting sentient alive life forums. (Though many a Secian do choose to hunt Undead, this seems to have no social stigma attached.) 

Some Secians are born with a rare deformity in there brains wherein the Empathic Spillage does not occur. Note that the Empathic Quark is still very much active, 
and there is a a physical need to not kill/hurt, which will arrive in the forum of an Empathic Backlash. However the psychological barriers that even stopped 
the thought of killing are gone, so most of this deformity choose more violent of professions.

An even rarer case is that both the Empathic Spillage (Herein known as ES) and the Empathic Quark (Herein as EQ) are both perverted in a way we can not determined.
The ES is as good as gone, however EQ results show that these types get pleasure from such Empathic Backlash. (Herein as Backlash) This tends to breed extremely 
violent Secians, almost to the point of xenophobic. (Which includes other Secians at times, since other Secians tend to shun this type of deformity.) However, the rate of birth having either deformity is quite low, so any danger posed by such is very low.


As a side note, the ES blocks the spectrum from thinking of killing. (As in the personal act of the Secian  killing something.) ES itself does not defer a Secian of
speaking about such things other people did, though part of the ES makes a strong detest to anyone whom causes death for no reason. This extends to the entire race of Muatana-Al, who's very existence requires the rape of life force from others. (See: Muatana-Al, research in, for more details.) 

The main benefit of EQ is to the Draconic world. During a Dragon's time of Staging, the EQ allows the Secian to avoid the magickal barriers surrounding such nature, and relive the Dragon in question of a indescribable amount of pain. There is also a meta-physical relation that occurs between a Secian who helps and the Dragon that 
was helped. They're physical systems are also linked as well, which details that when one dies, the other die. However the Secian, when 'bonded', shares the same life expectancy as the Dragon, which has ranged into the Multi-Millennia for some. 

In final look at the Secian, the EQ seems to have one more use, the one normally associated with Empathy: Healing. Secians seem to be natural at Healing, by the 
mind set to do so, and the many different types of ways it can be accomplished. A Secian of a Clerical Order can have six (6) different ways to heal. (Some orders teach a combatant move that transfers life from one to others, All orders can call on there god with limited drain on themselves by laying hands on there chest and praying, 
they have two different spells [Of Aura and of God Shape], direct begging of divine intervention, and there Empathy can transfer wounds.) 

This has seen many adventures for a Secian. Not for his value to slice up anything, but his ability to keep the party alive. Many people owe there lives to these brave 
peoples who can heal nearly as quick as wounds are inflicted, and that is our look at the Secian.

How to fight, with success!

MAGICK TIPS:
Tip #1: If you are fighting a very strong person, weaponwise, you should ALWAYS tact dance, That is why it is there! Being a fat dragon like myself, the only people that can't hit me, aren't very good at there weapons. 

Tip #2: Your fam is your best friend. This works for Dragons and runies.... ALWAYS use your fam, it helps alot, unless it is a raven or something, try saving up for a destrier, that extra 10 fatigue when you are too low to cast a vigor, cause you got a pulsing spell on someone, really helps, alot.

Tip #3: Get good at shield parry. You may not think mages need it, but, hey, they do! Keep your shield readied at all times, then when you cast a spell, ready a dagger after it, and just swing once, if you are good enough, your shield will block it a few times,and save you some serious pain!

Tip #4: Use pulsing spells over those one-time thingys. I mean, some people think, wow, 5 Lightning Bolts in a row does more damage then a Fire Whip, and cost the same amount of fatigue. But, a pulsing spell allows you to do other things while damaging them, all you have to do is keep yourself vigored enough. And being a Dragon, you can swipe at them a few times, with a pulsing spell.

Tip #5: Practice Practice Practice! My mentor for magick, Dravon, says this is the only way to succeed. Casting Vigor Aura's at yourself repetitively is the best way to do this. Don't' think you are gonna get those last 2000 uses using Wood Whips, it ain't gonna happen!
Just chill at the Mage's guild for awhile casting Vigor Aura's

Fighting Tips:
Tip #1:  Always look into what your opponent's background is, he might be better then you by 5 levels, and you couldn't hit him then.

Tip#2: If your opponent is wearing maxxed out Rehas mail, don't fight him with a steel saber or something. if you don't have good artillery, don't fight.

Tip#3: Use the practice target's in the TG!!!!!!!!
Don't expect to go into the graveyard, and start hacking away at a shade! You aren't gonna hit! 

Tip#4: Value skill over treasure! Without skill you are nothing, you could have 5 million in the bank, but if you are level 1, then, it doesn't make a difference. You can't buy skill uses(Or happiness!)

Tip#5: Use shield parry, this is one of the better skills in Dragon's Gate. If someone is smacking ya hard, you have a good chance, that your shield will save you from that 24 point deathblow!


Tip#6: First Aid, since most of the fighting type don't get healing spells, they need the First Aid! It saves lives!

Tip#7: Variety. Learn a variety of skills. If you are alot better then your opponent, your DR doesn't matter much! Switch to a more powerful weapon, like a blunt or Pole.

Tip#8: USE SHARPS to start out with, it is alot better for DR/OR purposes. Once you get really good, switch to Poles or Blunts or even missile, don't' try Thrown unless you have an extra million to make it returning!


General Tips:

Tip#1: Do not walk around with money on you, even though thieves are rare now, hey, they still are out there!

Tip#2: Always, put friends in front of skills or money! If you are out hunting, and your friend is getting attacked, abandon that wretch, trans up there, and start fighting for him!

Tip#3: If you are a Dragon, work on channeling more then sharps or your type of weapon, channeling is more useful for Dragons!

Tip#4: If you know that someone is bigger then you, don't be afraid to say not to fight(Usually they still kill you), it may cause you embarrassment, but hey, it is better then shelling out thousands of silvers for a rezz!

Tip#4: Suck up to older player's, they might become friends with you some day
Tip #5: I kinda ran out....::grin::

Cabbit.
Noun.
1. A cross between a cat and a rabbit.

History of the Cabbits:

	Cabbits were created in the lab of the greatest genius known, Washu. They quickly escaped and propagated, gaining an unnatural intelligence. (Rumor has it they were helped by the experiments of a rainbow-haired Flerian, who shall remain nameless.) They are said to have secretly started the war between the Arachnians and Penthanians, and turned the Taathians from a timid danish-loving tribe preaching love, peace, and the healthy advantages of meatless clerical food, into the bloodthirsty smiting children of death we know today.  

In retribution for the Taathian Tribe Turn, (TTT for short,) the Taathians decided to use Cabbits as the base for their Evil, Corrupt, Taathian Sausage.

	Those Cabbits who branched off the main evolutionary path became Meeps. Meeps will be discussed in a later article. Cabbits have been unable to gain a firm hold in the spur, due mainly to the actions of the protecting demi-gods, or Elders, who think the Cabbit a delicacy. (I need to acquire a Cabbit for study, would somebody please find one for me. Thank you.)

Cabbit Behavior:

Cabbits can be EXTREMELY touchy and impatient. If you find one, pet it and hug it, but don't attack it or I'll have to kill you. ^_^*. Cabbits are known to gather in herds, which can trample and instantly slay someone. So play nice! ^_^.

Catching your Own Cabbit.

I'll go in order.

1) Give Esper a fam collar.

2) Lead Esper to the Cabbit.

3) Wait.

Hope this has cleared up some of the questions you might have had. Please feel free to talk to me for any more complex questions.

Disclaimer: Walking up to me and saying "What should I feed my pet Cabbit?" will result in me latching onto your back and ransacking your house looking for it.

Cheers!

The Chaotic Cast

His swing came crashing down.
It hit with force, as I fell to the ground.
I needed help, to let me win.
I needed defense to begin.

I reached into the back of my mind.
I knew what I wanted to find.
Past the knowledge of mental maps I had made.
Past the knowledge of even how I wielded blade.
Past the memory of all my friends.
And lives that I shall end.

A Shiver rolled down my spine.
A Thought had popped into my mind.
A picture formed in front of me.
I looked up from the ground with glee.
As he started to swing.
I was covered with a bright gleam.
I was not harmed.
In his head, he felt alarmed.
He wanted to run.
So I decided to have more fun.

I reached into the back of my mind.
I knew what I wanted to find.
Past the knowledge of mental maps I had made.
Past the knowledge of even how I wielded blade.
Past the memory of all my friends.
And lives that I shall end.

My opponent was as good as dead.
I just had caught him in a crystal Web.
He squirmed and cried.
I looked up at him and sighed.

I reached into the back of my mind.
I knew what I wanted to find.
Past the knowledge of mental maps I had made.
Past the knowledge of even how I wielded blade.
Past the memory of all my friends.
And lives that I shall end.

The evil swelled beneath my skin.
I grinned a toothy grin.
The dark side of my body came out.
I must admit, I had a doubt.
But my magick never fails. 
Everyone could hear the dying man's wails.
The Rotting Web of decay.
Drained his life away.

I reached into the back of my mind.
I knew what I wanted to find.
Past the knowledge of mental maps I had made.
Past the knowledge of even how I wielded blade.
Past the memory of all my friends.
And lives that I shall end.

I looked down at him, crying on the ground.
But my anger, wouldn't let me hear the sound.
Not the anger against my foe.
But because evil was my final blow.
I was turning dark.
I suddenly heard an animal bark.
I turned around and let loose a spell.
The dog's heart began to swell.
His chest burst open.
As these words of mine were spoken.
"The outside is strong"
"But the inside is wrong"

Maire says, "okee..this is a combo deal...a story with a song..so bear with me"
Maire says, "This song has a bit of a story to it, "
Maire says, "So please bear with me for a bit."
Maire says, "I was travelling along the road one day"
Maire says, "when I came upon a family of Oog-ra (Mother, Father, and baby)"
Maire says, "Figuring that it would be safer to travel in a group,"
Maire says, "I joined the trio for a ways on the road."
Maire says, "We managed some talk throughout the day,"
Maire says, "and I think they enjoyed the few tunes I played as we went."
Maire says, "As the day waned we all sat by the fire to have some food."
Maire says, "After we had supped, the "little" one became rather cranky,"

Vagn pulls out a makeup kit and sets to work disguising himself as someone else.

Marigold winks.

Marigold says, "you can edit it, silly boy...besides, it'll get accepted."  (Ed. Note-OK, so I'm the one who ended up editing it.  Open mouth…insert foot in mouth…)

Armonius says, "...those I love seem to know best."
Armonius says, "...to help me keep my sanity."
Armonius smiles.


Rosi says, "So.."
Rosi says, "To be sane,"
Rosi says, "Is it such hard a task?"
Rosi says, "I am not quite sure, friend"
Rosi says, "I'm the right one to ask."
Rosi says, "For time after time, I have pondered the meaning,"
Rosi says, "I've come up with but one answer."
Rosi ponders the meaning of the universe for a moment.
Rosi says, "Cheese rolls."

Maire hugs the artfully carved balalaika.

============================================================================
A shadowy figure stood hidden against dusky rocks high above the city known as Spur. 
The young dragon was slight, but there was power concealed within his diminutive form; an aura of power and strength and hatred all mingled together emanated from him like a horrid stench, as a fish reeks after being left on the shore of the stream for too many days.  He studied the buildings below with a cool, dispassionate eye, an eye that had once been passionate and dreamy with a hint of mischief concealed behind the crimson pupil.  He picked out a figure, tiny to his distant sight, but probably well over six feet tall to one standing near, and thought for a moment.  Frontacian, he thought, and his voice grew hoarse with emotion as his whispered his fallen brother's name...

Ever since Darronogon had chipped his way out of the egg, Darsnovak had been there for him.  There was no punishment worse for him than the scrutiny of his brother's dreamy eye, no reward greater than the elder's approving smile.  In the cruel world the brothers had been thrust into devoid of parents or even other dragons, they served as eachothers' eyes and ears, watching their armorless backs against the perils of the dangerous life the hatchlings led unprotected.  Darsnovak seemed to Darronogon to have infinite wisdom far beyond his tender years, always knowing whether a fight was hopeless or a path too steep, and at night he would spin tales of the great Red Dragons who had spawned the twins and died before they ever saw their sons.  Darsnovak murmured in his quiet, gentle voice that they had probably died at such a young age, never even reaching forth stage, because they had denied their calling and turned to chaos, and chaos creates, but it also destroys what it creates.  Darsnovak praised entropy, whispering that order was safe and sturdy and unchanging, but without a dash of chaos, what reason was there for a young dragonlet to live?  And Darronogon would sleepily nod, telling himself that whatever his brother said must be true.

One bright, clear, misleadingly cheery morning after a particularly long evening tale, Darronogon awoke to find himself alone in the dreary cave the orphans called home.  Darsnovak sometimes wandered off by himself for a spell, and Darronogon could hardly blame him.  He had to admit that he was bold and rash and unthinking at times, and without his brother's clear reason he would have been dead long ago.  Looking after his brother certainly must grate on Darsnovak's nerves, though he would never admit it; he deserved time alone.  Darronogon curled up in a patch of sunlight to wait for his sibling's return.

A scream quite unlike any sound Darronogon had ever heard pierced his reverie.  He sat bolt upright, trying to identify the cry, and a moment later, had the answer.  He was off like a shot, sprinting on his two short, immature legs as fast as he could, fear giving him an extra burst of speed, bracing himself against the scene he felt certain must await him, but when he arrived, it was nothing like what he had imagined.  His brother's corpse lay in the bloodstained clearing, though it was hardly recognizable as such; the tender, thin hide had been stripped from the body, the essence drained away, and standing above the corpse with a look of obvious triumph brightening his features was a pasty-faced man with a gem glittering sickeningly in the middle of his pallid forehead.

Torn with grief and burning with rage, the wingless, puny dragon pounced on the superior RuneMage in an obviously hopeless attack; but somehow reason and logic were repelled that one time, for he managed to get his scaly hands around the gem-headed man's neck and strangle him until he submitted, and he began to talk even as he died, something about dragon hides and Dragon's Essence and alchemy and two strange, confusing words repeated over and over: "Hail Frontacia!"

Darronogan moaned in agony.  His heart was broken and his mind would never be quite the same again; his brother had been life to him, and now his life was gone in a heartbeat.  His twin's killer was dead, but that was not enough to him; he felt obliged to seek out this city where the skins of innocent dragons were sold on the open market and Dragon's Essence meant life to so many people that it was taken without so much as a "May I?"  He set off in a tormented march toward civilization, to learn--and to avenge, even if it meant turning to the chaos his brother had despised to gain the power he would need. 

 ...The figure on the bluff followed the Frontacian's path with his shadowed eye for a moment, then broke away.  He had a better plan than leaping down upon the lone mage; he might have attacked this magick-loving coward alone back when Darsnovak had lived, but he was wiser now, and he had a grander idea.  He looked down at the majestic city, and in his mind's eye he saw the city in flames, and himself above the havoc, basking in the chaos he had come to love, crying out the name of his fallen brother and finally avenging the tragic death of Darsnovak DragonCenturian.  He smiled at his vision, whispering to himself that it would happen soon, sooner that he himself would expect.  He ran a perspiring finger along the blade of his greataxe and imagined that it was not sweat he felt but blood, the blood of the city that had spawned his brother's killer and would soon fall for its folly.  He smiled mirthlessly, unpleasantly.  He could almost hear the dying Spurians calling out his name, begging for the mercy he did not have.  Then he frowned.  No lips had ever uttered the name Darronogon save Darsnovak's, and these filthy sewer rats that called themselves Spurians had no right to speak a word Darsnovak had used.  He thought for a moment--Tombfyre, Tombfyre for the fiery, blazing death he would bring; yes, that would do; Tombfyre DragonCenturian, harbinger of death.  He trod silently down the path toward the twilight city and its thousands of inhabitants.

Soon they would all be dead, Darsnovak's wrongful death avenged.

Vengeance would be his.

In this article I will tell you a few things you should have and do before you go to Spur. I will also tell you a few things that you might need to know while in Spur.

I.Before going to Spur: 
A. What you should have:
1. Before coming to Spur you should get your primary weapon skill up to level 5 and be
ready to train to level 6.

2. If you have channeling, use every rune you have while there, and a good place to use the healing or vigor rune is at the gate by the cemetery(also a good place to use first aid), and you can use the fire rune on shades that come by(If they still do, haven't been to TG in a while)

3.Work on a secondary, and maybe even a third weapon skill up to at least level 3 or 4, just enough to be able to hit and kill rogue easily(Well easier than level 1)

4.It's a good idea to get disarm to level 5, cause it is hard to disarm rogues at level 1

B.What you should do:
1:Put all your money in the bank before coming to Spur.

2.If you must carry money, retreat 3 or 4 UD's back, retreat a weird number back so if a person wants to pickpocket you they'll have to take time to type TACT which'll give you more of a chance to get away.

3.Don't ask one person all your questions. Ask one to three questions, and go to a
different place to ask someone else more questions.

4.If a person does attack you, don't stand there and ask why they are attacking you cause they probably have a stupid response that isn't worth dying to hear. So if this happens RUN.

5.Get to know someone before you ask them to lead you somewhere. Look to see how
other people react to them and how they react to other people. If people are mean to them or dislike them, they might just take you somewhere you don't want to go , or lead you off to a secluded place and kill you.

6.Learn your way around, so you won't have to always depend on another person, cause
they might not always be around.

7.Don't wander around places where you can't hit anything, cause it's an easy way to
die.(That's a No-Brainer)

8.Try to help people out any way you can

II. While in Spur
A.Places to hunt ,what level you should be at to hunt them, and the way to get there from TS
1.Rogue field-Level 4-15 
Here are the directions from TS: South till you get to a gate, go through the gate, south, south, southwest, south, south, southeast, southeast, south till you get to a gate go gate, and your there.

come.

3.Big skeleton closet- skeletons (10), same as above about the Fams

4.Thieve's Maze- Old rogues, rogues, thugs, assassins, thieves, master thieves, stalkers, and rabid dogs.(Master thieves are the strongest thing in there)

5.Smuggler's Tunnel- Landsharks, smugglers, battle cats, and all sorts of rats and
rodents. (If you go through the rubble you'll be where those Little Things and Critters are, I suggest running from these unless you got real good mail, and are at a high level in your primary weapon skill)

6.Fairgrounds- Thugs, rats and rodents, and thieves (Maybe a master thief, but that would be rare)

C.What not to do while hunting
1.Don't hunt things that are to tough for you*

2.Don't strip other people's kills**

3.Don't disarm something someone else is fighting +

4.When you walk into a room someone else is fighting in, try to wait until they have
knocked the creature down, or they kill it, so that it will not follow you. +

5.Don't walk into a room someone else is fighting in and just start attacking creatures + (possibly a * if they are mean or in a bad mood)

6.DON'T DISARM TOWNIES**

7.DON'T KILL TOWNIES***

+ means that it is a good way to get yelled at
*means it is a good way to get killed
** means it is a very good way to die fast
*** I hate you and hope you choke on the item you get off these innocent bystanders (Those people that don't attack until they are attacked first- they include
nobles,townsperson, town crier, merchants, traders, and dogs (Normal not rabid))

Thanks for reading this and I hope it helps you out in some way, and if you see me
around and want some help, feel free to ask.

A star shines outside of my window tonight,
One star in the darkness, so beautifully bright.
The warmth it gives off dries the tears from my eyes
As it twinkles and shimmers through shadowy skies.
And I think I hear a footstep, soft and faint, from just behind,
As of someone slinking through the night, with mischief on his mind.
And oh, so very silently, a touch upon my face,
A tender touch to brush away the sorrow's final trace.
I think of you, and speak your name, as quiet as can be,
And somehow I can still conjure your face's memory.
The laughter in your eyes has always cheered me when I'm down,
Your voice as smooth as velvet black, your roar a fearsome sound.
Your matchless generosity was never far away,
Your acts of kindness always kept the cruelest thoughts at bay.
I look down deep within my heart; somehow I know you're there,
The feeling of your nearness comforts me beyond compare.
A star shines outside of my window tonight,
One star in the darkness, so beautifully bright.
It is your star, and it shines as other stars have never shone,
And as long as it is shining I shall never be alone.

============================================================================
It's that time again folks!!!! Not for streaking, but for the top 5's! After taking a few issues off our loving editor spoke a few words of wisdom and encouraged me to get back on the job. This months categories were; the best dressed Spurian, worst dressed Spurian, top Spurian gladiator, most evil Spurian,and the most helpful Spurian. Votes were collected over a two-week period and any member of spur was aloud one vote per category. The votes are tallied for each category and the top 5 voted people are posted here! As a side note, something came up this month of the note of cheating. To make it VERY clear you are aloud ONE vote per (ooc) human being, not per SN!!! Also please do not tell people exactly who to vote for, encouraging them to vote is great but sending letters out and telling people to cut and paste what you sent and send it in is also cheating. We are all mature enough not to have to cheat (or so it seems) so please don't, thanks! And here are this months votes!

-Best Dressed Spurian
1.Kassandra the Leuian
2.Rosi the Secian
3.Konichiwa the San Elf
4.Panthera the Leuian
5.Boodla the Go-blin(al?)
Kassandra, Konichiwa and Rosi were within a few votes of each other, but Kassandra managed to sneak past the other two. With that stunning strapless gown and incredible Bikini it's hard to keep up with Kassandra's fashion sense. Konichiwa's Halo and black leather whip are enough to make any guy drool, and Panthera's leather fetish seems to have taken a life of its own =)

-Worst Dressed Spurian
1.Jazbo the Monitanian
2.Fraiser the Oog-ra
3.Melraath the Leuian
4.Hecat the Leuian
5.Alsan the Go-blin(al?)
What can you say about the worst dressed Spurian's? Their clothes may clash, their styles may be out, or they may just not be wearing anything! Whatever it is Jazbo has managed to out do the rest and take the top spot in this category. Take pity on the lizard!!!

-Top Spurian Gladiator
1.Sordum the Psycian
2.Reywind the Anthian
3.Jazbo the Monitanian
4.Kryger the Hithual
5.Saruman the Arachnian
 For the first time in history a dragon didn't make it into the top 5 for gladiators!!! Either the dragons forgot to vote this month, or people forgot about them. Still proving a flying mage is powerful, Reywind pulled in second while Jazbo and his giant pike came in a close third. Kryger has made huge leaps in the last few months taking him into the top 5 gladiators! Following close behind was Saruman, truly one of the best with weapons these days, and a mages nightmare. Ah, and some glower got first =)

Most Evil Spurian
1.Jhered the San Elf
2.Varchild the Secian
3.Kbar the San Elf
4.Vilken the San Elf
5.Melrat the Leuian
Though he has left us, Jhered take the top spot in our most evil Spurian. He will be missed, and remembered as one of the most evil people ever to inhabit spur, the fact he got this spot even after leaving for other lands shows this. Varchild, though a Secian somehow managed to pull third in the most evil Spurians category, Alarian perhaps? Kbar and Vilken round out the 5 in typical San form, truly two of the nastier San's around.

-The Most Helpful Spurian
1.Pepperi the Secian
2.Benni the Secian
3.Kraggon the Hithual
4.Aubrei the Anthian
5.Gemmer the Secian
 The Secian ruled over this category this month, Pepperi took first with Benni just behind. Kraggon and Aubrei managed to sneak onto the list of Secians followed closely behind by the recently returned Gemmer. Make sure to give these people a special thank you when you see them for being so helpful, Spur could use more people like these 5! 

Thanks to all that voted this month, next issue's categories should be up soon.  Special thanks to Michael for inspirational words, and to Fearagoh for being so human.

Sordum.

For those of you who live and die for the gladiator games, this is a helpful hint guide for surviving and winning in the games. 

There are many kinds of games played at many random times. The current known schedule is; Saturday afternoons(basic games), Tuesday afternoons(Vernox's games) and Wednesday afternoon(basic games). Though there really are no set times for games other then Saturday, you can almost count on their being ones on Tuesday and Wednesday as well. On these days there are multiple game possibilities. There are team games, everyone against everyone games(ffa), race games, and get the object games. There are also kill the elder games and drag the elder games, though these are very rare. I won't be listing any tactics for those two, but I'm sure you can come up with some great ones on your own.

The most basic and most often done game is a team game, there are any number of teams, each led by a captain who picks his or her team from the gladiators present. Normally there are 2-4 teams. If you are chosen as a captain my suggestion for picking is to get all the Arachnians, runemages, Psycians, and Leuian weapon users you can. Of course someone who is old with tons of skill from any race is better then a newbie runemage, but from the younger characters go for those races and classes. Multiple Arachnians and Psycians can win you a game pretty easily. As for once the teams are picked and the games actually starts, a huge part of the tactics will depend on how good your team is compared to the others. If you find yourself highly outclassed either get your entire team to hide, or go to the top floor and wait there. Either way you need to wait till the other teams beat each other down enough for your team to have a chance. One of the best tactics I have seen is to combine a khat with a mage or two and let them run loose. Take your team to the top floor, get one mage to cast a wood wall on the khat, another to put a blue aura on so all other magick will not affect them, then set the khat loose. With a strong weapon and good weapon skills they are un-hittable, immune to magick, and immune to damage from psycians bolts and other large damage dealing things. Even cast a white on the khat if you have enough time so they can kill the psycians as well. The key to a team game is timing, and working together as just that, a team. Getting just the right amount of healers, flyers, webbers, glowers, mages, and weapon users can help insure you a win. And waiting till just the right moment to strike on another team can be even more devastating then having a great team.

The next type of game is everyone against everyone games, other wise known as FFA games. There are a few tactics in these games that can make a world of difference for you. The number one thing is knowing your enemies. If someone comes into a room with you who can kill you easily, don't sit around trying to hurt them, simply run! At the same time there are certain races who, if they catch you off guard are you're biggest threats, when you see someone like that instead of them catching you wait for them to make a mistake, then kill them. Finding a psycian trying to use first aid on themselves is a great example, run in hard and fast before they have a chance to fight back. If you are to young, or not skilled enough to stand up to the other people in the game, hide in the middle room till the end and hope for better chances when there are only a few people left. As I said, the key to winning a FFA is knowing who you can beat, and who to run from. FFA's are another game of timing, and if you can get the timing right anything can happen.  

Race games are just like team games in nearly every way, but instead of captains picking the teams, the teams are formed based upon certain races teamed together. Race games follow the same basic rules for survival as teams. Make sure you understand your teams' strong points, and more importantly your weaknesses, don't let that weakness get exposed. Leave those races you cant fight for the other teams to take care of for you. As with the other two, timing is key.

Get the object is perhaps the most odd game of all. An item is dropped to be picked up by anyone in the arena, the goal is to be the one holding the object after a certain amount of time. Other then finding the object on the ground, the only way to get it is to kill the one carrying it and search it off them. My suggestion for getting the item is to wait for someone to kill the person, then for that person to search it. While they search for it you pick it up and run. Once you get the item you are on your own, all I can say is run for your life =)

I hope this guide makes the games not only more fun for you, but more productive! Next month I should hopefully have a guide for the Spurian Gladiator Association games which is rumored to be starting up again. Look for details and good luck!--------Sordum.

Distance by Johnny Bravo

I looked into her ice blue eyes
and knew that she was the one
in longing in loving and in my heart
there was room for no one else

She's so close but I can not hold her
I can only imagine and dream
of a time that we are together again
but I don't know if that will ever be

In distance I start to have my doubts
With distance I must have faith in my dreams
From distance I keep those long lasting hopes
as distance is never as far as it seems

She truly is my heart
that I do believe
and if her spirit is with mine
then Distance means nothing to me

The So-Called "Cabbit Encyclopedia"

Dear readers,

As the Flerian who officially brought Cabbits into Spur, I'd like to comment that the history and
nature of the Cabbits that was written by "Esper-chan" is, almost entirely, inaccurate.  This was
done with very little research of the very extensive Cabbit lore*, and I would just like to point out
that this heinous act of slander on the poor defenseless Cabbits should be ignored.

For example, cabbits and meeps are in NO WAY related.  No relation whatsoever.  And they, of
course, START NO WARS.  They are simply not intelligent enough (like any animal) to organize
such a thing.

Cabbits are a rather passive and gentle race, although they do not enjoy the company of others
of their species (contradicting Esper's statement that they travel in herds); this is why seeing just
one cabbit is extremely rare, let alone two at once.

Cabbits were not, of course, created in a "lab"... because of course, nothing like that exists in
Spur.  The original cabbit was the product of the copulation of a cat (Ca) and a rabbit (bbit).

The only ounce of truth within the statement aforementioned is the allusion to the consumption of
Cabbits as a delicacy by the Elders.  Without mentioning any names, of course, I have been
witness to several Cabbits being devoured by those associated with Elders.

If, by any chance, there are any more questions or disagreements, please ask ME and not Esper,
because he frankly hasn't a clue what he's talking about in regards to my furry little friends.  Or,
you can consult "Compendicum Cabbitius" for most needs.

Thank you,

ChibiChibi

PS... Esper is NOT me. =P
