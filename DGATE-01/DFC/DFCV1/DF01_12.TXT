Greetings Citizens of Spur,

Well, this month proves to be the largest DFC I've ever done, or read…Most of it's still spinning in my head, and I'll just keep this short. I tried to keep up with the typos, well, the plain ones..and it was quite a task, so it's here in it's full glory, so don't look at me. Enjoy and keep it up…

Anthiandishes by Guztymne Horawytz (This is dedicated to all who enjoy humor, even at their own expense)

"::pokes Guz and gives Zuril a large pot::"
"::boils the birdie::"
"	Hmmm…..Hungry"
"::pokes Guz with a fork:: He's done!"
"::hands you a slice of boiled Anthian"

-Examples from ONE day of going into DGate Chat-

Imagine the stereotypes that an Thugian receives as being unintelligent- if you think that's bad, imagine being branded as "The Official Dish of Spur" or the "Grand Poultry".  Fun?  Probably (Actually, it's hilarious, ... but ::furrows his brows and tapes his brows in an angry position) .. But I'm serious here!  Anthians are not chickens.

Anthians are not chicken.  Anthians are not.. oh, why bother?

Anthians are humanoids- which means we're like angellic creatures- we don't have talons, unfortunately.  But we certainly do not have beaks, etc, since we don't get a "bite" attack either.  Just wings.  A blessing that, other than Anthians, only the secians can boast of.  But then, who cares of tiny pixies that prance around?  Anthians-  are not chickens.

(In Anthian-script, with a translation of some passages)

To new Anthians,

If you find yourself in hot water (literally, meaning), do something.  Don't stay there until you can't feel your feet, or you see your skin turning very red and/or peeling.  Fly.  If you can't fly, scream.  And if that doesn't help, scream.  But always remember than you can fly.

I personally have never been boiled, but I've heard stories- stories you don't want to know.  Spur does need its adventurers, and if you hear these stories- true or false, no one knows- you may turn back.  But some Dragons, a couple sentinel races, but most especially the Arachnian race, beware.  Am I the only one who has seen that jagged Anthian leg bone?  I'm rather surprised that it wasn't devoured on sight.  Bloody, cute.  Perhaps because we are a flying race, while they are a webbing race (see the relationship?) that causes a certain disdain.

But don't make the assumption on all Arachnians or other races.  One of my earliest bestest (best-estestestest) friend is an Arachnian.  Well, he's more of a benefactor thing, but, he is the few people who I knew since Training Grounds.  I witnessed 2 Arachnians turn their lives around from townspeople-killing and/or smiting.

All in all, keep an eye out for kitchen utensils.  And if a gang of Leuians invite you to the kitchen in the Governor's mansion (where the cook is), do be wise.

Truly,
Guztymne.

The Truth about Khat's and Thugs
By Solic Xacar
The Heaviest Drinker that doesn't get drunk!
Songwriter

Ok, lets get this started. For those of you who don't know me, I am Solic Xacar, and I feel sorry for you not knowing me. Those who do know me call me "Fat songwriter," "Big Sol," "It's the dancer," and sometimes "Sing boy!" Mostly, I am here for one purpose: to have a good time. I don't like fighitng like some of my ferocious brothers, but don't hate it. Isn't the pen mightier than the sword? If not, I'll kill ya with my metal pen and poke your eyes out! But, lets get down to buisness.

I decided to come here, to the DFC, to tell you, the reader, the truth about everything. Yes, everything you ask about. I'll answer for you the most insane questions you could ask, everything from "Why can't I still figure out how to move," to "Hey, if a arrow goes at a tree half the distance every time it is fired, does it hit the tree at all?"

First off, here's some general know how, for all of you who need to understand the basics. First off, don't ask anyone where the stores on. Second, don't let reywind initiate you. Third, don't trust anyone. Except maybe me, depending on the mood I'm in! ::winks:: Here are acouple of the letters, sent to me, (screen name ALERR if you need advice) and, my humble answers.

Q: Ok, I'm a new guy in the spur. Everyone's not nice to me. It's really annoying, and I'm stumbling into the arena at the wrong times. I'm also losing many more levels than I wanted to. Please help me! A monitanian stuck with death

My monitanian friend, don't give up so easily. First off, don't go into the 2nd portucullis in the arena. Tough guys are in there, don't go in till your primary weapon skill is somewhere around 15, I'd say. Second, you can't find no friends? Ok, your friends will come to you, honest to goodness. Try hanging around members of your race for some help with your levels, and don't try getting on the bad side of people. Two words: BE HUMBLE!!! That is the number one way to survive your first month!

Q: I'm still too weak for the Haunted House, arena, and rogue fields!!! HELP ME!!!
Lost leuian

Ok, this is serious. Did you enter from the Training Grounds? I hope so, or else your stuck. It's very valuable to the youngun's to start there for early levels. Otherwise, I'd say go to the little used abandoned shack. It's north-east two times from the TS, through the tunnel, and you'll have to search for the secret trap door. Inside are skeletons and rodents, perfect pray for your whistling daggers, battle-axes, or maces, whichever you perfer. Stick around there till you only get one use per hit, then move to the rogue fields till about level 7 in your primary weapon skill, or until you get one use. Or, you can also move to the Haunted House's skeleton closet, but you better pray you got some agility at those young levels, or some giant quartz or steel mail for limited protection! Once your around level 7 in your weapon skill, well, don't let this supposed power get to your head. Your just about ready for the arena, I would suggest going in at level 8 or 9, and stay till your about 12. If you stil do nothing, well then, you just suck, and re-roll!

Those two letters where the most distressed, sorry your's didn't get printed, it wasn't important enough!!  But I'll personally respond to everyone of your letters, if that makes you feel better. Now, to some  gossip and a top ten list: 

I heard a weird rumor from unnamed sources that the people on the ship are really sacrifices to the Archdemon, in a desperate effort to save the spur from utter destruction from a total invasion with the Archdemon and Soros. Lets pray this isn't true, we will lose some of our greatest warriors and friends if so.

I heard a nasty rumor that I found about 5 more women. Ok, that's not true... Yet.... Well, I won't say. Lets just say that I have increased my role in helpin' out people ::winks:::


And now, the top ten list from the tunnel's under the Forge and Circle Tower,

Top Ten Reasons that life now sucks:

10: The people that made life fun are all in jail!
9: You realize that people were leaving because of you.
8: A usil elf beat you in a sword fight!
7: Whenever an invasion comes you try to beat up the archdemon with a dagger and level 5 sharps...
6: Finally, after many years of waiting, you leave the TS!
5: You think that your lover left you, you leave the spur, and she returns, kills herself, you return, you kill yourself, and then re-roll to find out she's alive, and find a certain leuian chasing her! 
4: A flerian calls you skinny!
3: You finally saved up for that million dollar sword but realize rehas is gone!
2: The auctions are now selling you!

and, the number one reason that life sucks now,

1: Your AOL bill comes in!

Agent of S.A.N. Mission #72, Full Agent Status

This has been dedicated to Chelestra.

I am tired, wet, and bored out of my mind. Oh, and yes, I'm still on the "Love Boat".  As I sit on the hard, damp, deck, dreams of Sugar Plums and Secians dancing in my head, I remembered back, back to when I had become a full Agent of S.A.N. This was before I met Chelestra or Jimbo, they have been members much longer than I.  The morning I received the assignment, I was hitting a rogue with some sharp thing.  This is nothing new, I do it all the time.  Really to much, If you must know. Anyways, I was hitting this said rogue, and he was hitting me back, and we were having a bloody good time when we were interrupted.  My fam, which I had lost some where, and hadn't gotten back, since he's a moron, finally, flew in, smelling of Peppermint.  The rogue ran away, and I noticed the scroll inside the vulture's beak.  I retrieved it and crawled back to Town Square, forgetting totally about my poor, now deceased, pet.  Upon reaching Town Square, I attempted to read the scroll while the overworked Secians attempted to replace my entrails.  It read:

Dear Aubrei,

Your time has come. Starting tomorrow, your journey to become a full fledged Agent of S.A.N. Tell no one, not that you have anyone to tell.  Your mission: Retrieve the Golden Medallion of Unknown from the Highest, most Dangerous Peak in the Realms.  Or buy it. The choice is yours, good luck,  Commissioner "Shortly"

Well, I must say, after I regained consciousness, I was flabbergasted.  What to do? After thinking about it, I decided to go the easy way, buy it. After all, I wear Ivory Mail. It protects something under 2...  But how, how to get the money? I decided to create a list of ideas to get the money:
1.  Sell Guztymne to the Taathians. This one was rejected because they would want me to pay for them to take him.
2.  Write for the DFC: Nope, I'd never get published
3.  Go on a long never ending, boring as heck boat ride: Never happens
4.  Beg: This one had promise, but I wasn't sure
5.  Contact the SSFLS, demanding funds in order to move a forum leader out of harms way: I didn't have a forum leader that needed moving
6.  Beat up Rogues, alot: This is the one I went with

After much, much work, I was able to save the money that I needed. I purchased a Golden Medallion of Unknown, and brought it to S.A.N. headquarters. Now, this isn't the magnificent HQ it is now, no, this was mearly the most magnificent lean-to you've ever seen.  After noticing that even my 4'2" frame had to bend to enter, I pressented the Medallion to a shadow with eyes in the Corner, Commisioner "Shortly".  She said " No, Aubrei, this test had a dual purpose, one, to prepare you for your next assignments, and two, to give you a personal possecian that doesn't suck Oog- ra.  Nodding, I listened as she finished he schpiel. " Now, you must read and accept the S.A.N. charter. She handed me a list , which went something like this
Things to do:
Get milk, eggs, and mints
Recharge Runes
etc....
"Oops" she said, this is the Charter" She handed me yet another list: 
Agent of S.A.N. Charter
These are the Rules that every S.A.N. Agent must follow, or break, but never both.
1.  Never, ever get really angry. In order to maintain your anominity, you may feign anger, but it may never be real.
2.  Hug Secians when you see them, if they don't hug you back, and you feel anger coming on, refer to Rule one.
3.  Get a Trenchcoat, Brown, or Black
4.  Have it cleaned once in a while. Gamey smelly coats do not give us a good reputation.
5. Join as many useless, but fun, organizations and/or families as possible.
6.  Never, ever tell anyone about us, except to say that your an Agent of S.A.N. , and that they should definitely not be relieved in the least.
7.  If you must reveal our secrets, get paid, alot. 
8. Make many, many, friends, then have petty disputes constantly.
9.  Get lot's of really cool stuff.
10.  If not possible, be friend with people who have really cool stuff.
11. If you have an imperfection, blame it on the taxes.
12. If you ever make a mistake in a mission, abort, move to the Rogue Fields, and farm Turnips.  
"Do you understand?  She asked  " Yes" I responded, and signed myself to Commissioner Shortly.  "Good Luck" she said " And may the Happiness be with you...

That is the story of how I became an Agent of S.A.N.  Now, to return to the voyage, since I fell asleep I missed, um, nothing... Oh well...

Secian Wisdom
by Wampa Kyes

Hi, Wampa here with even more bits o' wisdom. I know you don't see me much anymore,
but believe me, I'm still here. I also want to wish luck to everyone in (or out) of the Spur
right now. Now, back to the wisdom part of this:

10. It is rude to disguise yourself as a person, then pull on that person's hair.
9. Don't believe people who say you will get healthier with their "magickal" dirt ring.
8. Don't drink half of a bottle of Muatana-ale and wonder why you can't stay standing.
7. Don't cover a barn in sheets, add fog, and put on a skellie mask and say it's the Haunted
House.
6. If it looks like a newt, sounds like a newt, and walks like a newt, it's more likely a thief in
disguise.
5. Don't say things like "ghtdig" and say you're speaking alarian.
4. Don't believe rouges who say the Training Grounds are to the east.
3. It is rude to tackle (and squish) small people in TS (e.g. Secians)
2. Always judge a peddler by his merchandise.
1. Flattering may get you somewhere.

SOMETHING TO PONDER - Armonius Undermount

For nigh on two years in the Spurian calendar I have pursued the path of the Sword Cleric under the auspices of the Sword Cleric Guild of Spur. In this time, I have seen much, learned a great deal, and met many - some great, some but barely weaned from their mothers, and most somewhere in between. It has been both a wondrous experience and a sore trial at times.....yet I feel that we are shaped by the events in our life, both good and bad.

One of the things I have been involved with during my time here was the Council of Clerics. This group has undeniably had its share of problems, yet through the hard work and dedication of a few was on the verge of something wondrous prior to the governor's imposition of the unjust (in my opinion) taxes.

What I speak of is a Code of Conduct for the Clerics of Spur. Before I explain what this Code consists of, I should explain the reasons I pushed strongly for its adoption:

- At any given time in Spur, about half of the people wandering about are clerics of the various orders. Many have chosen the path of a cleric, particularly a sword cleric for the advantages such a choice offers (good combat skills, excellent healing ability, good offensive spells, increased communion with your deity when praying, special prayers, and turning of the undead). It saddens me to see this be the reason for becoming a cleric. I would say that the only reason to become a cleric is your intense personal desire to serve your deity and your deity's purpose.

- The initial information provided for clerics is sketchy at best. Here it is in its entirety: The responsibilities of a cleric of any deity are 1) Dedication and continued contribution to a deity. 2) Upholding of the deity's standards and possession of one or more of the deity's holy symbols. 3) The conversion of any member (requiring such) to the ways. 4) The proper use (according to the deity) of any divinely spells. 5) Proper use of the implements of war.

Alright.....how many of ye clerics follow these guidelines? I for one, had a problem with even understanding what each really meant. I suspect many clerics never even looked at them and gave it thought. So my purpose in developing a Code of Conduct was to embody these principles into some concrete tenets, which are readily understood and can actually be accomplished.

Having said all that here is the Code of Conduct:

"The following are the ten pillars upon which the Greater Temple of Spur are built.

One, I will honor my deity through my demeanor and daily actions.

Two, I shall respect my Temple Heirarchy and seek guidance from its rightful leaders.

Three, I will follow the tenets of the Cleric Council of Spur.

Four, I will respect the individual religious choices and belief of others.

Five, I shall respect the sanctity of all temples and enter temples other than my own only upon invitation or in great need.

Six, I will assist others in need without excessive regard to compensation, profession, or religion.

Seven, I will not harm citizens or domesticated creatures unless attacked first.

Eight, I shall make every effort to tithe one-tenth of my earnings to my temple as a symbol of my devotion and to set an example for the faithful.

Nine, I will attend at least one Council of Clerics meeting per calendar month and when doing so present a demeanor which honors my deity and fellow-worshippers.

Lastly, Ten, I will endeavor to educate and aid the novitiate followers of my deity and pass on my wisdom and experience to others."

Well, there it is....short, clear, to-the-point. I envisioned the clerics of Spur who agreed to accept the Code of Conduct as swearing to such during a ceremony at which the "re-devoted" cleric would receive a symbol of his dedication. This would mark him (or her) as a recognized and sanctioned member of the Spurian Clergy. Those of us on the Council of Clerics, which included representatives of most faiths (including Taathian), had agreed to the above code as being followable by clerics of ANY faith.


I still feel strongly that adoption of such a Code would have some tangible benefits: 
1) It is a statement of support for the clergy as a whole. 2) Improves effectiveness of the Council of Clerics in both purpose and conduct. 3) Generates increased awareness of the clergy on the part of Spur's citizens. 4) Re-focuses the individual Cleric's devotion to the basic tenets of his faith.

So why do I take the time to write this?

There are several reasons. The foremost is I care....I care about my home, my friends, and even those of ye I have never met. The second is that since the tax began, there has not been any guidance provided to the clergy and the Council has not re-convened. The last is I have been saddened by the behavior of many who claim to follow the Gods of our pantheon. Those of ye who happened to be in Town Square when the Avatars appeared or when Oisin and Merlin spoke of the Chaos Lords know what I mean. I saw blatant disrepect, immaturity, and outright blasphemy from more than one who is supposed to be a faithful worshipper of any deity ye might choose.

At the least, I pray that the above may make even one cleric think....for even one alone, be they true of heart, faith and purpose may make a profound difference.

Be well and may peace favor your sword,

Armonius Undermount
High Priest of Unknown

The Rumor Mill

Something strange happen to you while you were alone in the cemetery? Did a troll in the Haunted House suddenly start talking to ya? Did something whisper in you ear? Have you seen strange flashes in the sky or mysterious visitors to Spur?

This isa my attempt at trying to keep e'eryone up to date on the sometimes strange happenings in an around Spur. Some o' it isa facts, some o' it isa rumor an I can't vouch that alla it isa true. ;o)  If something strange or exciting happens that you know  about or heard about let me know!

Ruby Rumbles an Sapphire Skies
Two more glorious stagings have taken place! Slepinfire has joined his brothers an sister in the air, blinding Spurians with the glare from his ruby scales. Luckily, his bondmate Sylvenn was able to return from Secia in time to help his dragon through the very painful process. An jus a few days ago Axiom Brakken staged with the help o' his bondmate Rosi Isor. Axiom isa handsome Sapphire dragon! Congratulations to the dragons an Secians. Who will be the next dragons to stage?

Demon Dilemma
I suppose if you have been living in the skeleton closet you might not o' heard about the demons that have been popping up all ‘round Spur. As most already know, the trouble started when Thoro Hav'Shal the Noble Dragon purchased a certain amulet at an auction put on by Simeonius the Dragon Merchant. Supposedly cursed, the amulet would attract demons to chase the owner. Well, not only did the demons chase the owner, but they decided to overrun Spur. The demons were not verra happy with jus being summoned by Mr. Hav'Shal, they wanted  control o'er the amulet. Unable to bribe Thoro for the amulet,  they offered rewards to the citizens o' Spur. At some point Thoro was relieved o' his terrible burden whilst suffering the affects of a sleep dart. Jazbo the Monitanian picked up the amulet, and alas, after changing hands it wasa given to the archdemon. Once he had control o' the amulet, the demon started popping up in various spots around our beloved city an the surrounding areas using the amulet to summon more demons. One such place wasa the Dragon's Lair which he fled after Michael Stormbringer the 2nd stage Dragon an Sordum Corinth the Psycian gave him a good thumping. Now, it has since been revealed by Simeonius that on an island somewhere offa the coast o' Spur a key isa hidden. This key will open a path to the demon realm. Several brave adventures left Spur on a vessel bound for the island.  Along with the trip being verra lonely, the arch demon , storms, monsters an e'en sirens continued to plague the remaining travelers. Unfortunately, as the adventurers neared their destination, a storm more terrible than all those before it sank the ship, blowing many o' the passenger to Spur while some had to return later in life boats. What can now be done to save Spur from the demons? We can only wait an see.

Shackled San
That San about town, Jhered Narbondel hasa been seen recently sporting a rather odd accessory to his wardrobe, a leather fidelity leash from his wife Jainelle. One can only imagine what Jhered did to earn such a prize.

BlackRobe Blackmail
A strange visitor arrived in Spur many weeks ago an none took much notice of him, until now. Dunith, a Penthanian scientist, reportedly hasa been researching a theory o' his that Spurians appear to lack brains. In order to carry out his research it seems Dunith must preform dissections o' many research subjects. Unfortunately for him, he dissected the wrong Taathian priest. Now they are a little miffed at having one o' Taath's faithful followers picked apart an want Dunith for Taath's sacrificial altar. In order to demonstrate their great desire they have sent invasions to Spur o' dark revenants, dark terrors, an the always popular smiting blackrobed priests. They have promised continued attacks until Dunith is turned o'er to them. Dunith was last seen fleeing Town Square chased by a swarm of Taathians. 

Soros Surfacing?
Rumors are flying that Soros may be returning, an he may be after Secians. At this  time nothing more about this possible return o' Spur's biggest bad guy isa known. 

Melraath's Merchant Mess-up
It seems one o' Spur's most notorious thieves, Melraath SilentPaw the Leuian, hasa picked the wrong pocket. During a recent auction Vrilken the Bard Merchant wasa picked by Melraath of approximately three an a half million silver, two million o' which he hasa since returned. He also reportedly killed the merchant more than once an relieved him o' his lyre. this o' course led to another strike by the merchants. But, the much maligned law in Spur did catch up to him, an Melraath was put on trial, receiving three days in jail for pick pocketing an one week for the ‘justified' killing o' Vrilken an the theft of his lyre (reports say it was in self defense after Vrilken used a musical spell to cause Melraath to dance around like a fool). He was also ordered to repay the one million in silver he still owes Vrilken an another 100,000 for damages. 

Missing Meanie?
Rumors abound that Jhered Narbondel hasa finally breathed his last. While many refuse to believe that this dark master o' Chaos could really be gone, it has been several days since he was last seen in Spur. Maybe alla those hugs from Secians finally got to him.

An last but definitely not least,  congratulations to two New Rezzers! Remember ta be a good ghost an always pay your rezzer when back in your body!

============================================================================
Today was like any other mid-summer day. The sun was hot and the air was thick.  But one thing was different--I was about to leave on a long walk.  I like to take a walk now and then so that I may be alone; well, alone as one can be with a squawking, annoying raven sitting on one's shoulder...  This particular day I walked to clear my head and find peace within myself.  Before I departed, my brother Draffut gave me paper and a quill with which to record my journey.  He loves to read my stories (though I not know why), so I agreed to accept his gift.  

It has been only a couple of hours since I began my journey and left the arch to Spur.  Forgetting to eat this morning, I have stopped in a small clearing in a forest to have a bite and to write this.  Sitting here under the sun, I meditate for awhile to prepare myself for my journey.  My Brother, you should go on such a walk some day!  The peace that fills my soul is extraordinary; so much so, in fact, I cannot begin to describe it.  I have only a few hours of good daylight remaining, and there are some mountains towards the northwest that I wish to have a closer look at. I shall write more when I make camp tonight.

After an uneventful but enjoyable first day I have made camp under a tall tree in the forest.  The base of this huge old tree seems to wrap around me, giving my weary back some support. I am quite comfortable.  Do not worry, Brother, I shall not let my defenses down too much.  I do keep an ear out for noise. So far, only the creatures of the forest frolicking in the sunset are audible.  As I watch the sun set behind the smallest of the mountains, I figure it shall be nearly a good day's walk to reach their base.  I am feeling a bit home-sick now and miss my family, but the ale Armonius gave me is settling my nerves some and I begin to relax into a sleep. So with that, I shall bid you good.......

My apologies, Brother! I must have dozed off last night.  Although the night was peaceful and relaxing, this morning I awoke with a start as I heard footsteps in the distance.  Quickly I found some shadows and fixed my eyes toward the noise.  Soon, a darkly-dressed human stepped through a clump of small trees. He crept foward, eyeing my camp. Deciding no one was about, he slowly started opening my pack I had left lying near the tree.  He then turned his back to where I hid and began to pilfer my belongings.  Quietly, I stepped out of the shadows and crept up behind him. A sudden feeling of bravado possessed me; I gave a slight cough.  

The man spun around with a dagger in his hand and, in the blink of an eye, cut a small slash into my torso.  Stunned at his quick reflexes, I allowed myself to be struck again. This time it was my left arm and a bit deeper.  I heard a squawk from above, and my senses snapped back.  Leaping back into stance, I pulled my mask up over my face. I eyed the stranger with anticipation, awaiting his next move. My leap had startled him and his eyes grew wide, but his first two swings had given him confidence. He lunged once again with his dagger!  I quickly grabbed his wrist with one hand and his elbow with the other: With one quick movement and a snap, his sword-arm was useless.  The stranger howled in pain and fled into the woods.  

Pulling the mask back down into my cowl, I let myself relax somewhat.  I then sat and healed my wounds and packed up camp.  I felt triumphant, but had to scold myself for being careless enough to allow the interloper to spill my blood.  I shall stop writing now and head for the mountain.
 
I am now but a couple hours from the base of the closet mountain.  I have stopped here at the northern edge of a large field for lunch.  I drink just a very small bit of my ale with my rations, as I never could handle too much at one time.  Finishing my meal I sit for a while letting the wind cool me.  I remembered it has been over a day since I have kneeled to Elindale in prayer, so I smoothed out a place in the dirt and kneeled down and prayed to my goddess.  Doing so always brightens my heart and feeds my soul.  But I have spent too much time at lunch now and must again set off.
   
I reached the mountains' base and walked around looking for anything interesting.  Just an hour before sunset I discovered a small hole in the side of the rocky cliff.  I went in and found myself in a rather large cave.  Inside the cave there were several other small openings leading off in various directions.  It is as I sit contemplating a foray into one or another of them that I write this.  After careful consideration I decided to take one of the larger passages to the north.  

As I started into the cave I heard behind me...
"Awk, please Master, do not make me go any farther in these caves; it does not feel right in here."  I chuckled and turned to my faithful pet raven, saying 
" Of course old friend, you may stay here. Just be careful and keep an eye out, for I know not what is in here."  With that, Blackwind perched high on a small cleft in the southern wall of the cave. I then heard as I stepped into the cave...
"Oh do be careful master, Awk!"  
" I shall!" I exclaimed. 

It has been three days since my last entry, from what Blackwind tells me.  I am glad I am even able to write this.  For after I entered the cave and walked for some time, I did find something; a great number of something.  I was walking in the dark passage when a strange odor begin to slowly fill the air.  I slowed my pace and started listening to the silence.  

As I continued the smell became stronger, yet still I heard nothing.  I had been creeping slowly along for about forty minutes since I first smelled the odor, but still no sound. The cave got smaller and smaller as I went on.  Soon I was stooped down nearly on all fours, hoping the cave would not get much smaller.  Then, very faintly, I heard the silence break.  Startled, I quickly froze and listened.  Yes, there it was again, a faint...click.  But the size of the cave, the odor, and this noise did not frighten me.  In fact, due to my curious nature I was now in more of a hurry, though I took care to venture forward as silently as possible.  

After several mintues of slow quiet crawling, I noticed a light up ahead. The sounds were growing louder and more defined now.  The noise was rushing into the chamber now, click, click, and I could now hear the scuffling of small feet.  I reached the end of the shaft to find a hole that opened into an enormous cave. It was at least ten times larger then the one Blackwind awaited in, and that was no small cave itself.  Quietly I crawled into the cave, immediately found the shadows, and slipped out of view.  

I then started looking around at my surroundings.  I was amazed at what I saw.  There were some weird glowing rocks which barely illuminated the cave.  The ground was earthen, and there were small mounds everywhere with holes in them that seemed to burrow into the ground.  But what caught my attention most was what was wandering all over the cave.  There were strange creatures carrying bowls and baskets back and forth like a community of ants.  They where the ones making the clicking noises that I heard.  I assumed they were the source of that horrid smell which was much stronger in this central cave, than what I smelled in the shaft.  

They averaged about two feet in height, and weighed about fifty pounds or so.  Their skin was a dark cinnamon color, and yet it looked all most transparent.  They were not very muscular looking, yet seemed as though they might be agile from their size and build. I did notice one deftly jump down from a high mound.   When it did, it spread its arms, and there was a thin membrane under its arms that caught the air, allowing the creature to sail down to a smaller  mound about ten feet away.  

Their eyes were beady, and seemed to glow in the darkness.  They adorned their bodies with no clothing or armor.  The only weapons I could see were long claws and a fierce set of canine teeth that protruded out over their bottom lips.  I sat for a long time in awe watching these strange creatures work. I do not think I ever saw one stop for a conversation with another. In that, they seemed more like animals than the civilized beings they mimicked.  

After studying them for some time I decided to call them Glantings, for it seemed to fit them and I knew not what else to call them.  Eventually I began to get bored.  You can watch others work for only so much time.  But Brother, you know that when I get bored I normally get into trouble... I then noticed one of the Glantings off by himself gathering some material in a small pot. He was barely twenty feet from me.  My natural curiosity took over, and I forgot all about getting into trouble.  

I started making my way slowly toward him, keeping to the shadows.  As I reached him he had just finished filling his small pot and stood up to leave.  Not knowing what else to do I gave a slight hiss.  Their hearing must be sensitive, as he spun around quickly, dropping his pot.  He stared deep into the shadows, which began to scare me.  Then, the Glanting's eyes began to glow brighter and brighter and he jumped back with a gasp.    His brow furrowed wickedly and he started making a very loud clicking noise over and over, faster and faster. I knew I'd been caught and it was appent that he did not wish to talk.  

I stepped closer to him anyway,and in Common tongue said, "Hello, I mean you no harm."  With that he lunged at me, clawing wildly.  I ducked and chuckled to myself as he went screaming over my head.  I did not realize that by turning to see him, I was turning my back on the twelve others that had came in answer to his loud clicks.  As the first one landed I heard a final click.  I turned back to face the room, only to be hit head on by all twelve.  Soon my body was covered by the small creatures clawing and biting me.  Although their attacks were not very painful, their combined effort was overwhelming.

As more and more heeded the alarm I took on more and more wounds.  Shaken, I called out loudly for Elindale to heal me. I felt a shiver as my body glowed from her answer. All my pain of my previous wounds subsided but the wounds were still there.  With that I received a quick second wind and began clawing wildly. Luckily, their frail bodies could not stand up to my claws. But their numbers seemed endless, and with my previous wounds and all the wounds I was still getting, it was just a matter of time.  One by one they fell, as one by one my wounds grew.  Losing blood rapidly, I stumbled back, allowing even more to pounce.  I tried to get to my feet but I blacked out as one jumped straight at my face.  

I opened my eyes slowly, my whole body screaming with pain.  I almost forgot where I was before I gained my wits and refrained from yelling out for help.  I was in a small dirt cave littered with a few rocks and little else.  My feet and hands were bound with odd green twine.  Quietly, I inched my way toward a rock just a foot away and began rubbing the twine on a sharp side of the rock. Once my hands were free, I untied my feet and crawled toward the hole and looked out.  Standing two feet from the hole a single Glanting was standing guard; no others were near. Stepping out of the hole, I reached around the guard's head and sliced his throat with a claw.  I stayed low and in the shadows and hobbled towards the shaft.  

Two feet from freedom I heard an ominous click.  I spun around and a Glanting with eyes growing bright was starring at me.  Without hesitation I silenced him with a quick spin kick to the head, which pained me nearly as much as it must have hurt him.  As I entered the shaft I heard the clicks again.  I turned and five more were in pursuit.  I quickly clawed at the opening behind me, loosening some rocks that fell and closed the opening.  I then turn and hurried as fast as my mangled body could move.  After an hour I fell exhausted into the chamber where I had left my supplies and Blackwind.  

"Awk! Master!...you are alive! Master? Oh dear!"  I sat up slowly and smiled to my raven.  
"Yes old friend, do not worry.  I think I shall survive now."  With that I closed my eyes and begin to meditate upon my wounds.  And after several hours I opened my eyes, now more tired then before. Blackwind flew down and perched on my shoulder, as I reached up with a Cleric's hand and transferred some of his strength to me.  I then opened my pack, rummaged through my supplies and began to stitch my wounds.  (By the way, Armonius' ale came in very handy at this point!)  

After resting some and eating to regain my strength, I got out my pen and paper and wrote this. I do not know why I stayed so long in this cave, knowing the Glantings could have been right behind me.  I guess I just wanted to make sure they were trapped, at least for now.  With some wounds healed and some of my health restored I shall pack up and leave this cave.  I had my fun, and now long for home and family.
  
My first day heading home ended without any excitement.  Sorry I did not write when I reached my campsite last night Brother, but I simply passed out.  Next morning after a hearty breakfast and fresh bandages, I feel much better.  I should be home soon, after stopping one more time just outside the Arch for lunch.

Shortly after leaving my campsite I came upon a dark man with a familiar scent, his right arm in a poorly fashioned sling.  Upon seeing me he shrieked and turned to run, but in his rush he tripped and hit his head on a rock.  Feeling sorry for him laying there unconscious and mangled, I sat down next to him and opened my pack to find some fresh bandages.  I set his arm properly and wrapped it tight, placed a loaf of bread on his chest and set off towards home.  

An hour from the arch I stopped to eat and write this.  I changed one bandage that had come loose and packed up.  I have reached home and no one is here.  Probably all are out hunting as is usually the case.  No matter.  I need a long rest in a comfortable bed anyway, and after a long bath I shall do just that. I think this shall be the first bath that I have openly longed for.  Brother, thus ends my story. I hope you like it.  'Tis so good to be home...

Vrilkyn the Master Bard and Peddler

Greetings, one and all!  This day we shall take a look at one of the most interesting merchants to bring his wares to the Spur.  Namely, one Fir Elf named Vrilkyn.  Sit back and enjoy my tale, as I do my best bardic impression and tell ye about the master bard and his amazing wagon.  This is the tale of the third time I went to one of Vrilkyn's peddles.  It was during this latest encounter that I learned the most about the wandering merchant.

It begins early one fine morn, when I noticed signs that something or another was happening to the south.  I headed off to Meetpoint, running as fast as my little legs would carry me.  When I reached the center square of Meetpoint, I noticed a small crowd there.  It didn't take long for someone to see Vrilkyn's wagon parked just outside the Meetpoint Inn.  Everyone was happy to see that Vrilkyn had returned to our part of the lands, for he always had such wondrous things to sell.

First of all, let me tell ye about the wagon.  It is one huge wagon.  Simple enough in appearance on the outside, the wagon held treasure beyond the ability of this simple Hithual fighter to comprehend on the inside.   When ye step inside, ye are literally surrounded on all sides by true marvels.  Selves, display cases, tables, even the walls, floor, and ceiling, pilled high and covered with wondrous objects.  Strange, mystic torches that gave off no smoke kept the interior well lit.  That day, the peddler had an assortment of fine shields on display just inside the entrance.

Vrilkyn would show us around the wagon, this way and that, trying to decide what he would sell us.  I had never seen such a reluctant merchant, even Hithual ale traders were more willing to part with their wares than Vrilkyn!  He'd show us some fine items, including some very nice helms, but he couldn't seem to decide what he wanted to sell.  He did sell a drop of some mystic potion of some kind that increased ones well-being.  He also showed us a very fine dragon-scaled mail (he said no Dragons died to make the armor), but did not want to sell it until Merlin was around to bid on it also, as Merlin had said he wanted the armor himself.

Vrilkyn then told us to wait in his glade while he got a couple of items to sell.  I'd been there before, of course, but the beauty of that place still takes my breath away whenever I passed through Vrilkyn's magick mirror and into the giant sylvan glade.  Lush grasses gave easily underfoot only to bounce right back when released, and trees of various origins bloom to their fullest.  Unseen wind chimes harmonize together as gentle breeze brushed through the area.  A small pool off to one side was fed by a rainbow colored waterfall, the like of such I'd never seen anywhere else.

Vrilkyn showed up a few minutes later and began to tell us about himself.  After a moment, I realized I'd want notes of what he was saying, so I quickly grabbed a scroll and started writing.

"I am not a merchant who buys wholesale items through slavery and dishonesty," he said.  "I search for adventure!  When I was but a lad, 'bout twentyish, I left home with nothing more than me lyre.  I wanted to see the world.  I wanted to know what was out there and meet the people."

"At first it was rough, this strange elf, wandering 'bout the lands of others.  I would play for a simple meal and boarding.  After a while, as I made seasonal rounds through cities and villages... people began to not only recognize me but welcome me as well.  Instead of just getting room and board for me playing ...they started paying me... and even given me gifts.  First it was nice... but after a while, I was nae able to hold more in my packs.  So, I bought meself a wagon.  And still, I gathered more items."

Vrilkyn said, "After a while, people wanted to buy that which others had given me.  Thus is how I came to be what I am today.  Bard, collector, and to some, a merchant."

Vrilkyn readied a ruby-hilted silver scimitar and said, "Each item is not just some cheap thing.  Some were ‘specially made.  Some have been killed for…"

This led Kraggon to ask, "They be not cursed?"

Vrilkyn shook his head from side to side and said, "I nae sell cursed items."  A valuable piece of information, if ye ask me.

Vrilkyn went onto say, "I've been welcomed from well above the North Sea to the Island of Muldavia itself."  Vrilkyn then mumbled something beneath his breath about a younger Merlin trying to cheat him.  Interesting, I thought.

"This he'er scimitar came from the land of Muldavia.  Well... like it's Muatana-al masters...," said Vrilkyn furrowing his brow as he continued his tale of the ruby-hilted silver scimitar, "This ruby is said to be red of blood.  The scimitar is.. unique."

At this point, Vrilkyn started to demonstrate the scimitars abilities.  First he swung his ruby-hilted silver scimitar at a practice target.  The swing was a good blow to the torso.  Other than the practice target being knocked back, stumbling and falling down, nothing happened.  Vrilkyn scowled at the practice target.  "Hmm," he said.  Then a make-believe rogue wandered in, by Vrilkyn's magick surely, yet I failed to see Vrilkyn cast anything to summon it.  Vrilkyn swung his ruby-hilted silver scimitar at the rogue.  The swing nearly fumbled.  "I be terrible at this,"  Vrilkyn said, as he flailed his arms about wildly.  Then Vrilkyn again swung his ruby-hilted silver scimitar at the rogue and this time it was a good blow to the torso.  The rogue was knocked back, and Vrilkyn seemed to glow with unnatural health and vitality!  Vrilkyn chuckled to himself.

The blade seemed to drain the health from the rogue and transfer it to Vrilkyn.  I asked, a little bit fearfully, "Permanent drain?"

Vrilkyn furrowed his brow and said,  "Don't think so.  But it binds itself to the wielder and they become one in battle."

"Be helpful in defending Spur...," commented Kraggon.

"In the wrong hands...," said Vrilkyn, staring at the ruby-hilted blade.

Kraggon said, "Master Vrilkyn, ye wouldn't let it fall to the wrong hands though..."

Vrilkyn shakes his head from side to side and said, "There is always more than one reason why I do not like to sell my items."

"This scimitar does have a name...if I kin only remember it," said Vrilkyn, furrowing his brow.  "This item could sell no less than 2 million.  I am sorry I kin but be less, but...with its nature...  I dinna take credit.  However, if I do not sell it, it will return to its case, and perhaps be sold at another time."

I supposed none us of assembled in the glade had the money, or those that did were waiting to see what else the Fir Elf had to sell, for none bid on the scimitar.

After a few moments passed, Vrilkyn says, "How about this..."  Vrilkyn placed the ruby-hilted silver scimitar within a black leather weapon harness, and said, apparently remembering the name of the blade, "Moroii can wait."

Vrilkyn then readied a short emerald-hilted Tanto.

On seeing the short blade, Shadowlyn questioned, "Tanto?"

Vrilkyn said, "Tis a dagger-sized katana ifn I remember."

Curious, Shadowlyn asked, "How much it weigh?"

Vrilkyn answered, "One pound."

Vrilkyn placed the short emerald-hilted Tanto within a studded emerald sheath.  "The Tanto... this item comes from an Isle in the North Sea,  from a place which had once been center of worship.  I journeyed there three years ago.  The civilization had been completely destroyed.  This item was encased within a sphere.  Unbreakable.  This sphere floated in mid air...the only thing among this settlement which was untouched.  When our party arrived near the sphere, it...vanished and this dropped at our feet."

"Some call the Tanto the Viper," continued Vrilkyn, "because of its strike."

Kraggon asked, "A poisoned blade, Master Vrilkyn?"

Vrilkyn shakes his head from side to side and said, "Just quick to puncture."

"This can go for no less than 350,000," said the peddler.  After a short wait, with no one bidding yet again, and a couple of coughs from Vrilkyn, he said, "No one wishes to own this fine item?"

Kraggon commented, "Ah, it looks too delicate fer me hands.  Surely worth the price though."  Some of the others commented on not having the funds.  I sure didn't have the silver, having spent my earning on recent purchases of  Everknow and Maille.

Vrilkyn said, "Then fear not.  This is now one of my paths of travel.  I shall return often and if I do not sell it now, you [can] save up for it when I return."  Vrilkyn then chuckled and said, "That is all I had planned on selling for now...I could give you the histories and possible prices of the other items for future references if you wish."

Rainbowedge, Blade, and Khateul started asking about the helms we had seen earlier.

Vrilkyn chuckled.

Kraggon asked, "Master  Vrilkyn, any of the helms from Hithual forges?"

Vrilkyn said, "Many of my items are Hithual forged."

Kraggon commented, "Aye, of course."

"Several of them I have actually acquired from within the Great Citadel itself," said Vrilkyn.  Seeing some questioning faces in the crowd, he asked, "Surely you know of the Citadel?  The great city of the Hithual Nation, deep within the Great Divide."

"The Place of the Chiefs," Kraggon added, with a sigh.

Vrilkyn said, "It is a thriving civilization."

Blade asked, "That's where you acquired some of the helms?"  At the time I got the impression that the answer was yes, but looking through my notes, I don't think Vrilkyn actually said one way or another.

We followed Vrilkyn back into the wagon, and  after selling the second drop out of four he had that increased ones well being, Melraath asked, "Vrilkyn you sellin' any of the helms in that stand over towards the east?"

Vrilkyn said, "Perhaps, perhaps not."

"I kinda like the fools crest," said Melraath with a snicker.

"Ye be a fool?" asked Vrilkyn.

"Accordin' to some," said Melraath.

Vrilkyn said only, "Hmm."  In hindsight, this exchange seems highly ironic seeing as Melraath's infamous pick of Vrilkyn, for millions of silver, and all the trouble both Melraath and Vrilkyn would suffer for it, was soon to follow.

Kraggon asked, "I wonder what the story of the Helm of Lion be, Master Vrilkyn."

Vrilkyn rubbed his eyes and yawned.

Shadowlyn asked, "Tired?"

Vrilkyn nods up and down and said, "I be travel weary."

Hearing this, I decided it was time for me to be going.  As I was on my way out, saying my good-byes, I heard Guaire say, "I would like to purchase Moroii, the scimitar."

Vrilkyn says, "Hmm…this weapon is not sold lightly."

Guaire says, "I understand this, Master Bard."

And so I left, hoping to be able to save enough silvers to maybe get one of the Hithual helms the next time Vrilkyn returned.  I did not actually see Guaire buy Moroii, or witness Melraath pick Vrilkyn for all those silvers, so I'll leave others to tell those tales.  I had learned a lot about Vrilkyn that fine morn, and my respect for him grew immensely.  I hope ye enjoyed the tale, and have a better understanding for the wandering Fir Elf bard, the reluctant peddler Vrilkyn.

Panick's Life- Panick(editor's note: a small portion of the scroll was damaged, the beginning is missing, so forgive the lack of a title-Michael)

I was born in a small village called Pretalia at the base of the Great Mountain.  Its true name I do not know, as my time there was short and I was very young.  But life there was idyllic, the days filled with gathering food, making the necessities, and of course, lots of laughter and merrymaking.  The nights were filled with fellowship and the telling of many stories around the fire.  I cannot remember many of them, for at our age my brother and I were bedded down early.  

My father Gerault was a servant and priest of Sa.  I can recall the magnificent robes he wore on holy days, its mystical runes glittering in the sun.  My brother and I were taught at an early age to honor Sa and his tenets.  I can recall the lessons, the endless lessons, when Trist and I wanted nothing more than to be released to the afternoon to go hunting for mushrooms and the tiny silver fish from the river that flowed nearby.  My mother Dreion was, most of all, kind and wise, and my father adored her.  I can still see her face shining down on me when she pulled the bearskin up to my chin at night, smiling as Trist and I said our prayers at day's end, singing soft lullabies to keep the darkness at bay.

My memory of the Trouble is a bit jumbled, and it pains me to retell it.  I recall a day much like all the others, when my father returned from a trek up the side of the mountain.  He was more upset than I'd ever seen him.  We gathered around him to find out what the matter was.  Visibly shaken, he said he'd had a visitation from Sa Himself and had been warned of a terrible danger that was to befall the village.  He trembled as he told it, saying Taath's minions were gathering as we spoke and our days there were numbered.  My mother wept, I remember, saying surely this could not be true!  My father strode out to tell the others in the village of his horrible vision.

A meeting of the village elders was quickly called.  It was decided that all in the village would pack their belongings and leave for the forest until the terror had passed.  Furious preparations began; all but the tiniest Drag-als were pressed into service gathering up those things most important to us.  Taath might come, but in our stead he would find but an empty shell of a place.  We worked tirelessly for two days.  On the second night we rested, ready to leave our happy home the next morning until the danger had passed.

The day dawned misty and cool, I remember that.  All was going according to plan, when a chilling sound rang out from but a short distance away.  It was the low moan of a battle horn, I was to realize later.  I had never heard such an eerie, terrifying sound before.  Then all around me turned to chaos.

A horde of Taathians materialized out of the forest on huge destriers with nostrils flared, wielding  cruel weapons of a sort I'd never seen before.  Their torches blazing, eyes wild with bloodlust, they swept down upon the town and began slashing and burning with great abandon.  Although our warriors fought with great courage, they were no match for the evil force that had descended upon us.  One by one they fell, until there were none left to fight.  I watched in terror as my family's hovel filled with smoke.  It was all was like a horrible dream.  Dazed and disoriented, I somehow found a small crevice in a rock and hid, crying and praying that Sa's might would visit these barbarians and turn them away.

Alas, this was not to be.  I watched, paralyzed with fear as my village was looted and destroyed, my kinsmen brutally murdered.  It seemed the shrieking and cruel laughter would never stop.  In dark hours even today it rings though my head till I can barely endure it.  

After what seemed like hours, I emerged from my spot to look for my family.  What I saw sent a chill through me like no other I've ever felt.   I came upon my mother's broken body lying amid the ashes and debris outside our home.  Beneath her was my dear brother Trist.  He, too, had breathed his last.  She had died trying to save him.  Sick with the sight, I stumbled across the ruined village barely able to see, so aggrieved and terrified was I.  Near the other end of our tiny spot I made yet another horrible discovery:  My father had fallen in the battle as well.  I stroked his head, hoping for a word from him.  He stirred only slightly, his life ebbing from him rapidly.  I leaned my ear close and with his last breath he said to me, "I love ye, Panick.  Never forget it.  Honor Sa. He will prevail."

As a young Drag-al whose family had just been brutally ripped away, this enraged me at first.  How could I honor a god who had forsaken me and all I held dear?  It was beyond me to imagine my father remaining loyal to this Sa!  But my love for my father and family made me resolve to follow his entreaty.  Still kneeling, I begged Sa to show me what to do, for I was but a child.  An odd sensation came over me then, as if a huge pair of arms had enfolded me.  "All are children," a deep quiet voice said.  "Ye are smaller than most, but I shall care for ye."  Unconvinced, I railed at Sa, flailing my arms and weeping at my misfortune.  "Why, why?" I cried.  "Why did ye let this happen?"  The voice replied, "It is Taath that caused this, and he shall be reckoned with another day."

As I closed my father's eyes for the last time, I reached into his pocket and took his blue lapis pipe for a remembrance, for there was nothing else left.  Fingering its intricate carvings, I wondered what would become of me.  I had heard many stories at his knee as he smoked the pipe.  Perhaps it would keep him near to me.

Completely helpless, I knew not what to do or where to go.  I was utterly alone.  Would that I'd been a bit older so I could have left that place and made my way to distant relatives.  As it was, I wandered around in the ashes and devastation crying for my family and friends, knowing my life, if I were to survive, would never be the same.

Suddenly I heard the sound of a destrier smashing its way through the woods.  Terrified, I tried to hide before it made the clearing, but this was not to be.  Riding the beast was one of the marauding band, returning for I knew not what.  He leered at me menacingly.  Although I ran from him, he made chase and quickly dispatched me, tossing me roughly upon the back of his steed and taking me away to their accursed camp.  

If I was frightened before, it was nothing compared to the terror that gripped me as I arrived at the Taathian camp.  Loud and arrogant, their victory cries came to my ears as an insult to all I'd known in my short life.  I was tossed off the back of the destrier then, in the center of a circle of my captors.  Appalled, I watched as they sifted through the belongings from my village, too small and weak to exact revenge.  They leered at me and spoke insults, ridiculing my race and appearance.  They dubbed me SheDevil, thinking it an amusing way in which to make sport of my allegiance to Sa.  My feet were hobbled so I could not run, and I was pressed into service as a slave.  

The days blurred into one another as I grew older.  For a short while I found a friend in a young Leuian that had been captured in a raid.  We spoke of many things together and my heart thawed a bit; he was later tortured and killed for sport.  From that point on I resolved never to allow myself the luxury of having a friend again.  The tearing away was much too painful.

My heart became like a stone, hardened against the cruelty that surrounded me.  My life was filled with nothing but grueling servitude to those I despised.  In the beginning I was good for little more than fetching water and feeding the animals.  As I grew older I became adept at many of the necessary skills I felt I would need to survive.  The hobbles finally came off.  I kept my head down and performed my duties during the day, never speaking or looking anyone in the eye.  At night I prayed for guidance.  My hatred for my captors burned inside me, and a plan began to emerge.

Little by little, I managed to lay aside some meager supplies which I hid in a tiny hole in the floor of my quarters.  It was done very gradually, without drawing attention.  This was not particularly difficult, especially if done late at night when the evil ones were unconscious from drink and the embers of the fire were low.  I managed to obtain a bit of hardtack and dried meat, a flint and steel, and most fortunate of all, a blue quartz dirk inadvertently dropped from a bag of loot.  A tiny flame of hope began to burn inside me at the thought of being free from my captors.  The beatings would stop.  My head would stop ringing.  I could be free, and perhaps find some sort of life for myself.  

Thus emboldened, I waited until very late one evening when their disgusting snores could be heard echoing across the square.  Mumbling one last entreaty to Sa, I wrapped my treasures in an old scrap of cloth and crept out, knowing not at all where I'd go or what I'd do when I got there.  It did not matter.  I disappeared without a trace, but not until I quietly released every horse I could find.  I could not ride out on one, since I did not know how I'd feed even myself.  But with luck the beasts would wander off and make pursuit more difficult.

The terrain around the town was rough and difficult to navigate.  With a small compass I was able to make certain I didn't wander in a circle and return to the Taathians.  I pushed my way deeper and deeper into the forest, slowly descending to the lower elevations in an attempt to find someplace safely away from them.  I knew nothing about the lands outside my village.  I trusted all to Sa and the fates.

My plan worked well; I never saw the lawless Taathians again.  But the land was not hospitable to a small Drag-al traveling alone.  I eventually found myself on a vast, barren plain with no idea which way to go.  I wandered about aimlessly for many days, my food dwindling to crumbs.  There was no wood for a fire, no animal to capture for a meal, and I grew very weak.  A chilly wind blew constantly, and I began to grow delusional as my fast lengthened.  Sa was with me then, telling me I would not perish.  In my despair I begged him to let me die.  Surely I had had enough suffering to last a long lifetime; there seemed no reason to go on, no reason to live even a moment longer.

It was then that Sa brought my father to me in a fitful dream.  Clad in all his glorious robes and headdress, my father spoke to me.  He admonished me to stop feeling pity for myself and look to serve the Master.  I was told not to despair, for my services would be of value to Sa.  Weeping tears of joy at the sight of my father, my heart leapt and, for a moment, my soul rejoiced.  A fiery dragon appeared in the eastern sky, and I knew the direction in which I was to travel.

I set off the next day feeling rather curious.  Had it all been a dream?  I could not know for sure.  But I knew I had no better plan, and east I went.  The terrain grew more verdant as I traveled along, and I gathered berries and tender roots to eat.  A tiny brook appeared and I again had fresh water.  I had been in this beautiful land only a couple of days when, settled down at camp one evening, a visitor came calling.  

I'm afraid I was not a hospitable Drag-al to the stranger.  Upon hearing someone creeping up to my camp I leapt up and hid behind a rock, dirk readied.  Ironically, having seen many throats slit by the Taathians, I was prepared to do the same to this intruder.  From behind a tree emerged a being unlike any I'd ever seen.  He was old and stocky as a tree, with a huge white beard that nearly covered his entire front.  His skin was tinged blue, his gnarled fingers held tightly to an intricately carved walking stick.  He wasn't much taller than I.  Instinctively I felt drawn to his kind countenance; an aura of peace and serenity emanated from him, unlike anything I'd felt since the days with my family.  Perhaps because I was so frightened and lonely, I revealed myself to him.  

"Who are ye?" I managed to stammer, "and WHAT are ye?"  (I could not be sure he wasn't made of ether and yet another vision!)  Smiling warmly, he looked at me for what seemed like an eternity before he spoke.  "I am Krollan, and I am Hithual.  Ye are Drag-al and not very old, from what I can see...."  "Yes, I replied, 'tis truth."  Krollan, to his credit, did not immediately press me for details, but invited me to his home for a good meal.  My defenses had fallen.  For the first time in many years, kindness was offered to me.  I agreed to go with him and he led me away.

I do not know why, but he took me in and gently nursed my spirit back to health.  Little by little the horrid past was replaced with laughter and kindness.  The mirthful Drag-al inside me slowly began to emerge.  I suspect Krollan eventually began to believe he had created a monster after some of the practical jokes he had to endure.  I will always fondly remember him, and would have stayed with this kind hermit forever, so happy was I to have found such warmth.  He spoke to me of many things, as he was wizened and had seen much in his long life.  Krollan became like a grandfather to me.  I grew strong and sure under his care, and wished for nothing more than to serve him as he lived out his days.  He lived at the foot of a mountain as I had; it seemed as close to a home as I'd ever find.  

But Sa in his wisdom had other, larger plans for me, and it was after several months that he visited me once again.  "Now ye are strong," he said.  "Now ye must cross the land to the north and travel to Spur, where others who follow me reside.  I shall not leave ye, nor have I all these years.  Go now, for your life awaits ye there."

I told Krollan of my vision.  He nodded sagely and, though he was not a follower of Sa, placed great import upon such visitations.  I was to spend another day making ready and we'd sit for the last time together over evening repast.  Next day I set out for the north and whatever it might hold, tears in my eyes, alone once again.  Yet it was not the feeling of desolation I'd known for all those horrible years.  I knew, somehow, that all would be well.

My journey was long and hard, but not terribly eventful; I was attacked once, by bandits lurking in a deep draw.  I managed to best them, but almost completely by accident.  I had fought them off with my dirk until two of them grabbed me and held me down on the ground.  Completely by instinct, I breathed a spout of fire on them and singed them handily!   I had not remembered fire breathing prior to that moment.  Thankfully they were as surprised as I and ran shrieking into the countryside.  

Chuckling at my good fortune, I began to grow more and more curious about this place called Spur, and eventually wandered up the main road into the Town Square.  I was amazed to find a place filled with creatures of every type, most of which I'd never seen nor heard of.  Some were kind, others not so kind, but this was not a lawless place and I felt safe at last.  

I am but a simple Drag-al, and that is most of my story.  I have traveled the Spur for quite a long time now, gaining friends but keeping a distance, always alone, always in service to Sa.  It has given me great joy to be able to help the weak, as I know too well the despair of helplessness.  This life has suited me well, though my heart of hearts seemed destined to remain closed forever.  There was simply too much sadness inside it to ever share with anyone.  It was too painful to contemplate.  

Ye may know that today I am no longer alone, and it is due to yet another Hithual.  Evidently I was destined to be blessed by an alliance with their noble race by powers greater than my own.  I met the Hithual Armonius shortly after my arrival in Spur, but only in passing.  He was in training to be a great warrior and I had my duties to perform under Sa's tutelage.  Although he and I spoke briefly, I found myself embarassed and uncomfortable, for Armonius' gaze seemed to cut right through me.  I heard a strange voice inside my head say "he will remember ye."  I redoubled my efforts for my master then, and saw him very rarely.  I had but one goal, and was well on the way to becoming a devoted sword cleric.

When my skills had advanced sufficiently and I could travel alone, I began hunting assassins and wraiths.  It was then that I again ran across Armonius, skillfully pointing his finger and turning the undead.  He was kind to me, which still was difficult for one so closed as I.  Although I resisted, he slowly gained my trust and we grew closer.  He told me he wished a bond with me.  I could only flail wildly and shriek at the idea!  Sitting in temple I asked Sa what I was supposed to do.  "Follow your heart, Little One" was all he'd say.  (I can nearly swear I heard him smirking...)  

Had Armonius been anything but a dogged Hithual he'd never have succeeded.  It was he that encouraged these details out of me, urged me to write them so some record of my family would remain beyond my time.  I have been richly blessed, for I now have a mate who has thawed my heart and made me part of his family.  I hope someday to find other traces of my kin, but absent that, I shall live out my life here with my friends and adopted family, in service to Sa and his followers.  I still have the lapis pipe from my father, and once again it waves around the fire as stories are told.  Surely, this is what he would have wanted.

A Newbie Guide for Psycians
by Milanden Sa'Kar

1.  We are psycians and we are the most intelligent mortals in Spur, regardless of what the Gemheads say.
2.  The powers of are mind are to be controlled and used wisely.  We look at situations wisely and calmly...unless the situation involves a gemhead.
3.  Respect the Master Psycians for the power of their minds are what you strive your mind to become.

Now, with those simple guidelines, let's go ahead and lay out a basic outline to follow while composing a psycian:

1.  Before entering the world, try to get your psi points to 40 points or higher.  The more psi points you have, the easier it will be to gain levels.  A good way to to start out with good psi points is to not roll to gain every stat to be maxxed at start.  Try to focus mainly on Wisdom, Intelligence, and Will power.  Some say that a stat at "awful" in one of the minor stats(charisma probably) will cause a hidden stat that controls how many psi points you have to be very high.

2.  Since psycians have very low hit points, also try to roll your constitution at "good."  This makes your max hit points to 126.  This will give you a chance of withstanding two really good hits by some of the big guys.

3.  NEVER GIVE UP! If you keep rolling psycians wih psi points under 25, don't get discouraged.  Just be patient(as we always are), and you'll have a good psycian to start out with.

Next, we come to professions:

Runemage- Good for starting.  Make sure you hunt in groups through your beginning stages.  I suggest concentrating solely on Channeling and psionics.  When you hunt, save your money for your training.  You should gain levels pretty fast.  At higher levels, with the current lack of making good money, you'll have a target on your head and get swatted by everyone at the games.  Good example of excellent runemages: Sordum and Marakos.  Both are feared in the Governor Games and are highly respected.

Cleric- Sword clerics- Wonderful for those that want to swing a sword, use psionics, and laying of hands.  One of the most powerful professions with any race, psycians have the added bonus of confusing the opponent then swinging a good weapon at them.  Good example of excellent sword clerics: Viderien and Zykil.

Heart Clerics- For those that like the healing aspect, as well as some offensive spells and divine intervention.  Not many psycians follow this path anymore due to recent changes.  Good example of excellent Heart Clerics: VideriAn and Milanden.

Hand Clerics- From my point of view, one of the best professions for psycians, yet the slowest in gaining of levels.  Unlike leuians, psycians don't get really good DR until they hit the mid 10's in Martial arts.  Yet, when they reach high levels, they are near impossible to hit, and psycians can confuse and bolt to their own delight.  Good example of an excellent hand cleric: None at the moment until a certain psycian returns. :)

Fighter- Wonderful if you'd like to get really high in the fighter's guild.  Not only do you get rank points for essentially every skill that a normal fighter has, you also get rank points for psionics.  This is one of the professions I often pondered becoming when I first started out because of the potential.  Excellent example of Fighters: None.

Barbarian- Same as fighter except for the psionics ranking, yet no examples either.
Forester- Not a preferred profession in any race.  The cons still outweigh the pros for this profession.

Thief- Due to recent changes, this profession is on the up and coming for all psycians.  Because of their ability to disguise themselves, as well as a better chance of stealth, hiding, pickpocketing, etc., I'm expecting this profession to get a sudden surge in psycians, much to the psycian society's dismay.  Good example of thieves: None.
Bards- Unpickable, neither pros or cons.

A Dragon's Tale

It is very sad to see your parents die.  When you're young, it does crazy things to your mind.  I have a good reason to know.  I had spent my childhood stalking innocents and murdering them.  I felt that everyone, everywhere, was out to get me.  It was very frightening.  Due to a few anonymous people's questions, I decided to try to have a few days of my life in my disrupted state published.

This first day took place in an area not far from the training grounds.  I remember I had just shoplifted a dagger from the merchant there.  I was very dangerous to people who hadn't had time to mature, and I apoligize to them now that I finally see the folly of my ways.  I had been stalking a flerian forester while hidden in the shadows.  I felt unbelievable amounts of hatred as I followed that unarmed flerian into some forested areas.  I struck!  The next thing I knew I heard a little squeak as I drove my black vanadium dagger into the back of the little flerian.  I felt its body jolt in surprise.  After watching it twitch for a few seconds, I pulled the dagger out of its back and watched it fall to the ground, lifeless (I shudder at the thought of this as I write it.)  After laughing at my defenseless victom for a few seconds, I left it there to rot.  Shortly after that, I came to an obsidian gate full of people.  I selected my victim: a psycian equipped only with a light bark training armor.  I jumped into the shadows and followed in through the gate.  After waiting for it to kill a shade with it's psi-powers, I threw my knife.  I don't remember seeing it hit, I just remember blood splurting from the head of that psycian and it stumbling and falling on the ground.  I watched it suffer and laughed at its many attempts to pull the knife from its head, and then it stopped moving.  I wasn't satified.  I pulled the knife out and decapitated the lifeless body.  Then I took the shade's chest and walked away, satisfied for that day.

In this next day I write about, I was still in the TG and the area immediately around it.  Keep in mind I was able to kill these people because the boundries in TG didn't have the no PvP field that it has now.  Or, at least I hear there is one.... anyway, I was hiding behind some plants in the bank.  I heard the little voices in my head, but I didn't feel I could trust them, thinking they would turn on me.  The more I thought of those voices in my head trying to decieve me the angrier I got.  I felt my body heat rise as I suddenly flared up in intense rage.  I pulled the iron saber out of it's sheathe shakily, waiting for my next victim.  When a frontacian walked into the bank, I literally dragged it out and threw it on the ground.  Before it could do anything, I drove the saber into its chest.  I waited for the blood to splurt out and then I lifted it up by the shoulders.  I stuck the end of my saber, which was sticking out of his back, into the wall of the bank and watched him dangle.  Then I did something really gruesome.  I grabbed it by the feet and pulled down until the head was split in half and it fell lifelessly to the ground.  This was the day I found out about the secret cellar in the basement of the inn.  I remember dragging a hithual in there, bound and gagged, to the secret cellar.  I took one of the torches off of him that he was carrying for no good reason and lit it, then I dropped it at his feet, burning them.  I smiled as I watched him screaming for help and laughed when he eventually choked to death on the smoke from the torch.  By the end of the day, I had added a leuian and a monit's body into that cellar.

Then came the day I met my best friend, the one who cured of my mental... eternal suffering.  Bizzy had started talking to me on the link, but I was sure it was a trap and didn't answer back.  After much persistance, he had finally convinced me to see if it was possible that I could have him as a friend.  Me an' Biz became best friends and after spending a long time around him, I started to calm down.  He told me not to kill anyone while I was around him and I couldn't stand being so lonely, now knowing what it was like to have a friend, so I had to stop killing.  After I got used to the idea of being good, I realized how terrible I had been and decided to spend the rest of my life keeping others from feeling the hate and pain that I felt for so long.  The best way I could achieve this was to become a comedian dragon.  I'm just glad that biz was there for me when no one else could reach me, or I'd be tormenting people now..... thanks, biz

More from Emblem

You find a tattered parchment on the ground.  Curious of what it has to say, you slowly pick it up and open it, careful not to rip the hardened and thin material that it was made of.  Inside, you find the writing of ancient times.  It has been signed by Emiarlyah and Trivasiel Powerstryke, who you recognize immediately as Emblem Powerstryke's parents.  Feeling compelled to go on, you read:

Many have thought us unusual for spending so much time in our research and observation.  This time hasn't been in vain, despite many people's thoughts.  We have recorded some of the theories and facts that we've come up with.  We have come up with reasons or theories for the existence of some of the races that exist in the spur, we'll list those first.  Please remember that we know our theories do not concur with the research that was made before ours, but we feel we have found the real reasons, so please keep a somewhat open mind while you read this, and do not try to immediately shoot us down.

Anthians:  Anthians seem to have the ability to speak in the common language of the spur, as well as the chirps and squeaks of birds, and they have a physical resemblance of lizard-like creatures.  Because of this we started our research out with a magically enhanced visual aid to confirm that their DNA was similar to those of the races I stated.  With this we hypothesize that they have either been created or evolved after these earlier, simpler races.  After strenuous research and experimentation, we have come up with the theory that Anthians were genetically created into a semi-primitive race, due to lack of knowledge.  We have found that the anthians' DNA looks as if all of the rough cracks have been smoothed out because of their ability to rapidly evolve.  It is not unlike that of the human's ability.  This was our final theory of the anthians, though this hasn't been proved, and contradicts many other theories of different scholars of other races:  They were made with the general goal of being hard workers, flyers, and superior scouts.  It seems that the DNA stacker (a lament term we use for those that arrange DNA that we don't know the identification of) had seen the superior abilities of these different species and tried to put them together to make the ultimate companions for some purpose..... which we haven't determined yet.  We think that it may have been done in anticipation to a battle when the DNA stacker's allies wanted to tip the battle into their favor, but we haven't found anything proving that guess.  It seems after their purpose was served, the DNA stacker sent them off on their own to evolve.  That is all we've uncovered on anthians as of the current date.

Arachnians:  It seems that this race has changed greatly since its beginning.  Research and magical remote viewing has uncovered that this race was once as magically apt as usil elves, strong as monitanians, peaceful as secians, and spoke in the spur's common language, as well as their own.  They seemed to be a flawless and perfect race, until the day when their ruler was abducted and toyed with mentally by a hostile race, we don't know who as of now.  This ruler came back corrupt, but it wasn't visible and he was greeted happily back and given the throne back when he was returned.  In his corrupt mind, he was paranoid, thinking that all of the other races were against him and must be controlled.  No other arach had been exposed to such thinking before this one as they were as loved as secians at the time.  This bad fruit in the barrel quickly spread the desease it carried until every arachnian was corrupt, bloodthirsty, chaotic.  They had the ability to web, cast superior magic, and such superior strength that all who they faced were conquered quite easily.  This all changed when they attacked the frontacians, who were the most magically advanced race that existed then.  A group of the most famous and powerful mages, alchemists, and necromancers joined together and combined their magic to form unmagic, a force that defied time and space... and existence itself.  This powerful entity was sent toward the arachnian tribe, making them magically disabled.  The force was a two edged sword, though, and was bounced off the arachnians, so to speak, and came back with the same force at the master mages and necromancers of the frontacian race, mutating them into crystallized beings.  The arachnians, and their twisted, paranoid view, has made them hate every existing race up to date.  They were not as much of a threat, because of their magic handy cap, and were defeated time after time by all of the other races they tried to conquer, and they decided to wait back and gain in their skills and knowledge, and to adapt to their handy cap, before they would continue to conquer.  The arachnian section was proven to be fact, not theory, by our research.

Dragons:  We feel that we will be biased in this report so we'll try to state the facts and have as little input as possible.  The dragons were a long ancient race that lived on our... their land, or continent, rather.  Ever since the beginning, dragons have had the ability to use magic and weapons alike.  Dragons evolve naturally at a super fast rate.  In fact, they evolve many times in one lifetime.  The drawback of the dragon race is that they all have to start out in their basic, unevolved state, and each has to evolve separately, again and again, over and over.  If this weren't the case, we think they would even be able to question the authority of the elders, as of every other race (but then again, our natural bias....)  Thinking this made us come to a realization, which we changed into hypothesis, which later was upgraded to theory.  We believe that the elders, wanting to keep their authority, and knowing that the ecological thinking of dragons wouldn't get their job done (we would replace them someday if it went on like this, and they knew) they altered our genes to repeat the cycle over and over, so we wouldn't bring the spur to a ruin, not for personal reasons (well, for a couple personal reasons, but others as well.)  Elders have always envied the dragons ability to evolve, but they couldn't alter themselves to do the same because that would mean they would get older, meaning that they might die eventually, which they refused and still refuse to let happen.  That is all we can make public on our report on the dragons, since we have many secrets that we can't afford to lose, or to hint toward.

Elves:  Once, long ago, elves all were one race.  Then the fateful day came when the land became angry at them for using its trees for arrows and such despite its warnings not to, and made a powerful earthquake.  The earthquake separated the elves into three different groups.  Two of the groups were separated from the trees that were their home, and went their separate ways.  The fir elves, the ones that were in the trees after the incident, became very forest aware and nature friendly in fear that the land would separate again, making them lose loved ones and friends.  The usil elves decided to make themselves not so much of an easy target, and not being super strong, studied in the ways of magic, hating the fir elves because of their jealousy and the san elves because of their cruelty.  The third group of elves was so mad at the land, it took over their whole essence and they became, cruel, evil elves.  The three group of elves didn't have contact with each other for many generations, and forgot about each other.  They all went their separate ways and then all three eventually migrated to the spur, where they try to avoid or kill each other whenever possible.

Drag-als:  These little guys were developed by the monitanians, who were trying to make figures in their likeness using their own DNA.  The drag-al were ridiculed by their creators for being so short and eventually made their way to the land that they resided on for many generations.  That is all we've uncovered so far on drag-als, as we haven't focused on them as much as some of the other races in our research.

Leuians:  Like the arachnians, the leuians weren't once battle corrupted.  Their only goal was to be allies with every other race that was out there, and so they made a standard to live up to so the other races would accept them.  They made a group of prestigious leuians and called them the pride, making the example for the younger or off track leuians.  Leuian thieves were looked upon very negatively and were often executed.  After the old ruler died, the next in line was more lenient, and the next was even more, until the thought of being friendly disappeared and all that remained was the idea of courage of honor.  They developed the idea that it was okay to fight to uphold that honor, and fighting itself eventually became honor in their eyes, shortening their temper and forcing the less prestigious family lines to become killing machines to get their honor by fighting.  This is what they are like now, and they had a pretty simple past.

Penthanians:  These are the crystalline people that used the unmagic force to seriously handicap the arachnian clan.  They were welcomed to stay with the frontacians, but the pain of them being so different and their jealousy forced them to move away.  They continued to strengthen their magic in case if ever needed to be used and hid from other races at first, ashamed of their appearances.  After awhile, they opened up and a few moved to the spur, where they reside now.

Frontacians:  This race has a long, complex history.  They were once the ruler of the land, before the elders existed.  The elders felt that they were too communistic with their governing and decided to punish them by taking the crown from them and changing their DNA, so they were in constant need of a rare, expensive drug in order to survive.  Because of the amazingly slow evolving rate of Frontacians, this has been temporarily fixed but there will be a day when it will be back to what it was.

Psycians:  These were once an emotionless, stone cold race.  After the frontacians were taken over and their DNA was disrupted, they knew they didn't want to suffer that fate alone and chose the psycians to be the victims of their vengeance.  They got together and cast a spell on the unsuspecting psycians, making their mental chemicals out of whack.  The psycians quickly developed a cure, which the merchants sold at an accelerated price because of greed.  For a long time, the only emotions they had were greed and hate, until they realized that the chemical imbalance wasn't so critical when they were happy.  So they all changed themselves to be happy after they got revenge on the frontacians by hiding in the shadows and psychologically bolting them.  Ever since then the psycian's emotions were enhanced passed most other races and their hate toward the frontacians for disrupting their peace remains uncanny.

Hithuals:  These are a people that haven't been influenced by the outside world and dwelled in their many tunnels and labyrinths.  The hithuals had used their time perfecting their forging ability to make tools to harvest minerals and dig tunnels.  After they were attacked by the arachnians who were magically handicapped, they used their ability to make awesomely forged weapons and fought them off easily.  They realized their forging ability was superior and happily joined a giant trade system, selling their weapons and buying things from other races.

Oog-ras:  Oog-ras were created by frontacians when the frontacians realized that they were strong mentally but they would need some brute strength at times, too.  They made the oog-ras too dumb to disobey, so they could order them around.  The oog-ras were too dumb to do most of the tasks the frontacians required of them and were abandoned in the frozen wastelands.  The oog-ras followed their food to the spur, where they stay.

Thugians:  Thugians were naturally barbaric and formed tribes to go kill other races.  The races all thought the thugians were a nuisance and made them completely void of any intelligence to stop them from pestering everyone.  It worked.....

Alarians:  This race has been so discreet, we don't even know if they exist.  We didn't get any information on them.

Flerians and Go-Blin(-al:) These races worked together along with flerians as slaves for the Elders.  The flerians and go-blin and go-blin-al all tried to escape.  The flerians got away and started a new life with thieves, foresters, fighters, and runemages.  The go-blin and go-blin-al got caught and were punished by being turned into repulsive creatures.  After the elders no longer required their services, they let the distorted creatures go.

Elders:  This race of beings is very hard to get close enough to study.  We plan to go to elderia to study them more closely in the near future

Muatana-al:  This mysterious race isn't near as brutal as people think.  They simply take our life essence to life, but they are actually a very culturally advanced race and are very civilized.  It's a pity that they have such a bad quality about them, they would make great friends otherwise....

Secians:  We think that secians and dragons share such a bond because we once were exactly the same: mentally, emotionally......all but physically.  Secians lived on the distant land of secia free from hatred.  Unlike the other races, this hatred free environment was never disrupted with hatred, and the secians grew up next to where the dragons lived and they developed a strong bond..... that is all we can release to the general audience.

Monitanians:  This is a race of lizard like men who's history was not unlike that of hithuals.  They weren't even aware that other races existed until they were attacked.  In the middle of the attack, they wanted to make a race in their likeness, turning the battle in their favor.  They were so dumb that they made the race too small and sent them away because they were repulsed by them.

On a personal level, Emblem has been born recently, and we haven't had much time lately to study as we have had to take care of him.  We apologize for having incomplete theories in some of our answers because of this.  We plan to take him with us to elderia and are very exited of how he will turn out.

Secian Sticks: 

In the eternal search for various instruments to aid in the Secian dream of life, liberty, and the pursuit of gems, the hard working Secians of Secian Stuff Corporation have came up with the latest. The Secian Sticks is a series of magickal items that are intended to help in the many tasks Seciankind face on a day-to-day basis. 

The actual construction of Secian Stick merchandise is a highly guarded secret, and Secia Magickal Item Construction Regulations (SMICR) (Paragraph: 10, subparagraph: 14, line: 2.) require that the construction and importation of 'Stick' Class items be limited to Secia. 

With that said, it is a hard task to find a Stick class item within even the limits of Secia. Each Stick class item must go through over 1000 hours of (wo)man labor and magickal rituals before it can be released into the market. Knowing the working habits of Secians, that is limited to one of each kind a year. 

After construction and trial whacking of said stick over heads to see if it produces desired effect, it can be released into the common market.  Prices typically range for over 2000k silver. Or one diamond and a tickle. 

Also following with SMICR no Stick class item may inflict any harm, as one of the magickal enchantments renders it harmless; it may not be used in melee combat. Any whacking or prodding with a Stick class item will cause no pain or damage. 

Thank you for shopping with Secian Stuff incorporated.  The summer year 304 catalog is below.  Please remember our motto: If you can't beat it, tickle it senseless! 

Stick Catalog!

Are you looking for that extra length in your tickles? You need something you can giggle at relentlessly? How about something to sort what is a Glass Gem and what's a Diamond? Well now you can!  With the new season of Secian Sticks comes a new utility. You may place an order by sending a scroll or just yourself to our home office. 

All Sticks can be made to effect Omnipotent beings (sometimes referred to as Guides and Elders in those wacky frontier cites) for 150% extra.  And, a year's worth of custom attunning to the magickal enchantment. Some Sticks require attunation for work, and for others it is optional. Attunation magicks may be laid in advanced, and will instantly be attuned to the next person that touches it. 

Tickleing Stick: An tried and trusted module since our first creations of the Sticks. The Tickleing Stick hits a new height this season with the new 3 foot models! That's right, tickle your favorite thing from two Secians Lengths away! Available by special order with attunation or local Secia Magickal retailer...

Dragon Tickleing Stick: The hot ticket from last year comes back with a vengeance! 2 foot modules only. Specialty enchanted tip tickles through both armour and scale! A must have for any Dragon Lover. Available by special order or local Dragon Supply Centers.

Gem Stick: Newest design in the Stick series. This 1 foot rod looks like a normal shaft of wood. But as it's slightly pointed end is pointed at a gem, it gives you a tickling feeling equal to the value of the gem. Glass gems are worth a scratch, and large diamonds have you in convulsions. Available by special order with attunation or from your local Jewelry dealer.

Big Pointy Stick: Another olde but goodie. Despite the name this does not inflict harm, however when you prod someone with it, they are magickally forced to tell an truth or cute story. Both versions are 2 1/2 feet poles. Attunation is required, and this item is restricted to Secia officials.

Sticky Stick: Another new design by us. This "stick" is actually made so that it can retract and expand (magickally, of course) from 6 inch carrying to 7 feet max. Point is enchanted to stick to whatever surface it contacts as long as the handle is held tight. Available by special order or in general stores. 

Super Stick: A clerical aid for those Secians who just want to heal! Not only is this stylish 1 foot stave a gift from your deity in style, but with it's unlimited supply of Vigor, Heal, Detoxic, and other healing spells make it the prime of healing utility! Attunation required, and item is available by special order or in health stores. 

Happy Stick: Another well traversed design back better then ever. With a good 1'6" shaft, this stick will, when it is touched on someone, give an insane amount of happiness, joy, and all in all spiffyness in both toucher and touchie. Available by special order with attunation or in general stores.

Role Playing Stick: The ultimate creation of the Stick items. This has the power to return proper order to all that are whacked with it. If any race or class is talking about dark magick such as "Foot Ball" or "Microwaves" a single whack of this stick will return them to proper order of talking about Magick and Dragons! Available by special order only.

Note-Experiments into more powerful forms of this Stick is manifested in the Bally Class Stick prototype. Only one is in existence and is rumored to be in the hands of a Secian in the local Spur area. Big rewards are posted to the person that presents the Bally Stick to a Secian Stuff research facility.

PepPoem

In the absence of caring comes nothing but strife,
In the absence of loving, you cannot find life.
In the absence of dreaming , the nightmares arrive
In the dark of the night there is nowhere to hide.

In the shadows of twilight the emptiness lurks,
Upon scanning the depths I found nothing but hurt;
Redemption in grief was the soul of my search
But the source, when I found it, would not speak a word.

When the warmth fled away I thought I'd survive still
Sufficient enough was my heart's bitter chill-
But fleetingly past went the cruel frozen thrill
And when blizzards have ended, the frost can yet kill.

When the light fled away I was left all alone,
Only then did I realize my hopes were long gone
I was dying; the solitude turned me to stone
I forgot how to laugh, to weep- how to go on.

In the absence of caring came infinite strife,
In the absence of loving, I gave up my life.
In the absence of dreaming the nightmares arrived,
In the absence of feeling, the pain came alive.

ABSOLUTELY NOTHING, by Rhea Romero

Her name was Narha, and therein lay the root of the problem.

You see, "Narha" in Anthian means absolutely nothing.  Which is odd, because most Anthian names are derived from some root or another:  such as rhe, "excruciatingly, stunningly beautiful," or gust, "delicate and ladylike."  So clearly there was something strange about this Narha person.

She had the habit of peering at everything, which some people found rather
disconcerting.  She rarely blinked.  Her wings were obviously too small to support her
weight, and indeed no one ever saw her fly.  Her class was unknown, she followed no
god, her mood was always unconcerned and her features were plain.  Narha was a
member of no guild, had no family or friends, and was never seen to train in anything. 
Nothing about her was in any way traceable.  People would see her and forget about her.  

But Narha never forgot a face or name.  In her remarkable and un-Anthian-like memory, she stored every detail of life she saw.  She knew the life stories of exactly 78 Spurians, and the number grew every day.  As soon as she met a person, she would set a memory tag on them, and next time she saw them she would store relevant information under their name.

All this was creepy in and of itself, until it was discovered by someone or other that
"Narha" was not this person's only name.  Nor was she always an Anthian, or always
female.  And she wasn't just memorizing lives.  She was manipulating them.

A word of advice here.  A quiet comment there.  An affair, a dispute, a spar gone wrong, a theft, a hunt into uncharted territory, an exposure of some unfortunate incident.  An unsigned message in the post office.  Small and large events combined, and it was clear that those 78 lives had been expertly changed by Narha, or one of her incarnations.  That she was gently sculpting Spur and its people to fit her tastes.

But don't get paranoid or anything.

A Thieves Perspective

A Thieves Perspective - September 1, 1997-September 15, 1997

Sucks to be innocent...
After killing Vrilkyn the bardic peddler 4 times and stealing 3.5 million silvers and an expensive instrument, Melraath Silentpaw was rules justified in both the killings and stealing of the lyre.  Punishment for his innocent verdict consisted of 10 days in jail and a 1.1 million silver fine.  At the same time, Vrilkyn was hitching up his wagon to leave the Spur because of lack of justice.  After seeing the stiff punishment for being -innocent- he decided to stay.  One source was quoted as saying "I don't think there's any possibility that the verdict was intended for the sole purpose of keeping Vrilkyn in Spur.  Its obvious that the trial wasn't just for show."

The captain jumps ship...
The intrepid adventurer's traveling to find the key to entering the archdemons hellish plane thingie have all returned to the Spur with the aid of their gods sanctuary after discovering that the captain and crew of the ship jumped overboard several days ago.  Said one traveler "I had been wondering why we had been sailing in a tight circle for 3 days!"

Bards become beggars...
ChibiChibi (esper512), in hopes of resurrecting the bard recitals has requested donations of clothes, money, familiar collars, gems, weapons, armor, and alcohol for winners prizes.  ChibiChibi hopes to offer improved prizes in order to draw more people to the competition.  Even if only a few people show, at least we can all get totally blitzed with the alcohol donations...

Weddings, weddings, weddings...
In the past two weeks the love bug has bitten seemingly most of the Spur.  Roxanne and Slinnky, Varchild and Tscina and Bigflower and Teariel have announced plans to be married.  Xombie and Angelstar tied the knot last Sunday, in a short but interesting ceremony.  Best of luck to all of them, and I certainly hope it lasts...

More news about Vrilkyn...
Before the much hyped trial of Melraath for crimes against Vrilkyn, he sold some very unique items and showed off some even more interesting items and bardic spells.  In his first visit to our unfair city, Vrilkyn sold a Muatana-al weapon, a special potion, and showed off his staff and bardic magic.  The bardic magick is capable of removing peacebond, causing the target to dance, and other interesting effects.  His staff allows the user to scry to anyone in the realms, and the lucky few who have tested it were very impressed.  The Muatana-al blade reportedly drains the target it hits.  It also apparently drains the wielder of the weapon from time to time.  Guess thats what you get for buying a Muat's blade, eh?

A lazy thief...
Those stories I promised from last week have been put off indefinitely.  To be exact, until I get off my ass and work on them.

Wonder

I had a dream last night.  I've had it allot recently. Pretty much the same dream.  I'm trying to walk down a long and rouged path.  The way becomes more difficult and my self-doubt rises.  What is at the end of the path and is it worth it?

The dream always leaves me in a great despair and the need to be without the company of others grew.  I have to leave.  So I gather my few possessions and quietly set off.  I feel certain that few will miss me.

Wondering aimlessly, deep in thought, I lose track of time, direction and terrain.  I realize, with a start, that I am standing before an old, weather beat cabin that's leaning distinctively to one side.  It is clearly not the place of an arachnian and I tend to enjoy only the company my own kind.  But I am somehow drawn to look at the details of the house.

As I look at the cabin a strong feeling rocks my body.  A tear rolls down my check.  I've had this feeling before.  It was during a fight.  Not a small fight.  It wasn't a skirmish.  But upon an immense field with a shallow valley in the middle. Two hoards were facing each other on opposite hills. The hoards so thick and wide it made me feel insignificant.

And then, over the sound of my heart beating, I noticed loud screaming.  Everyone around me was screaming.  I was screaming.  Screams louder then I thought was possible.

Instinctively, I placed my hand upon my sword in its scabbard.  Then I noticed movement on the opposite hill.  Yes, they were coming toward us.  And I was running toward them with my sword at the ready.  The last thought I had, was a curious wondering as to "when did I draw my weapon."

But now was not the time for thoughts.  Now was what the old timers would call the time of rapture, the violently happy feelings that ran through my body.  It was pleasure at its extreme.  Now was the time to let instinct have its hand.  At first the instinct to kill that I'd been training in for so long.  Then it changed.  Maybe it was the sickly sweet smell of the blood or the earth shattering sound coming from all directions, but gradually it turned and evolved into a survival instinct.  To just come out of this alive, if that was at all possible.

There were so many there, then, but now I am so obviously alone; and just within the entrance to the house.  Dang, I don't remember opening the door or even walking to it.  I really hate it when that happens.

Looking around quickly, it is quite clear that who ever lives here are not wealthy people.  The furnishings are sparse and were roughly made with crude tools.  It is the place of people that are living hand to mouth.

But there is no one is sight.

The house consists of one room with a bed in one corner, a place for a fire and cooking utensils in another, a ladder leading up to what must be a small loft, and a table in the middle.

I move to the table, most probably the table where the residents eat their meals.  I can just make out a book sitting upon the table.  I quickly assess the table and determine it to be sturdy enough to support my weight.  I then jump upon it to get a better look at the book.  The tabletop is clean.  Very clean.  Looking around again I realize the whole place is immaculate.  Almost too clean.  For some reason that scares me.

I was mistaken.  It's not a book lying upon the table, but a pile of pages.  "Dang."  What appears to be the title, is written in human.  Yes, I believe its human.

But wait.  Written, in common, as if someone had held the quill in a fist and applied immense pressure as they wrote is: "The Diary of a Crooked Man who lived in a Crooked House."  And just below it was strangely written "tell me now, if you've heard this one."

My ears pick up the sound of human children playing outside and it sends a shiver running down my spine.  I go to the door and look out, but no one is in sight.  Playing the sound back in my head I figure it must have been the sound of the table squeaking under my feet.

Returning to the table I turn the top page aside.  The rest of it is in the form of single sentences per line, almost like a poem.  It reads:
I had me a wife.
I had me some daughters.
I tried so hard; I never knew still waters.
Nothin to eat and nothin to drink.
there's Nothin for a man to do but sit around and think.
Nothin for a man to do but sit around and think.

Well I was a thinkin and a thinkin till there was nothing I ain't thunk.
Breathin in the stink until finally I stunk.
It was at that time I swear I lost my mind.
Started makin plans to kill my own kind.
Yes, that was when I started makin plans to kill my own kind.

"Come little daughter," I said to the youngest one.
Put your coat on, we'll have some fun.
We'll go out to the mountains, the one to explore.
Her face lookin up; I'm standing by the door.
     
Come little daughter, I will carry the lantern.
We'll go out tonight, we'll go to the caverns.
We'll go out tonight, we're goin to the caves.
Kiss your mother goodnight and remember that God saves.
Yes, yes.  Kiss your mother goodnight, remember God saves.

I led her to a hole, a deep black well.
I said "make a wish, make sure and not tell.
Close your eyes, dear, and count to seven.
You know your papa loves you, good children go to heaven.
Know your papa loves you, and good children go to heaven."
     
I gave her a push; I gave her a shove.
I pushed with all my might; I pushed with all my love.
I threw my child into a bottomless pit.
She screamed as she fell but I never heard her hit.
She screamed as she fell but I never heard her hit.

Gather round boys to the tale that I tell.
Do you wanna know a how to take a short trip ta hell.
It's guaranteed to get your own place in hell.
Just take your lovely daughter and push her in the well.
Take your lovely daughter and throw her in the well.

Don't speak to me of lovers with a broken heart.
You wanna know what will really tear you apart.
I'm goin out to the barn where I never stop in pain.
I'm goin out to the barn to hang myself in shame.


I lower myself off of the table and close the door behind me as I leave the cabin.

Spur stands as a memory of its rich past.  Archaic merchants move slowly, reminiscing the bustling Merchant district, the bazaar, the whole living city.  Now, dust quarrel in the wind, arguing silently over the deserted districts.  An old Dragon sits in the shade of the Town Square statue, thinking of when adventurers streamed into Spur, either from foreign lands, or through the Archway that opened to the Town Square itself.  Silver locks hung over her eyes- eyes that once burned of war and destruction, of honor and fire.  She is alone.

The Dragon thinks back.  Spur was once bustling with life.  It did so a point in time in the past.  So long ago, it was almost a tale, except there was no one else to tell the tale to.  She looks up towards the sky, and spanning her wings wide, sailed up on the air currents and looked down on her beloved city.  There were only mindless beings, none with the adventuring spirit of the past.  She would leave the city.  She would be the last to leave this beloved city.

It was all great when life was luxurious and fun.  Adventurers would slaughter assassins and wretches by the dozen, reaping treasure and throwing it all into a night of ale and barbaric party.  And then, slowly but surely, a sickness crept into Spur.  Its very heart was corrupted.  The governor had imposed a tax on all in Spur.  All who crept or flew or thread in Spur would have to pay time-taxxes to the governor.  No one dared to rebel or assassinate this injustice, but took it as a fact of life- political efficacy and disdain for politics prevented any intellectual response from Spurians.  Some Usilins did rebel, but they were quickly and silently put to rest by a couple assassins.  Murmur lingered in the air about the sudden evacuation of Spurians.  Just before the time-taxxes, quick goodbye notes were written, though many people denied that they left because of the time-tax.  Some left due to initiation in their homeland or visiting an exotic far-away land.

Of course, this affected Spur, more so than when SA changed the rules of Magick, or when Taath decided to send smiting agents to Spur.  This was an earthly power that ruled more than a god.  In an instant, Spur metamorphosized into a ghost town.  But it was evident that people were bound to return, and soon, there were few complains against the time-tax, and the people just tried to hunt quickly so as to pay off this heavy taxation.  But these people were different people.  They were not the Anthians or Leuians that we all know- quick to move, their fleet feet carried them quickly over great distances, slow to repond to a greeting or such.  Deaths were resolved in quick departs, rather than waiting for a rezz (ressurection) from a cleric who would probably be too busy to bother.

Her eyes glanced down to the city.  She looked again, blinking her eyes.  Was she mad, or was the city populated again?  She swooped down and saw a group of her bestest friends- all gathered and hunting, chatting and slowly stepping of the ground, enjoying the slow movement of life.  Exotic beasts snarled at them, and tediously, they were eliminated.  The Dragon rejoiced at this dream of the past, made real in the present.

Merchants plodded through the streets of Spur, the greatest city ever.  There, dead on the ground, lay a great Dragon, having more happiness than the archaic city could hold.

Obituaries:

-- Friends, please join us at the House of the Dead for these following funerals:

*** Bone E. Ribbs - found dead in the skeleton closet, apparently fire maced, hit with a hammer, carved up further with a sword, and hacked on by some claws by the miriad of hunters that frequent that place.  He leaves behind his sister Crack Crane Eum, a battle axe, and a pile of dust.

*** Lamp I. Covver - Was almost buried, til this shade came back to life (again).  Enjoyed chasing secians, clawing Khats, and playing hide and go seek with spectres.  Will be remembered by his son Don T. Shyn the shade.  His will would be read, but it seems no one can unlock the chest he carried (::mumbles::).

*** Roguer A. Tief - His Mother, Asking A. Assasoon, claims that this fellow was just wandering some fields near Rehas' tent, when some Leuian tried to pick him.  He had to defend his silver, so he fought back.  Seems the Young Khat, Wat P. Needles, did not know the pouch was trapped, and died also after opening his treasure.  Roguer leaves a steel saber, a (now) untrapped pouch, and a flashy smile.

*** Eye S'ell Tings - A simple merchant found dead south of Town Sqaure.  Seems he muttered the phrase "Be careful, Soros could mistake you for a sheep" to a group of Taathians.  By the time the city guard came to his cries, the poor citizen had been smitten to death.  The guards found that he had been stripped of his weapon and pouch, but had been left with two items.  A wig of wool, and an autographed piece of paper reading Mest and Mel in bloody letters.

*** Ashphalt B. Tinker - This fabulous fixer of items, a Hithie of unparalleled skills, was ran thru with a lance he just fixed.  It seems a certain human got a bit impatient by the LONG lines to see the fixer.  The Human, some lad named Jhered, tested the fixing skills of the Tinker, and found them to be to his satisfaction.  Asphalt is remembered by Basalt, his cousin, and by the Elder Treasury Fund.

*** Shreak N. YuEers - Was in the wrong place at the wrong time.  Seems a certain Dragon and a group of Secians were admiring the wretch establishment, when this lonely banshee tried to speak to one of the lil ones.  Her voice was always a bit scratchy and high pitched, but is that any reason for the Dragon to slice her aorta in an attempt to get to her vocal chords?  She bequeathed her lovely voice to her banshee friend Dame Eugsonic.

*** Nineno Mo - A silly, some say stupid, young Leuian who asked the Noble Jazbo, "what, Khat got your tongue?", while the Montician was in the beserk condition.  And we all know how he loves mammals.  He is remembered by all those new, rash to speak, mammals comin to the Spur, and he leaves behind his skinned hide, which now covers Jaz's mail.  Note: And you thought Jazbo smelled before?

*** Ine Games - A show of power, of all-mighty power, struck this annoying Flerian down.  Seems he practiced the evil art of assiting.  To make in worse, it happened to be a Saturday eve, and the flying one kept asking about some games, over and over.  A single massive paw emerged from the sky in Town Sqaure and raked this Flerian to death.  A cackling voice emerged in all our heads, saying I WILL ANNOUNCE ANYMORE GAMES THIS EVE.  Mr.Games leaves behind his equally stupid cousin, Luv X. Karacter.

That is all for this week, my friends, look for more next week.  If there is one place that is ALWAYS busy in the Spur, tis the House of Death!  Home of the Buy 10 rezzes, get half a dozen for the price of six bargain!

The story of the clan swordstriker

I come from the far north of the great divide. From the clan now called Swordstriker, the only clan in the far north. The Original name of my clan has been long forgotten, but the story of how it came to be, luckily has not. 

After the death of  Balmoran many battles commenced to vanquish the evil knights that remained. One of the great leaders and fighters that emerged in these battles was Swordstriker. Like the original name of my clan, Swordstrikers' name also has been lost in the mist we call time.  After the last of the evil knights was destroyed Swordstriker took a vow never to let the hithual people be enslaved again.  He was not sure what he could or would do to prevent it, until he received a vision.  While in Odarous temple meditating, he received a vision of a snow covered mountain with a rock formation in the shape of a eagle at its summit, some where in the far north.  He knew he and his clan must seek this place ,so he gathered his clan and all others who would follow to go  find this great mountain. He knew when he set out on this journey it would be long and hard, but if he only knew how long and hard.  He had little more to go on than to go north when he left ,but he told his clan that this was all they needed to know ,and Odarous would see them through it.  

Over twenty years past before he found the destination he sought ,and over one third of his followers died on the way. He thought the danger was over and his quest was met ,when he found the mountain.  The caves in this mountain were vast and the valley below contained all the food and game they would need. It seemed a more ideal place could not exist. Until he came in face to face with a mysterious beast we now call amakra that inhabits this particular mountain area.  This creature is more fierce than anything spur has seen. Its color can not be described because it changes to blend in with the environment, it can grow over 60 feet long and has 8 legs. When it attacks it stands up on it four hind legs and attacks with its front four which have poisonous spikes at the tip. Many of the clan were falling victim to this fierce creature ,and it seemed they were going to have to give up their new home ,and Odarous quest.  Until  one night when Swordstriker and a small group of his fighters were standing guard outside a small cave the clan was using. That night they decided to build a fire to keep them warm ,and just after they had the fire started an amakra descended upon the group.  Swordstriker knew his group did not stand  chance against this creature ,so he sent them into the cave while he held it back.  It was an intense battle Swordstriker evaded the creatures blows while returning with blows of his own. The creature finally got the better of him and knocked the sword out of his hand. Swordstriker fell beside the fire and out of desperation picked up one of the flaming sticks and threw it at the creature. It hit the creature and immediately ignited its fur. With in seconds the entire thing was a blazing inferno.  One simple  stick had done what so many of the warriors could not.  The clan now had the key to defeating the amakra.

Swordstriker and his clan set out to reach the summit of  the mountain ,and rid the mountain of the amakra on the way up.  When they reached the peak of the mountain Swordstriker and his clan could not believe what they found.  Just below the great stone eagle was a alter holding  a glowing chest. Swordstriker slowly walked up to the chest and as he reached out to touch the chest the great stone eagle spoke  " you have done well my son ,and for seeking my vision you will be rewarded."  At that moment a flash of light came from the chest and it opened to reveal 12 scrolls.  As Swordstriker  reached for the scrolls the eagle spoke again " This knowledge is not to be used for evil nor is it to be kept solely in you clan."  These were no ordinary scrolls these were scrolls on the art of fighting and Clerical magick written by Odarous himself.   As we all know fighting can not be learned from words alone so after Swordstriker and his clan finished making the mountain home, they began to train in the arts of fighting and magick.  After a warior or cleric was deemed good enough he was sent out to go to the other Hithual clans for forty years and teach them the arts they had learned.  Indead all those who were born into the clan thereafter were required to follow Odarous and be a fighter or sword cleric.  This leads to the story of  how Healinhith of the clan Swordstriker became the only Heart cleric of that clan ever. But that is a story to be told later

Healinhith, Thanks for reading the story

Jazbo: Legend, Myth, Ninny, or Egotist?

In this day of changing time, very few things are constants.  The sun, the rain, gravity, Jazbo the Wonder Poodle. ( I chose to use his true name) Jazbo, Monitanian legend, was born 37 years ago in a swamp. How exciting. As a child he remembers "My friends and I would lay out on the rocks.  After it got too hot, we'd take a nice swim.  But the most fun of all was ambushing little furry swamp mammals.."  This brings up an interesting part of the Jazbo we all know and avoid, err love. His seemingly dislike for mammals as a whole. Now, this is not some cut and dry situation, it is in fact very complex. Jazbo, who has not only a Leuian Brother, Buzzthekiller, but 2 Hithual Parents, Jaymus and Magdyln.  When asked how he can claim a dislike for mammals, when he is so closely connected with some of them, he responded " There are always exceptions, I claim some Mammals just like I refuse to claim certain Reptiles" When asked, do you hate mammals, his response was very interesting, as well as eye opening: " Well, I've got nothing against mammals. I think they're cute in the helpless kind of way.  They get cold and shiver, they get too hot and have heat strokes, and their skin is soft and fleshy."  "The climate may get cold, but my body adapts. Besides, if it gets too cold, I wrap a mammal around me, a dead one of course." Next, when I asked what was his favorite type of mammal, he responded, scaring me. ( this is when I decided we needed a break) " That would be the puppy. They are so tasty when ripe." Yeah, sure, but do you want to tell him he is a sicko? There have been reports of racial slurs being uttered by the common folk of Spur, most know " The weather is only fitting for Monits" . While I find this totally offensive, Jazbo says they are just acnologing their inadequacy in public.  Jazbo also believes that there uselessness isn't really the mammals fault. "When the gods created me they gave me godly STR, WILL, claws, a bite, thick skin, a resistance to psi, a huge amount of carry, and a great lizard personality.  When the gods created the mammals, they granted them the gift of "fluffy" and called it a day."  Some have accused Jazbo, whether or not with backing, that he is an Egotist. With a high level in poles, and most likely the highest Berserk level ever, this might be understandable. Jazbo also believes that his species is in fact the pinnacle of evolution. He now describes his view of the Dragon staging process " They are part of the staging system. Everyone knows a dragon stages 3 times. They are then a 4th stager. 2 years later, they stage again. Then they are an Elder. 5 years after that the Elder will stage. They become a Monitanian." ( Note: in my opinion, Monitanian should be replaced by Anthian, but it's a quote, what are you going to do?"  Jazbo would also like me to mention his current relation with Sonya, congratulations you two, sorry you got the love shaft Sonya. Throughout Spur's history, Jazbo has been responsible for many, many moments. He is usually decked out with finery fitting of a lizard. Peg-leg and all, he has been voted as a champion gladiator, as well as receiving my vote for ugliest person in Spur. Known to play a few ditties on a Wretch instrument once in a while, he has coined the now famous " I eat Mammals", " Mammals are useless", "Where the oliphants and the dead Mammals play" and so on. For a light source, he
prefers a flaming Mammal. During this interview he threatened to kill me if I miss-quoted him. I responded by professing my Reporter Immunity. He said he could beat me to death with my leg and make it look like an accident. The scary thing is, he probably could.  He told me during our much to long interview that he preferred using bite together with a 2 handed pike, giving him a 5 rank, 15 foot range.  Course, if that ever fails, his skill in channeling, is legendary, err unknown. Beware the fire darts, beware. But his love of heavy 2 handed pikes is well known. To use a quote " It's not the size of the lizard, it's the size of his pike" Hmm, truer words have never been spoken. While many believe him to be perhaps untouchable, he always takes time to stop and kill the puppies. Yesterday, speaking with him one south of TS, a Thug came up to us and babbled " It's ou!" He never corrected himself, just shows how excited he was. I started laughing, and he goes, " Don't you know who that is?!?!, That's JAZBO"  I continued laughing, while this person continued to lay praise all over Jazbo.  Throughout it all, Jazbo was polite, and he didn't even kill him once.  This, if you ask me, is restraint.  Last time someone came up to me and started heaping praise on me, my head exploded. Er, rather, if someone ever does, and please do, come up to me and heap praise on me, it will explode.  that isn't really a request, more of a plea.  Anyways, back to topic, Jazbo says that he enjoys the normal life, training hard and listening to the crickets with his mate. Oh, and killing Puppies.  He's told me he has decapitated over 200 of them. According to Jaymus, he also enjoys biting the heads off of baby trolls. Scary, really, really, scary.  He also believes, that while he pities mammals, " they were made to be broken".  About Anthians, he says " I like em until they go past 15 feet" Jazbo does seem, from this writers position, to have small dislike for those he feels are unwilling to kill. But perhaps real power comes from restraint.  For Jazbo's point of view, he said " Exactly.(in response to my asking if my attacking of him would be courage)  You attacking me would show a padload of courage. It would also show alot of blood, but thats beside the point"  Constantly in training, as well as constantly awake, Jazbo has recently become 4th in the Barbarian Guild, which is quite an Accomplishment. When asked if he had any problems with any of Spurs government, he replied that he only recognized the Empress, and that all Elders would become Monitanians in time Any ways, so they didn't bother him with there ideas and changes. In Monitanian society, the females are dominant, just like every other society, they just recognize the fact. On this, Jazbo says " I like it, less work for me"  When asked why he picked the Unknown, as I did, for a god, he responded " Hmm... Searching for the truth"  .  Rather enlightening for a lizard, isn't it?  He did want however, his strength back.  Did anyone else notice that it was gone? ::shudder:: That's like giving Jimbo another Nuke button, like the first wasn't good enough.  Some are probably wondering where I got the nerve to call Jazbo a ninny.  Well, in fact I don't have the nerve, but I can run really, really fast, not to mention my reporter immunity. Yep, I was promised that if I made fun of Jazbo, I'd never feel the repercussions. Of course, this could be because I'm unconscious at the time. So if anyone notices that I'm bleeding profusely, and my leg is lying next to me, blame Jazbo. Just not to his face, cause he'll do it to you...  Maybe not just once, maybe twice. Ok, now for the necessary Newbie help part: Don't name yourself Puppy. Thanks for reading, and remember, there are two published Agents of S.A.N. stories, read them, love them, give me money.

In the basis of language considerations, and the fact I don't speak Monitanian, this
interview was conducted with Chief GoatHammer, Jazbo's unfortunate raven.

The Dragon's Dream

As through many years Dragons work and slay.
Only to dream one dream, to up and fly away.
With claw of might, wings of steel and a heart of pure gold.
Some have staged but yet are not free.
 
As for their wish to gain their ancestoral breath someday
Their dream is to stage to the 4th way.
To end their pain in everyway.
Though the Secians love and with their chosen hearts
 
Dragons' dream is to fly away.
Staying noble though stage 3 and 4.
They try to keep their sainity thoughout the pain
Only to dream one dream of flying away.
 
To fly above the Spur 
To feel the sun on their scales
To try to touch the clouds.
With thier heads held high to the sky, to keep hold of the dream, their dream.
 
To stretch their head, to touch the sky
To spread their wings way out high
Flow their tail throughout the sky
This is the Dragon's dream.

~The Unwritten Poet   ::something whispers "to just fly away"::

"A Visit to The Psychiatric Ward" by Feste Deolivia

Standing hand in hand with his crayon-chomping sister Kyrsten, the fidgeting little Secian Feste Deolivia and his odd sister skipped through a purple striped ruby portal opening in the Priesthood Guild. A strange blue aura suddenly permeated the two Secians' bodies, feeling as if some small creature was crawling up and down their spines poking them with a miniature sword. Realizing it was not a blue aura but actually Mebok the Newt with a toothpick in hand, Feste picked him up, fluttered around the room happily until Mebok turned green again and rolled him up into a ball. Yet, seeing a rip in the blue surrounding, the two Secians fluttered happily and clumsily through, only to find themselves falling into a gigantic vat of yellow Jell-O. As they fell, Kyrsten began screaming, but Feste grinned wide and opened his mouth, plunging into the vat mouth first, devouring the Jell-O left and right. 

After about 10 minutes, the two Secians finally finished the last of the Jell-O in the vat and climbed out. Off to the side of the vat stood a rainbow drathain street sign pointing north-east which the two promptly read. On the sign was what once read: "Spurian Correction Facility" but was crossed out by some weirdo, probably ChibiChibi, and now read: "Spurian Nut Bin." Remembering the words of the dusting Secian Berial, they skipped merrily down the path the sign pointed. Strangely enough, as they walked down the path, they saw what looked to be monkeys hanging from the trees, but in actuality were cross-breeds of a Thugian and an Oog-ra. You know what they would look like, big, strong, hairy, big eyebrows and incredibly stupid. Nevertheless, they swung from the branches freely,  on more than one occasion swinging and bumping into each other. As they approached the huge facility, strewn along the path were some Anthians bopping themselves over the heads with coconuts, Secians talking to gems and the some Penthanians talking to the walls of the facility. Suddenly, from the door of the facility came what looked like the huge facade of a 4th-Stage Dragon carrying a set of bag-pipes.....

The two Secians looked up in astonishment at the 4th-Stage Dragon, especially when he began to play "Hot Cross Buns" on his bag pipes. Then, in a deep, bellowing voice he called out, "Kyrsten! Feste!" Kyrsten slowly raised her right hand, holding a purple crayon in her left hand which held several teeth marks and said hopping up and down, "Here!!" Meanwhile, Feste had climbed up the tail, back and the neck of the 4th-stager and was now sitting on his head. "I'm Here!" He called out excitedly. The 4th-stager then said, "Follow me" and led them into the facility.

Inside, the two stared around in amazement at the size of the place. The room was about as tall as 8 big draggies on top of each other and as wide as 5 on top of each other. Covering the walls were the pictures of the most notorious nuts in Spur, along with degrees certifying mental sanity for all the workers at the facility, although most could be questioned. The 4th-stager then led the two anxious and rambunctious Secians down the hall to show them to their rooms. On the way, they peeked into a couple of the rooms. Surprisingly or not, they saw the Agent of S.A.N. Aubrei the Anthian screaming, "Really! Palladium didn't effect my brain!", Zuril the Dragon yelling, "I may have lost my marbles.... But I found my chainsaw!" and many other familiar faces. The 4th-stager suddenly stopped at Room 314, opened the door and said, "This is your room, in a couple of minutes a nice man will come in and fit you for some coats." At these words, the two Secians hopped up and down in delight and ran into the room as the metal door clanged shut and the 9 clamps on the door were secured. For 5 minutes time, the two Secians bounced off the walls of the padded cell when a Usil Elf accompanied by a Frontacian entered the room carrying two straight jackets. The two Secians jumped up and down screaming, "White Coats!!!!!", pushing each other so they could get theirs put on first. Sneakily, Feste threw Kyrsten's box of crayons into the far corner of the room and the Usil had the jacket put on him first. Kyrsten, realizing that her brother had tricked her whined, grabbed her crayons and ran back to be fitted.

After 2 short days at the facility, the two Secians reluctantly left but were able to sneak their jackets out for souvenirs. The two spent hours of bouncing around in their cells, talking with confused drag-als and eating crayons and Pepperi-mints™ galore and were dispirited to leave. Waving to their friends at the facility, they grinned, stepping through the purple striped ruby portal with straight jackets in hand and arrived once again at the Priesthood Guild and normality of Spur.

The Path of Devotion to Taath

It was a dark and cold night on the 9th day of the 7th month in th year 290. I had just finished a hard days training and was looking forward to a nice peaceful evening filled with some hithual ale til I passed out from fatigue. I sat back and commensed to drinking, no sooner did I finish my 6th mug of ale I fell dead asleep.  I slept peacefully till i felt a cold presence about me and woke immediately to see a form standing before me.  I jumped up and reached for my Double Bladed-Axe, the form began to speak "my son you have been a loving follower of Taath, you have proven yourself loyal and are now given the opportunity to raise your devotional status, do you accept this new challenge and responsibility?"  Kind of nervous I replied yes of course I accept, what is it I must do to prove my loyalty to Taath and raise my standing in my religion?  He looked at me with the most evil grin and said "One week from today you will set forth on a journey to the south where you will come across many different obstacles that stand in your way, these obstacles will not compare to the final battle you must fight, good luck and may your faith be strong enough for you to succeed and survive.  With all that said I began to make arrangements for my great quest.

A few days had passed and I started to get nervous and weiry of what my future had planned for me.  I continued to worry about this all week til the day had finally come for me to finish up my last minute packing and preparing.  I did my normal religious rituals and went to bed.  The night went fast, the light glistening in my eyes forced my awakening, I finally found energy to rise and get ready to go.  My first day was rather cold out and had a dampness in the air.  I traveled for close to 4 hours before I came across a fork in the road, the sign here said "Crystal Lake ->west / Black Forest <-east, I proceeded to the west towards Crystal Lake, not really knowing what way to go I went of intuition.  It started to warm up as the day pressed on.  The foot path that I was walking on suddenly got real thin and went into a these thick dark woods, I thought to myself "hmmm the sign said east was Black Forest."  I decided it to be a good time to draw my weapon and be prepared for whatever lied within the vast forest, It didnt look like the friendliest spot I had ever been to.  I started to approach the mouth of the forest and a sign laying on the ground caught the corner of my eye, I reached down and picked it up to see what it said, the sign read "Black Forest, enter at your own risk."  

I threw the sign down and entered the forest cautiously and waited a few minutes for my eyes to adapt to the dark so I could see what living creatures may lie within.  My eyes adapted quick and I moved on the skinny path that curved through this thick forest.  I saw a something lieing on the ground about twenty five feet in front of me, as I got closer there were alot of bodies laying on the ground, alot of oogra's, thugians, san elfs and arachnians.  I looked them over and noticed all of them bared the mark of Taath.  Suddenly I heard a noise coming from the woods to my right, stood immediately and prepared myself for battle.  I looked long and hard in that direction but saw nothing.  I felt it to be wise to move on and get away from whatever was killing all these followers from taath.  As I moved on I found more and more bodies, but realized not all were followers of Taath.  I continued for about another 5 miles and a form wearing a black cloak with a medallion around its neck approached from the south at a slow pace towards me.  I stopped and stared at the form as it continued to advance me, I finally said "greetins, I am Kryger who are you?"  The form stopped raised his cloak hood off his head, and began waving his hands in the air weaving a spell over his head.  I yelled what are you doing?  Do not attack!  Just then something hit me like like a ton of bricks and seemed to be drawing energy from out of my body, I sat down and treated myself, I stood and charged him, a look of surprise came over his face and he made some gestures with his hands, a black mist surrounded him and when it cleared away he was now a thirteen foot tall black dragon standing before me.  My rage over ran my fear and I commensed to swinging at the dragon with all my energy, the blow was a strong blow to his torso, the dragon growled and clawed at me, teh powerfull claws were parried by my shield but knocked me back, I swung and swung at teh dragon, hitting him in the legs, torso, and arms nearly 30 times, the dragon started casting spells at me, lightning, fire weaves, and webbing were all casted upon me, I resisted fifty percent of them, the others I treated myself and continued to fight.  I finally got an awesome blow to the dragons chest and before I could even blink and eyelash the dragon fell and polymorphed into a black demon with red eyes lying dead on the ground.  

I sat down with a fatigue setting in my body, I rested a little while and moved away from the demon corpse and continued on my way down the skinny path.  Close to two hours or so had passed and in the distance I could see a light at the end of the forest.  I picked up my pace to get out of the dreaded forest.  I got to the point where the end of the forest was a shimmering light that seemed to move in a swirling motion.  I reached out and touched the white light, a tingling went up my arm and I felt my body vaporize.  When I reappeared and opened my eyes I was in a religious room with a huge altar with skull inlays in the urn.  With out a seconds notice a black blur of smoke filled teh room and a form stood there grinning and said "you have done well so far my son but your challenge is far from over, you have chosen the enlightened path of devoted status, before you is your challenge and final stepping stone to become devoted.  There you will face your worst enemy."  The form made a brief gesture and the room was filled with a black mist, when the room cleared out I was standing before a large silvery pool of swirling motions, I looked around and the room is filled with scattered types of weapons and armorments.  I stood there anxiously awaiting to see what was my worst enemy and challenge go to be.  The silvery pool started to ripple and a form stepped out and advanced me, looked featureless as I looked it over carefully.

It reached out and touched me, the second he touched me he started polymorphing and when he was done he looked just like me but with all white on and a goodness aura about him.  He then touched his hand to my chest, it was the most painful thing I had ever felt, with one touch of his hand he sucked all the good I had left in my heart, soul and mind.  As he harnassed this good it seemed to absorb into his Double Bladed-Axe he was carrying.  I was now on my knees from the great pain and looking up at him.  I still was in shock that he was a spitting image of me but had a aura of good about him. He looked down on me and said "lets see what ye got Demon-Boy," I smirked evily and stood up while drawing my weapon with a quickness.  A voice filled the room saying "you must defeat all the good in you to accomplish your devotion."  He looked at me and said "well do ya wanna do that demon-boy, ya wanna destroy all the good in you?"  I was still ticked off from him hurting me from before, I glanced at him and without warning unleashed a flury of attacks on him, my first blow hit him dead in the chest, the very second I hit him a very large gash appeared on my chest and knocked me back, I slashed again hitting him in the head with a powerful blow which knocked him down and left me stumbling back and falling with a gash in the side of my head.  I was starting to see and feel a painful pattern here, although I didnt see any marks on him his life force looked to be getting weaker and weaker.  He lunged at me with a the exact weapon I was using but his glowed with a white arua and hit like a ton of bricks, but the strike did not hurt as much as the burning of good aura he shot into me with his devastating blow.  We exchanged blows for hours but my evil aura seemed to be winning over slowly.  In a last desperate attempt he critical hit me right through my chest with his axe, I saw all the good in my heart, soul and mind enter my body again and try to take over, In a few brief moments that the axe entered my body I was defenseless to this good aura taking over my body, I finally came to my senses and ripped the axe out of my chest.  The second the axe hit the ground the polymorphed form of me and the axe vanished along with all my kindness, love that were in my heart, soul, and mind.  I layed there close to 10 minutes in pain and agony.  I finally opened my eyes and looked at my chest and it seemed to heal right up with out a scratch to be seen.  I made my way up to the altar and kneeled down and prayed, a power I never felt before jolted through me, I heard voices in my head "ye have done well and proved yourself my son, you have earned the right to be a devoted follower under my faith.  I give thee a obsidian sword to weild along with holy symbol with special powers of evil placed in it at your disposal, be well my son and do me proud for I will be watching you closely now."  I stood up put my Taathian holy symbol around my neck, and sheathed the obsidian sword.  A black void opened up before me, I walked into it and found myself in the Taathian temple of Spur.  This is my story of how I became devoted follower of Taath.

Yule Log (Editor's note: heh heh I love it when they don't title their works)

Following is a tale that my cousin, Yulin Rochelet, told to me around the fire of a camp roughly 6 months ago.  I have edited the grammar only to a small degree ( he still has many problems with his common )  so as to keep the rustic feel of the tale alive.  I scribe it now and send it to this fine publication so as others may understand a little better the life of a young fir, as well as give a bit of history on  my dearest cousin.  So please, enjoy…….

I was sent at a young age away from my village of F'ythlinol'Rochin to tutor under the watchful eye of one of the more respected foresters in the region, a fir who was know by the name of D'Shylethinor.  My parents, who I do not even remember anymore, where proud and honored that D'Shylethinor was taking me under his wing.  I barely remember the day I left.  I have not seen them since.

D'Shy ( as he later told me to call him ) was not only my teacher, but he was my father where I no longer seemed to have one, and my closest friend.  After but a short time with him, we were like a family.  Soon, he took another to be his pupil, another fir by the name of Daelith.  Dae became my brother, and we spent much time playing and learning.

The first ten years of my time with D'Shy was spent wandering the forest region just north of the village from which I came.  Dae, D'Shy and I spent much time just wandering the forest, and observing.  Both Dae and I learned much about the home of the Goddess, and the ways of the creatures and plants therein.

What time we did not spend in the forest, we spent in a small shrine in the village of Kalith, a human town that to a young elf seemed large and imposing.  The shirne itself was a small one, and housed only two priests.  It was a nothing more than a small alter in the middle of a clearing, with a small circular wall no more that 3 feet high, constructed out of white stones.  Our time spent there was either in prayer, or study of the Endilinon.

D'Shy and Dae always hurried through the streets, trying to quickly be away from the hustle and bustle of the town streets.  To me, however, I felt at time like getting lost in the hidden beauty of the buildings and its people.  Dae continually asked me why I like to crowds and the noise.   The only answer I could ever give him was that I felt alive among the people.  D'Shy always smiled at this, and said "The Goddess gives to her followers a love of the land.  To most, they love the forest.  To some, they love the people.  Either is acceptable.  It is the people who love no place that are dangerous.  These are the people that try to control, even though they do not love.  So do not chastize your fellow pupil, Daelith.  But rather understand that he loves others as much as you love the trees and birds of the forest."

After Daelith and I had been with D'Shy for a good decade, he brought us to the shrine one day, and sat us both down before the alter.  He then doned his armor, blessed from the Goddess, and pulled two small wrapped bundles from behind the alter, placing them gently before our feet.  

"What ye see before ye is the mark of the Knights.  Wrapped in the skins are Vilythi, yer holy blades.  Gifts from the Goddess, when ye have finished training and honing yer skills.  I place them before ye now so ye can hold them, and know that ye must now prove yer are wothy of them."

Dae and I sat in that small shrine for what must have been a good ten minutes before either of us moved.  Dae was the first to move, slowly unwrapping the skins in front of him to reveal a blade; a most beautiful blade.  The entire weapon seemed made of silver, and the 2' long, curved blade was marked from pommel to tip with writtings and inscriptions.  Upon seeing Dae's blade, I quickly unwrapped mine to see a similar weapon.  It was perfectly balanced, and felt as though it had the weight of a dagger.  Reading the inscriptions, I discovered the blade was covered with scripture from the holy text, along with my name at the base.

"To prove ye have earned these, " D'Shy voice suddenly boomed out, " ye must make a journey now with me.  We must go to the South mountains, and there find a stone which as taken from this shrine and return it.  Ah will go along for guidance, and to help ye familiarize yerselves with yer new weapons.  But when it comes to recovering the stone of the shrine, that ye must do yerselves.   Do ye understand?"

We left the town of Kalith within ten minutes, and were on our journey…..

Our trip took many, many weeks for us to arrive in the vicinity of the stone of the shrine.   D'Shy told us little along the way of the stone.  We were told that a small party of Orcs and Humans had taken away the stone as some sort of threat against the priest of the shrine.  Somehow that shrine protected the village from attacks from the creatures we now faced.   But without that stone, the shrine was not complete, and the protection offered was not as strong.

When we arrived, we stood in a wooded area, hidden behind the foliage, watching the entrance to a cave.  We had spent several days tracking the creatures to this point.  Now we waited in anticipation,  hoping to confirm our suspicions that these indeed were the creatures we had sought.

After several hours of waiting, a couple of creatures stepped out from the cave, and proceeded to sit down and relax.  While they appeared on some sort of watch, they did not seem prepared for what they were about to face.

After a quick discussion, Dae and I decide to let them make the first move, giving them the change to flee, or surrender and turn over the rock.  I prepared myself, and watched as Dae stepped from behind the clearing, and walked towards them.  At first they did not see him, but quickly picked up his movements.  They hoped to their feet, brandishing weapons, a blocked the entrance to the cavern.

"Good day, sirs." Dae greeted them.  "Nice eve, do you not think?"

"What doo youu want, fir.." growled one of the orcs.  "Youu are not welcome here…."

"But dear sir, I am just wandering among the children of the Goddess.  I saw a lovely pine in the distance, and headed this way.  And here it is…"  Dae had started to walk towards a pine near the entrance way.  The guard reacted accordingly.

"STOP!"

Everyone froze, the guards with spears pointed at an unarmed Dae, attention completely upon my brother.

"My dear, friends, this forest is for all to share, and ye have no right to stop me from proceeding to one of the children of the Goddess."

"Iff youu step annnnyyy further, youu will die, elfie……." growled the second Orc.
"Are you threatening me, my friend?" asked Dae.

The second orc snarled again, and said "Yes."  He then raised his spear as if to strike Dae down.  His first mistake.

[Yulin sat back at this point and stared into the heavens for a while.  I can not imagine what he was thinking, although he did have a rather large smile on his face.]

I was ready with my bow.  We had shot animals for food before, as well as much practice.  But nothing like a live foe.  My first shot proved true, smacking the creature right in the middle of the chest.  He staggered back in pain and anguish, as well as surprise.  Two more arrow later, he lay twitching on the ground, his ugly green blood spilling on the ground beneath him.

Dae had engaged the Orc before him, and met with moderate success.  Dae had been poked once in the leg, but had managed a couple of moderate hits to the creature in the abdomen.  About the time I had finished with the first guard, the second realized his predicament, and retreated quickly into the cave.  I cursed, then stood up to charge into the cave after him, when the hand of my mentor stopped me.

"Ye will need this, my young pupil" D'Shy said, as he handed me a lit torch.  I quickly took it, bowed in thanks, and ran towards the entrance.  Dae quickly took the torch so I could continue to use my bow, and we charged into the cave.

The cave went down for several yards.  Exactly how much, I do not know.  My heart was pounding, my blood racing.  The air flowed in and out of my lungs quickly now, as we continued our decent.  Dae looked the same as I, sweat dripping down his face, his Vilythi in hand as he lead.

After several minutes, we stumbled into a cavern, which was lit by a large campfire in the middles.  Several creatures were in the process of standing up and grabbing weapons, and the guard Dae had fought was yelling something to his comrades, point to us.

The melee that ensued is a blur to me now.  I remember firing my bow at a rate I had never imagined before.  I think I wounded at least one creature, while Dae was engaged with a couple others.  I ran out of room and arrow quickly, and drew my own blade to continue the fight.  The fight was over relatively quickly, with us killing two of the creatures and causing a third to run out the tunnel from which we entered.

After wrapping ourselves up ( mostly me wrapping Dae's leg up ), we searched the area and found another, smaller cavern off to one side of the main one.  It was smaller, and had four beds in it.  It was actually furnished with a couple of dressers and tables.  We did not question the wealth of such lowly creatures.  We instead turned the place upside down, eventually finding the stone under one of the beds.

As Dae and I walked out of the cave, we were met with a most disturbing sight.  All around the clearing in front of the Cave lay seven or eight dead orcs, along with two dead goblin-als, and three dead Oog-ra's.  A fourth stood above our master, who was on his knees, bound and gagged.  The Oog-ra was holding an axe above the head of our master.

"Give me white rock, or elf diess" demanded the Oog-ra.

Dae and I were in complete disbelief.  We were not prepared for this, and did not know what to do.  I stood and looked at the scene, frozen, unable to react.  Unfortunately,  Dae was not.

The next scene was like that of a very bad dream gone horribly wrong.  Dae raised his blade above his head, and charged, screaming the name of Elindale above all others.  The axe immediately fell on my master.  I do not think he even knew what hit him.  The creature turned, and attacked my brother.  My instincts took over at that point, and I dropped my bow, drew my own blade, and attacked.

Dae and I were outmatched, and it was readily apparent.  If I had been sane at the time, I would have ran for my life, hoping to outrun the creature.  But neither of us were thinking.  We were only fighting.  And losing.  Badly.

It took only a couple of minutes for the creature to know me out.  I say the flat side of his bloody axe headed for me only in time to raise my blade in defense.   The axe hit my blade, shattering the fine silver, and plowed right through to me, knocking me to the ground and senseless.

I recovered my self and sat up in just a few short moments, just in time to see Dae slice at the Oog-ra's arm and landing a good blow.  The axe fell to the ground and the creature howled in pain, then in anger.  With his good arm, the Oog-ra knocked the blade from my brother's hand, and picked him up by the neck.

"Yous make a big mistake, little elfss.  I like stone, and I keep stone." He growled.   He by this time had Dae in the air, still holding him by his neck.  His back was to me, so I did the only thing I could think to do to the time : I started to slowly reach for the dropped axe not 4 feet out of my reach.  Every so slowly I crept, while the Oog-ra continued to gloat at my brother.  I was when I heard the snap of neck bones that I reached the axe and grabbed it.
I did not even look before I swung, my fury taking over completely.  I swung, and connected with him in some way.  I swung again.  And again.  And again.  I continued swinging for ……. Well, only the gods know how long I did it.  I only noticed it when the clearing was completely quiet, except for my weeping, and the sound of the axe hitting the now very dead Oog-ra.  I collapsed, and basically passed out from shock and exhaustion.

[Yulin again paused at this point, to take a puff on the Long Pipe he carries with him.  You could see the remorse, anger, sadness, and hurt in his eyes, so I waited while he gathered himself to continue.]

It took me a couple of days to bury both of them.  I burned the bodies of the orcs and Oog's.  I buried both Dae and D'Shy  at the places that they fell, in the clearing.  I would have finished earlier if I had not been in such bad shape.   I buried them as they were, with all of their possessions, except their Vilythi's.  Those I had to take with me, to return to the goddess.

It took me another month to get back to the shrine, and then three full days to tell the sadden priest what had happened.  I wanted just to die at that point, but the insistant priest told me I had to attend the Ritual of Growth, the last rite one of my order must go through to become a full-fledged Knight of the Goddess.  I went along with it, expecting Elindale to reject me.  Then I could die in shame.

The night of the ceremony came, with one of the priest standing in the place that belonged to my fallen master.  I held my tongue, and continued with the ceremony, swearing my allegiance to the Goddess and her home.  The prayer of blessing was given, and I was now expected to present my Vilythi for finial blessing.  So I gently placed the pieces I could find on the alter, and fell to my knees…….

"Mother Goddess, I have failed ye in the most horrible of ways.  I lost my brother and my mentor due to blind fury, and broke the blade intrusted to me.  I do not feel worthy to be a Knight in yer service, and ask that ye let me leave in peace."

I sat there for a few minutes, expecting nothing to happen, except to be allowed to leave in peace.  Just as I was about to stand, an gentle voice spoke from behind me.

"Look upon my face, my child."
A shiver went up my spine, and slowly I turned to face the one being that at that moment I feared the most.  Elindale herself was standing before me.  I immediately fell to one knee, weeping.

"Oh Mother Goddess, have mercy on my…."

"Oh, silly one, get up."  She interrupted me.  " I am not here to chastise you, but to help you understand.  Now, will you PLEASE stand up and face me like a true fir."
Slowly I stood, to behold that glorious face.  I must have had a look of either shock, or fear, or both, because the goddess sighed.

"Young one, you did well.  D'Shy's time had come, and Daelith served as he was only capable of doing. You have brought back the stone of the shrine as I asked your master to instruct you to do.  Daelith gave his life so that you might defeat the creature.  You did not fail."
"But, but, my blade……..yer holy weapon…."

"…is not your choice, nor the one that was truly meant for you.  Do you have the axe that you took from the Oog?"

It took me a minute to realize that she wanted it now.  When I did realize it, she was already removing it from my pouch, and holding it.

"Now.  You have proved your faith by your time with your mentor.  You have proved you love by the grieving you have done.  You have proved you skill with the fighting and tracking you did in my name.  And you have proved you honor and your name with your presence here, even though you believe you failed.  You, Yulin Rochelet, are one of my chosen.   You are my Sal, my dear.   You are my holy Knight, and one of my chosen.  Take your weapon, Sal, and go forth to protect and serve me."

[Yulin then proceeded to remove an axe from his backpack.  The blade was of the purest silver, and engraved with many Firian runes, which being Usil, could not read.]

That, my cousin, is how I came to be called Sal'riEndale.  Chosen son of Elindale.  And that is why I use the axe.

And so ended the tale.  Scribed by Lache Rochelet, Usilelvyn of the house Rochelet, Mageling and Sage of the High City of Spur.

The Kryger VosRapier Story

It was the 3rd month on the year 259, I was 19 years old and ready to take on the world.  My father (Kalathar VosRapier) was a Devoted Sword Cleric of the Unknown, my mother was a Hand Cleric of the Unknown, and my sister was a Sword Cleric of Odarious—go figure.  Well it was my birthday, so my father came up and said, "Son, I believe it is time you started to learn how to defend yourself, the ways of religion, and how both affect us as a whole.  I glanced at him with an ambition he would never expect and said, "When do we start?"

No sooner did I get those words out of my mouth, we were out back in my father's training area sparring and learning battle tactics and skills.  My devotion to the Unknown was that of a Novitiate status—this part of my father's teachings really did not peak my interest as a young Hithual, but his hack and slash stories were the highlight of my day.  After awhile he gave up and focused all his energy towards the battle and combat skills I needed as a Hithual fighter.  Many a day I would come home nearly dead from the beating I had taken.

Even though I was taking a severe beating, I sometimes noticed that dad's health seemed to be getting increasingly worse as the days passed by in our training.  I did not even think twice about, for he was an old Hithual and had survived things some only dream about.  It wasn't until one day when I was a little concerned about my father and was waiting for him at the training area that I really started to worry.  He did not show.  I ran home as fast as I could, puffing and panting I yelled, "Mother where is dad?"  I then heard a voice coming from the secret hiding place under the hut where we were living.  I proceeded down the corridor to find my mother and sister sitting down there shivering in fear.  "What is wrong?" I yelled.  My mother looked at me with terror in her eyes and said, "Son we are being invaded.  They sounded the alarm and your father headed for the City of Krynn to help defend."

I immediately grabbed dad's old Giant Steel Mail out of the trunk along with his battle-axe and proceeded to head out the door, my adrenaline pumping so hard and fast I did not have time to be scared.  I ran to the mountains as fast as a Hithual possibly can (very slowly).  When I got within about 1500 meters from the battle, I heard the sound of clanging armor, screaming beasts, and tons of Hithuals yelling out battle commands.  I quickly made it up to the ridge of the mountain above where the city stood and looked down to see what exactly was attacking it.   With great surprise, I saw the ugliest looking creature I had ever seen.  If it had not been for me hearing the other Hithuals yelling "trolls," I would have never guessed what they were.

I readied my battle-axe and proceeded down the hill to advance in battle and help defend the City from this terrible invasion.  As I got down on a flat surface I realized these things were almost three times my size in height, so I dodged and weaved all the way to the city where I saw my father fighting off five trolls by himself.  I watched in awe for a few moments as he swung his blade with such grace and power, and runes began dancing all around him.  Suddenly a fire dart exploded on one of the trolls.  They did not seem to like fire very much at all cause when dad hit em with it they screamed like the dickens.  Dad was taking some serious blows during this battle, and just when I thought he might fall he yelled out by the power of the Unknown, "I pray thee heal me."  Am amazing glow surrounded him, all his wounds closed up, and he looked healthy as ever.

I quickly moved toward him to help what little I could.  I swung as hard as I could, a good blow to the back portion of the trolls left leg.  It immediately turned and clawed at me and then bit me in my arm—the pain was so tremendous that I dropped the axe.   The second the troll let go of my arm I reached down and grabbed the axe with my other hand and tried to swing again.  It was such a great blow to the trolls head, it let out a loud scream and fell dead.  My father dropped two more and was about to turn around and face the last one when the troll landed a critical claw to his torso and a devastating bite to his neck.  I had never heard my father scream in such pain ever before, and as I looked on I felt my adrenaline, anger, and emotion all come together in one as I swung my axe as hard as I could at the troll.  It was a critical hit to the troll's neck, for it paused for a moment and fell to the ground minus its head.  I immediately turned to my father as he lay there with blood squirting from his neck.

He attempted to bandage it the best he could and stared at me in the eyes and said, "I am very proud of you son, but I have something I want to tell you.  There is another VosRapier ye don't know about.  Ye have a brother named Vasile, son.  He left us when ye were very young.  He is a great warrior as you will be someday, so find him and continue your training.  He left to the south towards a City called Spur.  There son, you will encounter many different races and other adventurous folk, so be very careful 'cause not all are like our race and act honorably.  Here, I want ye to have me bastard sword and Giant Black Platinum Mail.  Make me proud, son.  Now take your sister to Spur with you, for she is ready to practice her priestess hood, tell your mother I love her, and move her north to the Hithual underground City of Kyrnn.  There she shall be safe and live happy amongst our kin.  In the City of Spur there lives a great priest of the Unknown named Armonius.  Find him and keep up your faith with the Unknown.  Also there is a CA there run by a Hithual named Kraggon.  He is a great fighter and ye can learn a lot from him in your final stages of training, son."

As he spurted out those last words and ceased to move or breath anymore, I grasped him and cried until I suddenly heard a voice from behind me.  It was a form dressed in the finest silk outfit I had every seen.  He had a eternal glow emulating from around his body and he hovered about 6 inches off the ground.  He said, "Kryger your father is only gone physically, but mentally he will always be with you.  His soul shall now be put to rest."  With one flick of his wrist the wounds on my father vanished.  Then he hovered close to my father and briefly laid his hand on his forehead, and within seconds they were both gone.  The only things that remained were his Platinum Mail, shield, bastard sword, and his amulet of the Unknown.  I gathered my father's belongings in a pile, finally I realized that all the trolls were gone when I looked around me, I saw roughly 60 Hithuals dead—but three times that number in trolls laid beside em dead as well.  Amidst my sorrow and grief, I felt a feeling of inspiration come over me as I remembered hearing my father dying words "you have a brother, son."  With this in mind, I attempted to rush back home quickly with all my father's belongings.  How I managed to carry all his and my belongings is still a mystery to me, but at the time I was in a different state of mind.

When I got back to the hut, I saw my mother crying and packing all her things in satchels and backpacks.  In shock, I said, "Where are ye going mother?"  She glanced at me with a look of grief and said, "My son, I know of your father's death.  I knew before he left that he would not return.  Tears of sorrow filled her eyes and she said, "He has been sick for sometime now.  I must go to the City of Krynn in the morning. Atoko and ye must head to Spur in the morning.  Ye father did tell ya of yer brother Vasile?  I am sorry I never told ye about him, but I did not want to loose you as well.  I watched the tears roll down her cheeks as she said, "He left about 15 years ago to fight the holy war against the Taathians, and we have not heard or seen of him since.  Please look after Atoko, for she is still young in mind and faith.   Spur has much to offer both of ye.  Take our saving, get settled, and find ye brother.  This journey shall take ye about five days my son, so be very careful.  May the Unknown guide ye there safely."  I packed all my belongings that I could carry in my four satchels and cried myself to sleep.  The next morning I discovered my mother had left a brief note for me a and some ale for us on the table.  I woke up Atoko, we gathered our things, and headed off to the south for the wonderful City of Spur.

****DAY # 1****
Atoko and I set off on foot following dad's ole maps that he had stored around the house.  Twas a quiet and peaceful day and not too cold for traveling.  Atoko and I had been no further than the mountains from our house, so this was definitely a change of pace.  We walked for roughly 13 hours without a sign of anything till we came along this old man peddling items on the side of the road.  He looked to be a very old human with barely enough energy or power to stand.  As we approached him he stood up immediately, leaning on a black laced cane with a ruby on the top of it, and spoke in a very young soft voice.  "Hello, my name is Jhortho.  I am selling items that ye may be interested in so please gander all ya want."

"Greetins, Jhortho this is Atoko and I am Kryger," I responded.  "We are headed to the great City of Spur."

"Well then you will need some ale for your vast journey will ye not?  I have the best ale in the valley, and tis said to be the best ale in the lands.  I dunno though 'cause I don't drink.  It's  not good for my health ya see."

With a look of surprise, I said in Hithual to Atoko, "This guy looks like he is over 100 years old and he talking about worrying about his health." I chuckled and said, "Well Jhortho, let me taste this legendary ale you have to sell." 
"Okay, follow me."

We followed Jhortho around his cart where he pulled out this keg that had "Ale Masters" written upon it.  I smiled at Jhortho as he poured some in a mug for Atoko and I to try.  I guzzled mine down fast and put my mug out for more, when he looked at me kind of strange and said, "This is fer buying not giving." "I know Jhortho, but I need to be able to taste it before I buy it." This ale tasted a lot different from what I was used to, but it sure was sweet and good.  "How much for the keg Jhortho?" I asked.  He pondered for a moment and said, "Hmmm.  How about 5 gold?" "Okay 5 gold it is."  I paid him and we went on our merry way.  We decided to keep our mugs full the rest of the day with this peculiar tasting ale.  About three or four hours passed and Atoko was getting tired, so we decided to make camp and move on in the morning.  We set up four-hour sleeping shifts for the watch; I took the first shift, which was uneventful along with the rest of the night.

****DAY # 2****
Atoko woke me up from her last shift and said, "Lets get going."  So, we got all our stuff ready and marched on.  We traveled at least six to eight hours when we happened along this very small village. Naturally curious, we ventured in.  When we got close, I could see a few short green-skinned forms standing about talking in a strange hackish language.  As we got even closer, the forms dispersed in all directions.  We continued to walk on when a elderly one of these forms stepped out and waved his cane with a skull attached to it at me.  I felt a probing sensation, then a tingle, and then it went away.  "What are you doing?" I yelled.  "Stop that now."

The form, seemingly unfazed by my yelling, advanced towards us.  I drew my bastard sword and got in a battle stance.  This also did not seem to scare him, but finally he spoke in a form of common, a very poor common at best.  He said, "Hello I be Grokk, leaber ub de Go-blin-als.  Who be you and why you be in my home?"

Trying not to laugh at his poor common tongue, I explained, "This is Atoko and I am Kryger.  We come from the village north of here called Kremlin.  We did not mean to invade in on your privacy.  We're just passing through, we are heading to the City of Spur."  His eyes got extremely big and he started spurting off words in that hackish language again.  Next thing I know, we had bout 30 to 40 Go-blin-als armed to the teeth surrounding us.  The elder Gobbie said, "We'b hab a gobbie here dat neeb to gob dar to be bak wif his family."  I raised an eye at Grokk and said, "You want us to transport a gobbie to Spur?  What is in it for us?" Grokk pondered for a moment and replied, "We'b can pab sparklies and monies forb it?"  I looked at Atoko and asked her in Hithual if she minded.  She shook her head no, so I said, "Yes we will bring the gobbie to the City of Spur for ale—I mean monies," I mumbled.  A smile came across his face and he said, "Kryber youb doing a goob deed tobay.  This gobbie be berry special.  He'b hab the mark ub a chaos noble and hab thrown rights to beeb Prince Mer-blin-al.  Be berry carful wib him.  He'b ib young and tends to geb intoob truble."

"My name is Kryger not Kryber," I mumbled. "Yes, we will be careful and get him to his destination safely I promise.  Immediately after we decided to take the Gobbie to Spur, the elder screamed out some horrifying words and the everyone started cheering and poking me with there little spears.  I started grumbling because the next thing I knew they are all grabbing Atoko and me and asking us to follow em to one of the little huts they live in.  We followed and went inside with one of em yelling something at us.  "Sleeb, sleeb, sleeb, go morbing, go morbing," he said.  I looked at him strange and assumed he was telling us to go to sleep and that we leave in the morning.  Tired, Atoko and I laid down and went to sleep.  

****DAY # 3****
Morning arrived with a spear poking me in my side and a Gobbie staring me eye to eye saying, "Lebs go, lebs go, geb up, geb up."  I woke up Atoko.  We got ready and waited to see which Gobbie we were escorting to Spur.  In minutes the elder Gobbie came out holding a hand of a 1'7" gobbie who looked as innocent as could be with eyes almost bigger than his head.  The little Gobbie was dressed in what looked like the remnants of a few rats, snakes, and whatever else he could get his little paws on.  I bowed briefly and reached out to greet the little fella, but he hissed and then tried to bite me.  Then he ran and hid behind the elder and shivered.   I gave out a little chuckle and said, "Is he going to wanna come with us?"
The elder bent down and said a few words to the little goblin, smiled, and said, "Yes I believe he is ready now."

"Okay lets go then, for we need to make up for lost time as it is." 

As we are leaving, Grokk says, "His name is Gagglebee or Gagz for short and he'll eat almost anything."  With all that said, we headed on our way.  I tried to make small talk with Gagz, but no doing on the first day.  He just scowled at me an hissed.  Every once in awhile I would catch him looking at my leg and licking his lips.  That is when I knew it was time for us to stop and eat some food.

We stopped briefly on the side of the road to eat and Gagz looked at me like "your going to go get me some food aren't ya?."  So, knowing I could not eat with him staring me in the face, I got up and tried to find some small rodents that he would eat.  I eventually found some stuff that he was satisfied with and boy was it messy.  Ack.  I almost got sick watching him eat and then add the skin to his armor.  Like glue it stuck there.  His odor was so atrocious I did all I could to make him walk in front of us or behind us, depending on which way the wind was blowing.  Well we had been traveling about eight hours and saw no sign of anything anywhere.  I looked at Gagz and said, "Do you know where we are at?"  He looked at me with that look of confusion as always, so I ceased asking him anything anymore.  The day seemed to fly by as it neared its end, so we made camp on the side of the road just out of view of anyone coming along.  We set up watches again and of course Gagz didn't stand any watch.  I grumbled at him and muttered beneath my breath, but at least the night was uneventful.  In the morning, we packed our stuff and headed out.

****DAY # 4****
Well, it was a blistering day out, the sun beating down like never before it seemed.  This told me it was time to break out the ole ale in a hurry.  I filled up Atoko's mug and mine, but Gagz kept pulling on my Platinum Mail saying, "Gib me, gib me, gib me."  He held out his hands and motioned for me to pour it in his hands so he could have some.  I looked at him with a funny grin and said, "You want some ale Gagz?"  He nodded his head so fast I thought his neck was going to break.  "Calm down my little friend," I said, "Sheesh I will give ya some."
I pulled out another mug from my backpack and poured Gagz some.  He guzzled it the second it hit the bottom of the mug.  I looked at him and said, "You sure your not part Hithual?"  I chuckled, but he just looked at me in confusion and blurted out, "Hibual, meb nob hibual, meb Mer-blin-al."  I nodded and we continued on our way without hearing another word from him.  We moved on at a pretty quick pace and did not see or hear a thing till we came upon a narrow crossing in the path.  A muffled sound came from the bushes to the east, so I said, "Shhhh....ye two hear that?"

They both nodded yes, so I started moving in that direction.  We tried to sneak up the best we could but then again we are Hithual not khats, so we made some noise.  Luckily, it did not out drown the yells for help I heard in the near distance.  We moved up most quietly to see two Elvish-looking forms kicking the crap out of the old man that sold us the ale a couple days ago.  I wondered for a minute, how that old man beat us here?  I jumped out of the bushes, readied my bastard sword, and said, "Leave him alone or ye shall die by my blade."  They both looked at me, laughed, and then continued to kick Jhortho on the ground.  I advanced at the one on the right, and swung and hit him with a perfect blow to the torso area.  He fell and started yelling in pain, while the other advanced and swung a scimitar at me.  He hit me in my left leg right below my mail, and although it hurt like crazy I ignored it and swung back.  I hit him in the arm and he dropped his sword and ran.  I sat down and said, "Atoko heal me please.  I am hurt bad." 

She came over to me and laid her hands upon my chest for a moment and said a few religious words.  I felt a bolt of healing go through my body.  I beamed at Atoko, hugged her, and said, "Thankies sister.  I got up, walked over to Jhortho, and said, "Greetins my friend.  I see our paths have met again?"

Jhortho got up and said, "Do I know you?  I meet so many people, I tend to forget.  Sorry if I have offended you."

I smiled at Jhortho and said, "No offense taken friend.  We met a couple days ago and you sold me some ale.  Well, we really need to be getting going, so take care and be more careful next time.  We may not be around to help you next time."

I looked around to see where Gagz was and found him digging through the dead elf's belongings.  "Gagz?  Come here what are you doing?" I asked.

He popped straight up, put his hands behind his back, and said, "Nubbin, I'b doob nubin, jus lookin ab de elb here."

"Well lets go we got to get going." I said, muttering something beneath my breath  He looked at me all innocent and started to follow.  It wasn't no more than three or four hours later that I spotted a City about 10 to 15 miles away.  I jumped up and down, thinking we were almost there.  "I see the city over the next ridge."

With that little bit of excitement, we did not care to stop and rest.  We wanted only to get there as quickly as possible.  We proceeded to the glorious City of Spur which was only 2 hours of travel away.  We finally came within full view of the city and advanced towards its gates.  There stood two fully armed guards with their pikes readied.  The guards stood motionless as we walked through the marble archway.  The second I turned around to hug Atoko, I noticed Gagglebee was heading off down an alley.  I followed as fast as I could to catch up with him and looked around frantically trying to find him.  I followed a street down near its end and started to smell this nasty odor.  It was so bad I almost hurled a couple times.  I continued to look around at what looked to be the city trash dump.  I yelled, "Gagglebee where are you?"  Just when I was about to give up, I saw something moving in the garbage to the northeast of where Iwas standing.  I proceeded that way with caution, and when I got like 5 feet away from the noise, Gagglebee jumped out of a pile of trash yelling, "Leeb, leeb, me lib here, me lib here."  I laughed at him for a second and then said, "Come on lets go, you want to see your mother don't you?"  Eventually, he shook his head yes and decided to followed me back to the town square.

There in the center of town square, I saw a old gobbie sitting on the ground eating what looked to be the remnants of a rat or rodent of some sort.  I approached him and said, "Greetins my name is Kryger and I was asked to escort this gobbie to Spur safely.  I was wondering if you could bring him with you when ya go back to your home?  He is the Mer-blin-al or something like that.  He keeps yelling it out as if it is important, so what do you say?  His mother lives in this town somewhere.  I believe Grokk said her name was Skwashie WormSquisher, do ye know her?"
The old gobbie looked up and said, "I'b no'b him mum, I'b tak dar now'b."

I looked at Gagz and said, "Well little buddy, hope to see you around.  Enjoy the City of Spur."

Atoko and I went the opposite direction to find a fellow Hithual that might know my brother.  We strolled on through town checking out all the shops and stuff and saw a red headed 2'11 Hithual come out of a gem shop.  I made my way up to him and said, "Greetins kin, my name is Kryger and this is my sister Atoko.  We are new to Spur and are looking for our brother."  The Hithual looked at us and said, "Greetins my name is Dolak.  How are ye this fine day?  Who is yer brother friend?  Maybe I can help ye find him?

"Vasile VosRapier," I said with pride. "He is a great warrior I hear among our people."
"Hmmm...Vasile, Vasile.  The name does not ring a bell for some reason, but I tell ya who will know.  Kraggon.  He is in the Rose tavern.  Let's go.  I shall bring you there to speak with him."

We followed him down a couple streets and finally to a wood building with a ale mug and a keg sign slanted in a "V" shape swinging above the door.  "This is it kin, I really must run.  I am late to my meeting so be well and enjoy Spur."  We exchanged bows and good-byes and proceeded into the tavern.  To my surprise when I looked around, there were like 15 Hithuals in there drinking and having a good ole time.  I looked around the room trying to spot the one they call Kraggon.  We seemed to have piqued a little interest 'cause a few had stopped drinking and were looking at us curiously.  A rather large Hithual stood up from the bar and approached us.  "Greetins I am Kraggon, are ye two new to Spur?"

I looked upon Kraggon, who was twice my gerth and had three times as many scars from battle, and I let out a quiet gulp.  "Yeah we are new and we are looking for our brother Vasile VosRapier.  Do you know him?"

A big smile came to his face and he said, "Vasile is ye Brother?"

"Yes he is and this is our sister Atoko." I answered most quickly.

Kraggon raised his hands for all to be silent and said, "Well, let me be the first to welcome both of ye to Spur.  Your brother was at the hall last I saw him.  Come with me and I will bring ya there.  As we journeyed through Spur, everyone waved and bowed to Kraggon with the utmost respect.  Atoko and I were in awe with all the different races and the respect they showed towards us.  We finally got to a huge bronze door with the letters CA engraved upon it.  A shield, hammer, and forge were also inset into it.  Kraggon made a gesture, said a few words, and the huge door opened wide to reveal two Hithuals sitting down drinking ale.

One was dressed in the nicest ceremonial robes and the other looked like the meanest fighter I've ever seen.  They both greeted Kraggon and then glanced in our direction.  The religious Hithual noticed my medallion and a smile came across his face.  "Greetins kin," he said most cheerfully.  "I am Armonius the revered one."

I bowed and said, "Greetins this is Atoko and I am Kryger,."  The second I said our names the mean looking Hithual glared at me with a look from hell and said, "What did you say your names were again?" "Ah.  Atoko and Kryger and we came from the great divide to meet our brother Vasile and to further my training."

He stood up and walked towards us with a evil grin upon his face.  A nervous twitch went down my spine as he looked us over.  He spoke with a gruff voice and said, "You're a little too skinny and small to be a Hithual aren't you?"  I was to nervous to say anything so I just nodded up and down.  He smiled and said "Greetins my brother and sister, I am your brother Vasile."  I beamed at him with the biggest smile and then jumped up and hugged him.  Atoko joined in our group hug which lasted for quite a while.

We sat around and drank ale until we all passed out from fatigue, not ale consumption.  After we all gained consciousness about six to eight hours later, Vasile looked at me and said, "So you wanna practice your skills do ya?"

"Very much so brother.  Will ye teach me?"

"Of course I will train you.  We shall start first thing in the morning after I get your living arrangements all set and catch up on all the gossip from home."

Well, as I proceeded to tell Vasile about the troll invasion and that our father had died, a look of the utmost sorrow and sadness took over Vasile's face.  A tear formed and rolled down his depression soiled cheek.  He spoke with a saddened tone and said, "How is mother doing?"  I explained the whole situation to him—about how mother moved to Krynn and I took Atoko with me so she could further her religious studies.  He put a hand on each of our shoulders and said, "Well lets find ye two some ale,  I mean food and living quarters so we may start both of your training.  Armonius will guide you to the temple district Atoko.  He can help you three times better then I could even think of, for I am a fighter and know very little about religion."
Vasile got us all situated with living quarters and introduced us to a few people on the way.  I decided to go to sleep because our training started early in the morning.  I laid down and said a few prayers for my father, mother, Atoko and my new found brother Vasile.  No sooner did I close my eyes, it was morning already and Vasile was up with a full mug of ale already.  "Well get up bro.  We got a lot of training to do."  I finally got up, gathered myself, and got dressed.  Vasile led me to a what looked to be a fighters guild of some sort.

There were a lot of fighters practicing a lot of different skills.  The first month he trained me in a technique of how to block blows with my shield and then I learned how to treat myself if I was to get hurt.  Soon I learned a neat trick of how to disarm another person while in a combat.  A couple months passed while I practiced those three skills and wacked at trees with me bastard sword.  I would get brave every so often and challenge Vasile.  Ouch, big mistake there.  He would beat me till I was black and blue, but as the months past I got better and better.  Someday I will beat him, I would sigh to myself.

This was our daily routine every day, no breaks, no days off, for my brother was the real deal Hithual fighter.  Every night when we were done training, we would go to the Rose Tavern or the hall and drink ale all night.  It was rumored that my brother emptied the shipment of ale that came from the great divide, in one night mind you.  Sheesh, and I used to think that Solic is bad.  Put them two together and ya better hide anything that resembles ale.

Well it was about the six month mark when Vasile said, "I think its time you distinguished yourself in the fighters guild.  Lemme explain how this works.  See first ya fight everyone in the guild over the next two weeks and depending on how ye do is where ya are ranked in the guild."  Then he proceeded to tell me that he was ranked in the low 30's.  On that little bit of info I thought for a moment and said, "hmmmm...no wonder I have been getting the crap beat out of me everyday."

The big day had finally come.  I fought 20 fighters and finished the day with two wins and eighteen losses.  This was about how every day went for the whole two weeks.  The last day they read off the ranking and names of the people in their respectable spots.  I wound up being number 99 and I was thrilled to death.  I wanted to get so drunk to celebrate that it wasn't even funny.  As happy as I was, Vasile was equally unhappy with my performance for he had expected better from me.  So for the following six months we trained three times as hard as normal.  He wore me out from the second I woke up till it was time to hit the tavern for our traditional ale drinking contests, which normally ended up with the barkeep throwing us out for insufficient funds.

Well days came and went so fast that before I knew it I was ranked in the 60's then the 50's and started putting on some serious weight and muscle to boot.  I was a stocky 450lbs at 3'11.  I finally matched my brothers size, but was far from his skill at arms.  Months and months passed and I moved up on the guild listings with haste as did Vasile.  As I got better, Vasile seemed to get better.  I couldn't seem to beat him in his skills.  I tried on a daily basis to do so, but still wound up getting pummeled every time.  ::sighs::  

My goal in life was now to be able to hang with my brother in a spar type battle without getting beat up severely.  So from then on every day when we were done training, Vasile would head right to the tavern and I would slyly sneak off and continue to train with either Forlan or Rebel.  Word was that they were two of the best Hithual warriors in Spur.  I trained with one of these two for at least six to eight hours every night.  During this time I had also learned many other fighting techniques and styles from them.  After about three months of this sort of extra training, I seemed to maybe have the edge on Vasile in a couple of my skills so I once again challenged him to a spar.  We stood toe to toe looking at each other, bowed briefly, and stood back in our fighting stances.  Vasile lashed at me with the first decent blow to my right arm,  and I swung back and was easily blocked by his shield.  Then he swung again and I barely deflected it with my shield.  This went on for like an hour and a half with both of us only getting hit maybe 12 times total.  Just as I started feeling that I was doing well, fatigue started setting in, and my shield and sword became very heavy and cumbersome.  As I got more and more tired, Vasile used that to his advantage and started knocking the crap out of me.

As I was getting beat around, I remembered back to what dad taught me about our god blessing us with strength if we pray for it.  So I yelled out by the power of Unknown, "I pray thee strengthen me," and not even a second later a spark flew and hit me in the chest with a jolt of energy.  I felt more refreshed then if I had gotten 12 hours of sleep.  I stood up and began a number of flourishing blows at Vasile, and he countered all but one.  A strong blow to his right arm convinced him to drop his weapon and begin administering first aid.  This did not phase me for I continued to attack him and accomplish my goal of defeating him.  He managed to successfully thwart all my blows and heal the couple he didn't.  After about three and a half to four hours of constant battle, we both finally fell over from fatigue and claimed it to be a tie.  Vasile looked at me and said, "Brother ye have come along way and I am proud of your accomplishments and to be your brother."  A sense of caring and sensitivity came over me as I released a tear of accomplishment for me and one of love for my brother who got me where I am today.  For that I salute him and to this day look up to him. ::Kryger beams at Vasile::  My training with Vasile lessened, but our hunting and drinking increased drastically.   Nothing much has changed since those days except Vasile is still ahead of me on the fighters guild at # 2 and I trail him by 3 slots at # 5.  This is the story and life of one Kryger VosRapier.
