 Well, here it is the eagerly anticipated(by at least 2 or 3 people)second 
eddition of the Dragon Fire Chronicle. Normally, the DFC will only be 
printing on a monthly basis, but when this issues story on the Haunted 
House came across my desk, I decided I had to make a special Halloween 
edition. I hope you will all enjoy it. 
  First in this issue, we have an interview with the Guildmaster of the 
Fighters Guild. After listening to your comments regarding Crunch 
Bonebreaker's interview with a Dragon, we tried to get him to make a return 
appearance for this issue. Unfortunately, Crunch was last seen chasing 
a half-dozen thieves down dismal lane, and could not be bothered for this 
issue. 
  Following the interview we have another Secian Guide for the perplexed. 
In truth I think it may be a Guide towards causing Perplexity, but I present
it for your perusal regardless. Then, we have a story by Lorelei of the
really long last name, regarding some rather implausible happenings in the 
Spur one halloween night. All I shall say regarding this piece is that not 
even an Elder will ever make me inflict my singing upon others.
  Finally, we arrive at the heart of this issue. A guided tour of the
Haunted Mansion known by so many throughout the realm. This tour was given
to Jascye the Forester by the current owner of the Mansion, one Xavier
the Muatan-al. Braving great risk to himself, Jascye endured a night of
terror to bring you this story. We hope you enjoy it.
  Finally we bring you another story by Lorelei of the far to long last 
name. This one regards a Secian she claims to have once known, who found 
that obssesions can be a very dangerous thing. 
  In addition we of course present you with some poems from the more 
bardically inclined members of the Spur, as well as our standard Rise of the
Classes column. Regretfully, we once again received no submissions from any
actuall Bards. Perhaps in addition to crippling their skills, the Elders 
have also crippled their compositional abilities. Fortunately, a Dragon and
Leuian were able to come to the rescue of the Hearthstone. 
  Well, I hope you enjoy this special issue. If it seems a little rushed, 
well....I didn't know there was going to be a special issue untill about 5 
days ago. I think it is a worthy effort though, and I think you will all 
enjoy it. I know I did.

I had the pleasure of intervuing the current Guildmaster of the Fighters, 
one Kilmaron Macduff. What follows is my conversation with this self
proclaimed creature of chaos.


Fesor(me):  'Can you tell me a little about your race?'

Kilmaron:  'hmmmm.  Yeah.  We are secretive.  Mainly we are creatures of 
chaos.  We take pride in causing others frustration.  Some of the more 
drastic of my race will actuall attack just about anything in sight.  While 
others..like myself, will just do what we can to pester people.  We 
particularly like pestering other elven races.  They are just jealous of us 
because of our greater abilities.  Most of us take up the position of Thief 
or RuneMage.  But I chose the way of the warrior and use my better then 
average magick abilities to back up my physical prowess.  I am the head of
my guild at present, so I guess I did not make too bad a choice.'

Fesor:  'I know this might sound weird, but rumor has it that San Elves 
were created by Chaos.  Is this true?'

Kilmaron:  ' Hmm..not sure i can answer that.  It's more like we are Chaos. 
That isn't to say that all my race is evil, but evil is a relative term 
that holds no meaning to us.'

Fesor:  ' People say that you(San Elves) are related to Fir and Usil Elves, 
but I have heard that you deny any relation to them.  Why?'

Kilmaron:  ' Hmm.  I think they more or less tend to refuse to acknoledge 
us, but if we are related, then certainly we are the dominant of the three.
We share similar appearances and that is all.  I have no blood relation 
with any Firian or Usil elf.  That I know.  If there is one thing about my 
race that stands out, it would be that we can't take what we give.  That is 
why we usually tend to be loners and very rarely in the company of our own 
kind unless of the same bloodclan.

Fesor: ' What would you do if a Usil or Fir Elf came, and asked you for 
help, putting aside cultural differences?'

Kilmaron: ' Well depending on my mood at that very moment, I would either 
aggrivate this person to the point of provoking an attack, and then leap at 
them with intense ferocity....or I would possibly assist depending on the 
request thus proving further my superiority over thier off shoot race.  And 
he/she would never live it down.

Fesor:  'I've seen San lves who are friendly to others, including other 
Elves.  Is this bad?  And if so, what would the other San Elves do to 
him/her?'

Kilmaron:  ' Well I can't speak for all of my race as all of us have our 
outcasts.  I would speculate that most of these Sanene are either young and 
not set in their ways, or that they are setting these others up for even 
more severe acts of chaos.

Fesor:  ' What would happen if a San Elf went to a temple of another 
alignment?

Kilmaron:  ' Ummmm...that will never happen.  That can't happen.  We are 
not given choice of which alignment to follow.  We are chaos and Chaos is 
us.'

That concludes my intervue with Kilmaron.  My conlusion is that if you are
to trust a Sanne, then you would be well advised to do so from a distance.

                                          Fesor Dulligo of Leuia

In the spirit of Felbin, here's another Secian's Guide for Newbies:

1)  Don't pull on a Leuian's tail
2)  Don't ask a Thugian what he's having for Lunch.
3)  Don't draw shapes all on yourself with a magic marker and say you're a 
    runemage.
4)  Don't ask a Penthanian if he has a relative trapped in the jewelry 
    store.
5)  Don't ask an Arachnian if he can knit you a sweater.
6)  It's considered impolite to ask a Dragon what he wants to be when he   
    grows up.
7)  Don't tell a Leuian that she needs a manicure.
8)  It's not a good idea to ask a Goblin-Al to hold your coinpurse while  
    you go to the bathroom.
9)  Don't ask an Alarian if she has any Play-Dough (tm).
10) It is considered impolite to ask an Anthian to stay away from your  
    newly washed cart.

That's all for now!  Have fun!  :)

It Happened in the Spur
A true story of horror and mayhem
By Lorelei Nilsfulcentruali

  It was one of those nights that nobody should be out in. In any other 
city, the houses and taverns would be locked up tight, almost as if by 
silent agreement. But this was the Spur, a city that never sleeps. 
Adventurers of every kind and caliber jostled each other, every one of them 
focused on their business and nothing else.
  If they had been able to see the being high above them rubbing its hands 
and cackling, they might have had a different attitude. A form so dark and 
loathsome as to defy reason was watching through its magic glass. Condemned 
to be banished from the Spur forever, it greedily awaited this night each 
year. For this was the one night out of all others that it was allowed free 
reign. This night, it would not be kept hidden, locked away. For tonight was 
Halloween.
  The Spurian citizens were not worried about any unknown fear. They, in 
their extreme egotism, felt they could handle any danger. But this being 
wasn't just any creature. It was the collected repressed desires of all the 
Elders. Each little impulse to wreak havoc that welled up in those majestic 
beings' collective bosoms. Unable to be implemented, due to their strict and 
unyielding duty, they had finally collected together in a dark hidden place.
The most evil impulses, those from Tilgen, had taken charge and molded the 
group into a sentient being of pure chaos.
  Even now, those nasty little Tilgen thoughts were making themselves felt. 
With a snarl and a wave of its hand, the creature sent power crashing down 
on top of the Spur. Although there was no fire, storm, or other visible 
destruction, the town was rocked to its foundations. It was a moment before 
anyone would notice. The creature sat back and laughed, watching in snarling
anticipation.
  Thiarin'a was the first to notice, although not the first to react to it. 
It intruded into his dreams. Suddenly, half-awake, he had a vision that the 
golden horde that he slept upon was a hundred times its former size. The 
mammoth amounts of treasure that were piled in his lair had grown to 
ridiculous proportions. Even the cave itself had grown into a cavern that 
could have housed the entire Thieves Guild. Pleased, he rolled over and 
wallowed, oblivious.
  Acinonyx, adventuring in the Plains south of town, realized the situation 
quicker. One moment she had towered over the rogue she was fighting. Now, 
she barely came up to his knees. In a moment, her mind was flooded with 
telepathic cries of distress from all of her kin.
  Acinonyx snarled and chopped off the rogue's leg at the knee. Ignoring 
the writhing thief, she quickly took stock. Horror gradually took over her 
noble features, even as the link in her mind confirmed her worst fears. 
Every single dragon in the Spur had been turned into Drag-al.
  The demon didn't hesitate to add another element to the chaos as the 
newly born Drag-als began to flail about frantically. Every skeleton in the 
lands turned into a homicidal clown. Butterflies the size of houses, with 
the face of Tammy Faye Baker, began to fly down the streets. The Leuian 
Pride members began to howl, having been transformed into various types of 
terriers. All the Arachnians had simultaneously experienced total bladder 
failure, and were completely covered in their own gooey webbing.
  Gods no longer answered their followers prayers. Many of the clerics 
around the realm chanted in vain. Adventurers in need of divine assistance 
went unheard. Instead, the faithful received a monotone recording. "We're 
sorry, the god you have dialed is not in service. Please check the pantheon 
and try again."
  Dragonfly, deep inside the Wretches' caves, attempted to resurrect a 
fallen comrade, and instead turned him into a Lich that immediately slew 
the entire party. Not satisfied, it then animated their undead corpses and 
forced them to stage a rather witty production of The Pirates of Penzance 
for its amusement. The Lich particularly enjoyed Ragarn Lazlo in the role 
of Mabel.
  Everyone's armor turned into torches. A moment later, it all turned back 
into its original form. Unbelieveably, this hardly fazed anyone. 
It seems that the Spurian citizens were used to phenomenon such as this, 
and had not reacted. Frustrated, the demon howled and tried again. The long 
awaited berserk skill was suddenly implemented, but only for Secians. The 
little ones began to rampage, killing everything in sight, all the while 
swelling to the size of a fourth-stage dragon. "Shinies, shinies, shinies!" 
they screamed, ripping the center of Town apart.
  The elders began to try and counter the effects of the beast. But, they 
were powerless against its might, mostly due to the fact they were laughing 
too hard. All the gems in Dragon's Gate exploded, covering everyone with 
lime jello. Gold and silver began to melt, soaking clothing with what 
smelled suspiciously like chocolate. Everyone was suddenly compelled to do 
the Wave, which undulated across the town, back and forth.
  All would have been lost. It seemed that there was no hope. But evil will 
always turn on itself. From deep within the creature, its own impulses had 
started down the path that would end in its demise. For the Ferragus 
impulses, not content with altering the Spur, suddenly changed Jaxie into a 
1957 pink Cadillac. In retaliation, the Jaxie impulses attempted to make 
Ferragus perform a polka, but they hit Gharzagh instead. Gharzagh's evil 
thoughts, already provoked by the failure of its' armor-to-torches idea, 
melded Andon and Tilgen into one being, which instantly began to fistfight 
with itself. Ambrosious' thoughts simply wandered off, hoping to find a cup 
of tea.
  The frightening magics began to be focused higher and higher into the 
heavens, towards the Elders' home, and the prison of the creature. Things 
gradually began to return to normal, although the aftereffects would be 
felt for many years. Dragons, especially, sought out therapy to cope with 
their trauma. Secians remained well beyond their normal size for several 
days. Ragarn began to star in musicals in the Bards hall, regaling everyone 
with his lovely soprano voice, and Skratchnar had a tendency to go into 
hysterics at the sight of dogs.
  But in all times of crises, there are aftershocks that must be dealt with.
And the citizens of the Spur responded courageously. They were as safe as 
those who live in such an adventurous place can be. At least, for another 
year....

Tour of the Haunted House

  I made it a personal quest to get as much history behind tha haunted 
house as possible.  Thus, I set out to learn all I could of its deep and
dark secrets. Little did I know that I might find the original owner of this
house of horror. Recognizing the chance of a lifetime though, I fought down 
thoughts for my own personal safety and embarked upon a tour of this Dark 
Mansion. What follows is an account of my tour, given by the undying 
owner a Muatan-al named Xavier.
  
The front porch extends across the width of the house. You stand
before a magnificent oak door bearing the emblem of a flaming lion.
You're getting a bad feeling about this. Maybe no one is home
today.  An open oak door is here. This area is illuminated. Obvious
paths: north south west.
Xavier says, "Greetings, and welcome to my home."
Xavier says, "I would recommend that you leave your pet out here."
Xavier waves his hand and utters something unintelligeible. 
Xavier pushes the door open, it creaks slowly and dust falls from
the hinges.
You follow Xavier through an open oak door...
The dark, dusky entryway gives you the impression that no one has
lived in the house for years. Two suits of armor with crossed
halberds guard an archway to the east.  An open oak door, an open
wood door, an open mahogany door, an archway, and a stairs are
here. This room is illuminated. Obvious exits: None.
Xavier says, "What's done is done, the past cannot be altered."
Xavier says, "This is a lesson I have learned, if there is nothing
more I can give to the world, it is that."
Xavier says, "The owner of the estate."
Xavier says, "Through this door that you just entered also walked
once the Emperor of Frontacia."
Xavier says, "This place was different then, far different..."
Jascye says, "Where might I find this Emperor?"
Xavier stares at Jascye.
Jascye turns a deathly shade of pale.
Xavier says, "You are looking at him."
Xavier sighs and stares about the room for a moment. Xavier smiles.
Xavier says, "The townspeople took over an hour to batter through
that door."
Xavier says, "so strange"
You see Xavier reach out and touch a closed oak door.
You follow Xavier through a stairs...
Except for the squeaky floor, the upstairs is ominously quiet.
Several bedroom doors are here. You suspect this is not the place
to bring that special person you know for a relaxing
interlude.  A stairs is here. This room is illuminated. 
Obvious exits: east.
Xavier says, "They say that a man may sometimes be judged by the
company he keeps."
You see Xavier reach out and touch a closed door.
Xavier smiles.
Xavier says, "This house was home to my family for several generations."
Xavier says, "I suppose all families have their eccentrics.. we
were blessed with a full helping."
You follow Xavier through an open door...
This large room appears to have been used by some eccentric owner
as a place to keep pets. Lots and lots of them. They still live in
here, feeding on and being fed on by huge rats.  An open door is
here. This room is illuminated. Obvious exits: east.
Jascye says, "what generation were you?"
Xavier raises an eyebrow at Jascye.
Xavier smiles icily.
Xavier says, "the last."
Xavier says, "Aunt Felleny lived in this room." Xavier says, "she was so 
fond of little creatures." 
Xavier says, "They turned out to be fond of her in return." Xavier says, 
"I believe that is her"
Xavier says, "ah, never mind."
Xavier smiles and drifts casually over a skeleton.
You follow Xavier east...
The shredded, chewed, and eaten remains of furniture gets underfoot
as you move about. An old rumor has it that the manor's treasures
were hidden in this room, but now that you are here you are loathe
to touch anything. This room is illuminated. Obvious exits: west.
Xavier says, "this was one of the first rooms the townspeople came
when they invaded."
Xavier says, "Following the scent of gold they imagined was hidden
here."
Xavier says, "obviously they were mistaken."
You follow Xavier west...
This large room appears to have been used by some eccentric owner
as a place to keep pets. Lots and lots of them. They still live in
here, feeding on and being fed on by huge rats.  An open door is
here. This room is illuminated. Obvious exits: east.
You follow Xavier through an open door...
Except for the squeaky floor, the upstairs is ominously quiet.
Several bedroom doors are here. You suspect this is not the place
to bring that special person you know for a relaxing interlude.  A
stairs is here. This room is illuminated. Obvious exits: east.
Xavier just closed the open door.
Xavier just opened the closed door.
You follow Xavier through an open door...
First glance makes you think this room is as unused as all the
rest, but there are tracks in the carpet, and the dust is stirred
up. What could be the murmurs of an old house or the whispering of
men silences as you enter.  An open door is here. This room is
illuminated. Obvious exits: east.
Xavier says, "The guest bedroom."
Xavier says, "It was unoccupied when they attacked... afterward,
there were a few permanent guests  quartered here."
You follow Xavier east...
There is a table standing upright in the center of the room. It is
suspiciously clean compared to everything else you have seen. The
curtain billows slightly and you hear the scrape of metal. This
room is illuminated.  Obvious exits: west.

Something cold brushes the back of your neck.

Xavier says, "Sometimes you can see the"
Jascye says, "ACK somthin just touched ma!"
Xavier says, "Oh, I believe you have met one of our guests." 
Xavier smiles.
Xavier says, "They come here to play cards on occasion." Xavier says, "I 
asked them to find another haunt this eve.. so that this place would be 
quiet for once."
Xavier says, "The souls of townsmen."
Xavier says, "vigilantes!"
Xavier mutters something beneath his breath.
You follow Xavier west...

Several bedroom doors are here. You suspect this is not the place

stairs is here. This room is illuminated. Obvious exits: east.
You follow Xavier east...
Dark liquid runs down the walls of this hallway. A chill breeze
whisks through, bringing with it a fetid smell. You can hear a
scratching in the distance. There is a door in the eastern wall.
This room is illuminated. Obvious exits: west.
Xavier smiles strangely.
Xavier says, "Ah... still it flows"
Xavier says, "do you see it as well?"
Xavier says, "the river of life"
Xavier says, "payment and reward for past... deeds." Xavier says, "I am 
cursed to bath in it each night." Xavier just opened the closed door.
You follow Xavier through an open door...
The Master bedroom enters on a tiled path leading up to a wash
basin and an unbroken full-length mirror. On either side of the
tiled area is a carpeted region one step lower.  An open door is
here. This room is illuminated. Obvious exits: north south.
Xavier just closed the open door.
Xavier says, "The Master Bedroom."
Jascye says, "Your room, Xavier?"
Xavier says, "some of them came here, almost finding me, but I was
well hidden."
Xavier frowns.
Xavier pushes on the mirror and it rotates open.
You follow Xavier through a silver mirror...
You step through the mirror into a secret room. Old books and
papers are stacked everywhere. A usable cot rests out of the way,
and some comfortable looking chairs are here as well.
This room is illuminated. Obvious exits: None.
Xavier says, "This was where I heard them ransack and rampage
through my home."
Xavier frowns.
Xavier yells, "Slay the murderer of our Lady! Kill the mad
bastard!"
Xavier says, "fools"
Xavier says, "what little they knew of the truth."
Xavier sighs.
You follow Xavier through a mirror...
The Master bedroom enters on a tiled path leading up to a wash
basin and an unbroken full-length mirror. On either side of the
tiled area is a carpeted region one step lower.  A closed door is
here. This room is illuminated. Obvious exits: north south.
You follow Xavier south...
Against the south wall, a canopied bed still rests. Someone is in
it, 'asleep' a long time now. A closet door has been removed from
the east wall and smashed to pieces by vandals. This room is illuminated. 
Obvious exits: north east.
Xavier says, "I granted some of them rest from their efforts..."
Xavier says, "This one was most fortunate."
Xavier smiles coldly at the body on the bed. 
Xavier says, "I believe his name was Edgar." 
Xavier says, "the Meister of the ville without." 
Xavier says, "He led them, and so received a place of honor."
You follow Xavier north...
The Master bedroom enters on a tiled path leading up to a wash
basin and an unbroken full-length mirror. On either side of the
tiled area is a carpeted region one step lower.  A closed door is
here. This room is illuminated. Obvious exits: north south.
You follow Xavier north...
Jascye's flaming large wood torch flickers for a moment.
 Against the north wall rests a crooked desk, the papers sitting on
it crumble to dust as you touch them. On the east wall is a tapestry 
depicting a stern, dark-haired man wearing red, orange,
and brown. This room is illuminated. Obvious exits: south.
Xavier sighs and touches the papers, watching them turn to dust.
Xavier says, "I was completing these last orders when they came."
Xavier frowns.
Jascye says, "Who's portrait is tha, Xavier?"
Xavier says, "moments from affixing the seal."
Xavier says, "oh, no, that was my father."
Xavier says, "Had I time to issue these, it may not have happened."
Xavier says, "again, the past cannot be changed."

You follow Xavier through a tapestries...
The small, barred window gives you a tantalizing taste of freedom.
The wind whistles shrilly through a broken pane. The back of a
tapestry acts as a door to a room to the west.  A stairs is here.
This room is illuminated. Obvious exits: None.
Xavier chuckles.
Xavier says, "I cast the spell from here."
Xavier says, "All of the hallways in the mansion, all the corridors..."
Xavier says, "twisted about each other, like a nest of serpents."
Xavier says, "most never found the way out."
Xavier says, "they remain here with me."
Xavier says, "In their last moments, weak from hunger and thirst,
I sat before them and sipped my wine, reveling in their fate."
Xavier says, "They who would destroy me."
Xavier sighs.
Xavier says, "But so fleeting... and had they accomplished what
they desired, perhaps I would have found peace as well." Xavier frowns.
You follow Xavier through a stairs...
You have reached a stairwell whose creaky steps wind their way up
a dark turret. You can hear the wind whistling through an opening
far above. This room is illuminated. Obvious exits: southeast.
Xavier says, "Mark well this stairway, this is the only exit from
the mansion."
You follow Xavier southeast...
The hallway here is dark as pitch. The brightest lights and sharpest eyes 
make little headway into piercing the gloom about you. This room is

Xavier says, "In chaos they came for me, determined to destroy the
order I had created for them, and I gave them chaos." 
Xavier says, "it was their final reward."
You follow Xavier east...
This short hallway has blue tile, blue walls, and a blue ceiling.
On one wall is a painting depicting a glowing blue sword fashioned
from some tremendous gem. This room is illuminated. Obvious exits:
east west.
Xavier says, "there is light here."
Xavier says, "Sapphirus."
You see Xavier reach out and touch a blue painting.
Jascye says, "The sword?"
Xavier says, "long since rusted into oblivion I suppose." 
Xavier says, "It's image remains however."
Xavier says, "with this blade I kept the barbarians from my city,
and instilled the order that preserved it through all the attacks."
You follow Xavier east...
The hallway here is dark as pitch. The brightest lights and 
sharpest eyes make little headway into piercing the gloom about
you. This room is illuminated. Obvious exits: north* northeast

You follow Xavier south...
The walls in this all-green hallway curve back and forth like a
snake. For some reason you pause to reflect on childhood memories,
and you become somewhat wistful. This room is illuminated. Obvious
exits: north south.
Xavier says, "Before the spell, this was to be the nursery for our
children."
Xavier says, "before"

The floor, walls, and ceiling of this hallway are done entirely in
red Velvet. On one wall is a painting of a defiant-looking woman
surrounded by several hounds. Her eyes seem to follow you as you
pass. This room is illuminated. Obvious exits: east west.
Xavier sighs sadly and stares at the portrait.
(Xavier whispers, "Karolyn...")
Xavier says, "I held her in my hands, saw the light fade
from her eyes."
Xavier says, "felt her last breath caress my cheek... the last
feeling I had in life."
Xavier says, "It stays with me like a curse, for it Is my curse."
Xavier says, "The voices said that we would be so powerful... so
great, nothing would be beyond our reach."
Xavier says, "She did not want to do it."
Xavier frowns.
Xavier says, "She warned me that it was false, it was a lie" You see Xavier 
reach out and touch a red cloth painting. 
Xavier says, "the past is done."

The remains of several beds and dressers are the only things of
note in this simple room. A heavy layer of dust covers the wreckage. From 
somewhere you think you catch a howling sound. This room is illuminated. 
Obvious exits: north* west.
Xavier says, "the servants' quarters."
Xavier smiles.
Xavier says, "they have the evening off."
You follow Xavier west...
The area brightens. This small room would qualify as a sitting room
if only there was some furniture to sit on. The walls are devoid of
ornamentation and have a well-worn appearance. 
This room is illuminated. Obvious exits: east west.

Dust-covered tomes fill shelves from the floor to the ceiling,

Xavier says, "Someone has been here."
Xavier removes a tome entitled, "Garronte Lost."
The bookcase swings silently open.
You follow Xavier through a bookshelf...
The area brightens.
Surveying this tiny hidden room reveals many rare works including
'Garlidan's clues for the Clueless' , 'The Fang' by Rhrangkhorre,
'Secrets of Spur' by Loremaster, an Autobiography titled 'Im not a
Demon! And a Bio titled 'Sure he is!
This room is illuminated. Obvious exits: None.
Xavier replaces the book and the case swings shut.
Xavier says, "I definitely detect a presence here."
Xavier frowns.
Xavier says, "Someone has been trespassing within my home!"
You follow Xavier through an open trapdoor...
The area brightens.
This narrow passage is a secret means of going from the library to
the cellar. Obviously the secret is out. You can hear the slow drip
of water somewhere as rats scurry in the shadows. There is a ladder
leading up to a trapdoor here.  A closed red door is here. This
room is illuminated. Obvious exits: north.
Xavier says, "no"
Xavier just opened the closed red door.
You follow Xavier through an open red door...
This chilly room is free from dust and debris. The jet black floor

Xavier curses.
Xavier just closed the open red door.
Xavier swings his grey steel rapier at the werewolf!
	The 1st swing is an amazing blow to the left leg.

The 2nd swing is a well delivered blow to the head, but is
easily sidestepped.

				The 3rd swing is a perfect blow to the head.
		The werewolf is knocked back!
The werewolf just died.
Xavier frowns.
Xavier says, "that was a servant"
Xavier says, "something else is here, do you feel it?" Xavier waves his arm 
and a fine black mist settles about the room. A	pair of glowing footprints 
appear.
Xavier drifts to the prints and utters something unintelligible. An
image forms of a demonic figure with San features.
Xavier says, "aha!"
Jascye says, "BAH a Sanene!"
Xavier says, "It's spoor remains"
Xavier says, "this demon thinks to usurp my home?"
Xavier smiles icily.
Xavier says, "I will discover its name, and when I do... I shall
have a new slave."
Xavier says, "Come, lets leave this place, I will set a trap, but
I do not want this thing to suspect I know he is here."
Xavier just opened the closed red door.
Xavier waves his hand and the prints fade.

First glance at this room would seem to indicate the site of a cave
in, but on closer examination the piles of dirt here seem to be
hasty graves. As you look closer it appears that the dirt is moving. 
This room is illuminated. Obvious exits: east south.
Xavier says, "You wished to see the cellars."
You follow Xavier east...
The rusty metal contraptions lying about this room indicate it was
once used for torturing poor souls. You strongly sense that the
residing spirits here want revenge on the living.  A closed door is
here. This room is illuminated.Obvious exits: west.
Xavier just opened the closed door.
You follow Xavier through an open door...
You are surrounded by racks and racks of wine bottles, and the

Xavier floats up through a trapdoor in the ceiling.
You follow Xavier through an open trapdoor...

This room is illuminated. Obvious exits: south west. 
Xavier says, "the kitchen"
You follow Xavier west...

Xavier says, "They caught us by surprise."
Xavier shrugs.
Xavier says, "I am surprised they didn't take the silver... but
then few left the mansion anyway."
You follow Xavier west...
The furniture here in the Parlor was once of the highest quality,
but now looks like things of various sizes have been gnawing on it
for a good while. A neglected wet bar sits to the side.  A bar and
an open mahogany door are here. This room is illuminated. Obvious

You have reached a stairwell whose creaky steps wind their way up
a dark turret. You can hear the wind whistling through an opening
far above. This room is illuminated. Obvious exits: southeast.
You follow Xavier through a stone stairs...
The small, barred window gives you a tantalizing taste of freedom.
The wind whistles shrilly through a broken pane. The back of a
tapestry acts as a door to a room to the west.  A stairs is here.
This room is illuminated. Obvious exits: None.
You follow Xavier through a tapestries...
Against the north wall rests a crooked desk, the papers sitting on

and brown. This room is illuminated. Obvious exits: south.

Dark liquid runs down the walls of this hallway. A chill breeze
whisks through, bringing with it a fetid smell. You can hear a
scratching in the distance. There is a door in the eastern wall.
You follow Xavier west...
Except for the squeaky floor, the upstairs is ominously quiet.
Several bedroom doors are here. You suspect this is not the place
to bring that special person you know for a relaxing interlude.  A
stairs is here. This room is illuminated. Obvious exits: east.
You follow Xavier through a stairs...
The dark, dusky entryway gives you the impression that no one has
lived in the house for years. Two suits of armor with crossed
halberds guard an archway to the east.  An open oak door, an open
wood door, an open mahogany door, an archway, and a stairs are
here. This room is illuminated. Obvious exits: None.
Xavier says, "once again, the foyer."
Xavier says, "Now there is one place I haven't yet shown you.."
Xavier says, "in fact, it has been closed for many many years."
Xavier says, "I did not wish it to be despoiled by the invaders."
You follow Xavier through a stairs.

	
  Xavier then lead ma to tha grand ballroom.  Ye can find it through the 
arch here then toward the east is a glowin door.  That door has some form of 
magick afixed to it fer all undead past this point canna be attacked and 
will nah attack ye.  Perhaps Xavier wanted a place to get away from his 
eternal battle and so made a place for everyone.  He did not speak much of 
the past beyond this point so I will simply chronicle what I found in the 
rest of the mansion.  The first room past the Glowing black door was full 
of skeletons.  The stairs here lead to the balcony where many greater 
undead can be seen but again are surrounded by some docile aura.  There is 
also a set of stairs on the balcony which leads ta a back exit from the 
mansion
  If'n one heads east from the Skeleton room there is another set of stairs 
which leads to a the main ballroom.  Down there is a crypt and tha undead 
orchestras pit.  Many baubles lay about the floors here but are afixed in 
place and only the unwise would steal from one such as Xavier.  If his 
spirit still lingers.  To the north through a door is a gate that remains 
locked and to this point is unlockable except perhaps by some magickal 
means.  Xavier vanished abruptly after showing me this area. During the 
remainder of the tour, he had been silent. His final words to me though 
were that I would most likely never see him again. Truth be told, I can 
only hope that he is right.

  Who was Xavier?  He gave many clues in his tour.  The entire town rose 
against him.  Was it a big misunderstanding or did he cause some ill will 
toward this Lady he spoke of?  Or was it out of the common jealousy that 
many races hold fer a Frontacians raw magickal talent?
  I canna answer these questions and can only speculate like the rest.  
I did come to learn e'en the tour tha Xavier has become a Muatana-Al.  He 
must have made this transformation willingly to fend off the invaders.  I 
am only happy tha Xavier found some other form of sustinance or I would 
surely ave been his next meal.  With all of the power that Xavier seems to 
hold why would he focus on twisting his house rather then protecting his 
dear ones?  

  In many subsequent journies back ta tha mansion I have been unable to 
find many of the places that Xavier took me.  I have mapped what I could 
of tha dwellin.  I can however warn those of what creatures ye'll find in 
the bode.  The whole main foyer area is ruled by Shades, Greater Spirits, 
Ghouls, Ghasts and other undead. They are na exceedingly common, at least 
na to the degree that they are near the ballroom.  Upstairs an occassional 
Assassin, Spirit and Wraith leaps from the shadows at passersby deliverin 
crishin blows to those they hit.  Through the first door at the bottom of 
the stairs Xavier's Aunt's pets still live...  Or at least their spawn 
still do.  All sorts of animals will pounce on any tha stop to rest here.
  If one finds the room upstairs where Xavier mentioned the master of the 
ville still rests e the bed there,  to the east is a closet that is full of 
skeletons of the mana towns people struck down by Xavier.  Tis a small room 
and na well ventilated so leave yuir Familiars outside.
  The final place I will mention is the area of the wine cellar. Mana, 
mana spirits haunt tha area through the hidden door.  They are joined by 
yuir assorement of rats and yuir occasional troll.

I hope this information helps all survive the haunted house and put a few 
undead spirits to rest in mah name.  If any find problem with the map I 
have provided please let me know so I ken fix it.  I havna mapped evera 
square inch of the place and not even everywhere that Xavier went on his 
tour but most of it is here and I leave the rest to adventure.
(Editor's note: The Map can be found under the heading DFCMap_1. It was not
included with this issue, due to the towns Print office being unable to 
handle anything other than dry text.)

                                   Music


  Power and energy come in forms that are infinitely diverse, and all life 
is equipped to drain every last ounce, vampirically, from the source, no 
matter how strange or nebulous its shape. For Hullian Bulloofern, a typical 
young Secian, this was especially true of music. She knew that music held 
great power, even if she never rationalized it that clearly.
  She was a healer, as are many of her race, and she spent many hours 
wandering the Spur, healing those who had been hurt in the pursuit of money 
or gems. They too, were after power, though they did not have Hullian's gift 
for finding it in any scrap of melody. Whether it be from the giant, 
bellow-pumped organ near the altar in the temple of Taath, or in the wind 
through a copse of trees, Hullian could find the music, and through it, her
power. She would often rest from the ardourous profession of bringing 
health to the injured by sitting in the Bard's hall, listening raptly. 
The bards loved her, for she would clap happily for any song, no matter how 
incompetently it was produced. The apprentices cherished her especially, for
her enthusiastic approval lifted their spirits when they grew discouraged 
with their progress, or lack thereof.
  Her patients noticed that she would hum to herself when treating a 
particularly tough, or deep, wound. Her pleasant contralto, by no means 
spectacular, but still harmonious, never quite ceased in its' tuneless 
meandering. When she seemed depressed, or especially tired, her friends 
would often drag her to a performance, hoping to raise her spirits. Most 
telling of all, the pendant she received from Taath was in the shape of a 
flute.
  Energy flowed into Hullian and out of her fingertips into her patients. 
Within mere months, she had gained such favor with her god that even the 
power to bring dead adventurers to life was granted her. For weeks this 
kept her busy to, and beyond, the point of exhaustion. This endless cycle 
of healing and resurrection eventually calmed down as people began to 
learn to be more safe. The calls gradually lessened, and Hullian spent most 
of her time in the center of the Spur, casting healing spells.
  One day, however, a call came from deep within the Mansion in the Noble 
district. It was a telepathic cry for help, laden with grief and panic. 
Hullian would have ignored such a call, for the house northwest of the 
Gilded Lion Inn was filled with all manner of unclean creatures. But the one
in trouble was a dragon, and she had to go.
  As she traveled quickly, her tiny wings carrying her as fast as she could 
make them, she tried not to dwell on what she might find there. Taath was 
the god of Death, but some creatures defied death in evil and twisted ways, 
living past their rightful time, feeding on the energy of the living to 
exist. The concept of these creatures frightened Hullian, for she used her 
energy to preserve life, not distort and destroy it.
  The house barely impinged on her consciousness as she rushed up the stairs
to where the fallen dragon lay. She prayed to Taath loudly, and in moments, 
the noble beast was alive once again. She cast several healing spells, and 
concentrated, focusing on healing its' wounds. So engrossed in her work, 
she didn't notice the spirit that had floated out of the wall behind her. 
It raised its' claws, preparing to strike to diminutive healer down.
  The dragon leaped to its' feet with a roar, and began to claw viscously 
at the attacker. Berserk with rage, it sought only to protect the little 
one. Intent on saving both of them, it didn't notice that Hullian was 
standing still, listening carefully to the sounds of the drafty, creaking 
house. As it clawed the undead life from the spirit, Hullian slipped quietly
through a hidden doorway.
  She didn't see anything. Her lack of perception was no longer based on 
fear. She was listening to a melody, and her other senses had shut off, so 
that her ears might concentrate fully. The song was one of power, and life, 
and she could not resist its' call. It made her entire skin thrum with 
energy, and she knew if she learned that song, power would be hers. 
Eagerly, her feet flew across the floorboards, hurtling her towards the 
source of the sound.
  As she turned the corner, she realized her myopic devotion to music had 
deceived her. The power of the song was irresistible, but it was not hers 
to posses. It came from one who used music to defy the fabric of the world. 
It came from one who hated the music, even as she used it, not one who loved
it, as Hullian did. In her arrogance, she thought that she was the only one 
who could draw power from music. Now she would learn from that mistake. 
With a sigh of resignation, full of regret, Hullian closed her eyes and 
waited for the banshee to embrace her.

By: Michael the Dragon

"From the earth, up through the trees, 
I can hear her calling me. 
Her voice, rides on the breeze,
A scent that intoxicates, come see."

No, can't get away..I cannot take the pain. I am in misery.
My blood runs cold, as I feel my life bleed away.
The claws, they rend my very being...tearing and ripping me apart.

Through tooth and nail, I shall pledge to thee
For the Honor of another, I shall die for thee
For the Wealth of mine, it shall never compare
For the Heart is dropped in dispair.

For the Ring that will call him,
For the Ring that will bind him,
For the Ring that will burn him,
Unto darkness descend he.

Black was his Heart,
Blackend was his Soul,
Light is her Flame, 
Lighting his way home." @)>--'--,---

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Strength Within

There is a point
At which you can go no further.
You cannot lift another step;
You cannot force your arms against the current;
You cannot suck air into your chest one more time.
Your fingers slip;
You cannot hold on--
And you know that
If you are to live--
To survive--
There is an instant;
A second;
A minute;
--A breath;
Or a struggle;
And a terror eats your gut like acid.
And when there is nothing left
With which to fight,
That
Is where fear fails
And courage begins.

  Wellcome to another edition of Rise of the classes. Little movement was 
seen amongst the various guilds since our last issue. In the Bards, Augustus
the Anthian has surpassed Prince Serenity. Perhaps Augustus does not yet 
realize just how unable to function his poor Guild currently is. Amongst the 
Fighters, Tohr Kreen seems to have taken a major drubbing, falling from 
3rd rank to 5th. Perhaps you should stop hunting those Yelicans Tohr. 
  The Barbarians experienced little change. Exchanging one Arachnian in 
their 5th spot for another. The senior most leadership remained constant. 
The Thieves, with their usual backstabbing, have a new force to be
reckoned with. Coming up to claim the number 2 slot, Dashe the Goblin seems
to be one that bears watching. In the Sword Clerics guild, we see newcomer
Saltine Kracker coming to bear the third Rank. Saltine is, of all races, 
a Flerian. Devoted to the Gods though, I would say he is another to be 
reckoned with. 
  The Foresters, reflecting there natural serenity I suppose, had no 
movement within their top 5. Jascye Fir Elf still retains the top spot in 
that most honorable of Guilds. In the Heart Clerics, Dragonfly still seems 
to dominate. Her healing powers are unsurpassed by any in the land. As you 
can see, Secians also continue in their traditional role, holding 4 of the
top 5 guild slots in this peaceful Group. 
  The Hand Clerics were the only one to exchange Guildmasters this period.
Dnara Hessenth's hold on the top was finally broken by Lorelei 
Nilsfulcentruali. Other than this exchange, the Hand Clerics have remained
stable. It remains to be seen where the Guild will go under its new 
leadership. 
  Finally we have the Runemages Guild. The Thuggian brothers Crunch and 
Gristle further strengthened their hold on the Guild, with Crunch pushing
past Skratchnar for the number 3 slot. If I was Ragarn Lazlo, I would 
definetly be a bit worried about running into those two ambitious Mages
in a dark alley.
