============================================================================
(Editor's note: Most of my letter is OOC: sicne it deals primarily with issues pertaining to future operations of the DFC. I hope you will all not find it to painful to read through. -Rags)

  Once again we at the DFC would like to present another issue for your perusal. Things have been heating up in the lands recently. In the intrest of keeping our readers informed, we have decided to begin bringing you News of events and happenings in this world of ours. Since this is our first issue bringing you the news, I must confess that our reporting is a little light. Hopefuly, as time goes on, we will be able to bring you all the important events which occur each month. I can't do it without your help though. Contrary to popular belief, I am not in the realm 24 hours a day. Since I can not be there for every invasion, plot twist, quest, or story line....I must rely on reporters for the DFC. So, if you should happen to be involved in something of newsworthiness, send me a capture of the event. The E-mail should clearly state what it is a capture of, as well as any important details you think I should know. These captures will be gone over by either me or one of the other staff, and we will report to you the citizens on whats going on. Since I intend to give Word Count to any whos captures I use, please put your SN at the begining of each file. Finally, let me note that I will be working on a first send first credit basis. In other words, whomever gets me a capture of an event first will be the one eligible for Word Count should I use said capture. 
  In addition, should you be interested in becoming a full time reporter, let me know. All that is required is that you be active in the realm, and be willing to make a deadline. Reporters will be required to give me notice through E-mail when they are working on a story. In other words, they should let me know after being involved in a particular adventure that they will be writting about it. This will of course save me from going through captures of an event in order to report on something they are already working on. I only plan to have a limited number of reporters on staff though, and experience in the realm is a definet plus. Keep in mind that I retain the right to dismiss reporters should they be unable to meet deadline, or should they be unable to spend enough time involved in events in the Spur to keep me supplied with news. 
  I hope you will all help us here at the DFC to make upcoming issues more informative and interesting than ever before. And, without further ado, on to the articles.

                         News of the Spur

  In a recent crisis, Taath once again proved that his cruelty knows no bounds. Kulric, high priest of Taath, came to that Dark Gods temple and demanded a sacrifice. Commanding the temple bells wrung, he sent his followers out in search of a Fir Elf by the name of Sarainelle. Though relatively unknown throughout the land, Sarainelle was reputed to be a gentle and kind soul. She was finally tracked down by Yornan, a self styled Shadow Master of The Dark God. Yornan dragged her back to his temple, and threw her before Kuric and his followers. Her Arms and legs bound by shackles, she was unable to do more than cry out for help. Strangely, non of the various "heroes" of the Spur raised so much as a finger to stop her from being dragged through the streets....though many were able to hear her screams of terror. Some did come to the temple and try to stop this action. Chief amongst them were Lthe the Leuian, Dirke the Anthian, Vincie the Frontacian, and Goneforever the Penthanian. There were a few other non-Taathians, but according to reports these folk did not join in the struggle against the Dark ones followers.
  Of course, these poor folk did not stand much of a chance against the power arrayed against them. Mordassa and Yornan were able to quickly decimate those who would intterupt there sacred proceedings using that awesome power of Taath, The Smite. Swiftsilk the Arachnian and Jhered the San Elf landed a few blows on the interlopers, to keep them distracted while the priests readied there prayers one must assume. In the end, nothing could stop Kuric from plunging the sacrifical dagger into Sarainelle's chest. Her soul was given over to Taath, and her head was hung up atop the city walls. City Guards were ordered to remove the head later that night, but fearing the wrath of Taath, they left it to rot there. Sarainelle's once pretty features now serve as food for the ravens.....

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  In related news, Jhered the San Elf has reputedly been seduced by the power of Taath. Once a follower of UnKnown, this San seems to have given in to his bloody nature, and joined the followers of the Dark God. According to witnesses, Jhered was brought over to the Dark God by none other than Taath's high priest, Kulric himself. As Taaths power seems to grow further each day, we at the DFC have to wonder if there will be anyone left to stand against the depravations these killers practice in the name of their religion.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  On a slightly more pleasant note, the fabeled Swords of SA have once again turned up in the Spur. Some of you may remember these blades named Paranor and Morinod which were once wielded by champions of Spur whose name they bear. These blades, one white, and one black, are believed to be dedicated to the powers of Order and Chaos. They serve the Mystical God of Magick above all though. They have been given into the keeping of two of Spurs finest, Jinko and Kalys. Hopefuly these two are well entrusted to help defend the city should its moment of need arrive. 
  In addition, we must report that the third sword, the Grey one is now resting in Town Square, defying anyone to lift it. According to the high priest who presented the blades to Kalys and Jinko, the Grey blade has not yet awakened. What that means, we here at the DFC do not know. Some of the older Spurians may remember that blade as the one belonging to Kralen the self proclaimed Grey Man of SA. Perhaps it awaits his return, as he once promised it would.....

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  A new threat manifested itself in the Spur on the 14th of February in the world outside ours. Seemingly appearing out of nowhere, a Leuian by the name of Modassa Terl arrived to lay waste to three of the Spurs most powerful citizens. This Leuian was able to attack and kill Jale, Inkha, and Symbus using that horrific prayer Smite. According to witnesses though, this new Leuian interloper was not a member of the Taathian clergy. He did not even follow the Dark God. Are the other Gods begining to respond by granting Smite to there followers? Will we see a new increase in the number of beings able to master this method of death? I can only hope that the Gods are wiser than that....

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  February 22nd in the world outside saw the return of Soros to once again plague our fair city. Accompained by his normal host of Sccravixx, he first attacked Town Square. Meeting stiff resistance there, he moved his attack to the Temple of SA, while still leaving enough of his minions to keep many of the defenders occupied. There Soros was finally beaten back by a large group which had gathered to defend SA's altar. Unfortunately, he was not killed untill after he had succesfuly claimed a number of lives through his powerful Fire Storm spells. 
  After being slain, Soros was able to defy death...and came back once more. Since it is obvious that no God would help to bring this monster back to life...it can only be assumed that Soros has found some other means to extend his existance. One can not help but be drawn to this conclusion when presented with Soros raving about his immortality to any who would listen. 
  Escaping from the defenders of SA, Soros then ran to attack the temple of Elindale. There, he was seemingly joined by a Muatan-al named Darkreave. Darkreave presented little threat to the group which had gathered to protect Elindale...and was soon minus a rather essential piece of his anatomy. Namely his head. Also there was a Human named Dozrada Soros. One can only guess what his possible connection can be with all this. He seemed to be a being of fair power though. Before he could be further questioned though, he disapeared under unusual circumstances.

Now, we can only wait and see what Soros shall do next.

The Gladiator of the Month

Unfortunately, I was unable to find Jale running around in the Spur.  Be sure to look for the inevitable interview with this powerful birdie in the next issue of the DFC.  I'd also like to express my apologies to both Acinonyx and Jale for the previous interview with Acinonyx.  Unfortunately, some of the content should not have been put into print, and apologize outright for my actions.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

(Editor's note: In lieu of an interview with Spur's top Gladiator this month, we present you with this informative interview regarding the upcoming Spurrian Gladiator's association)

	I left home the other day with a note from Karnage that he'd like to speak to the DFC about the new type of games coming out.  We met at the Rose Tavern in the Merchant's Circle.
	It was strange when I entered the Tavern, everyone was making sure to keep their distance from the table in the far right corner of the room.  As I approached, I noticed Acinonyx and Karnage in a heated debate over webbing tactics, hidden opponents, and something about a particular glower that needed to continuously be ganged up on.  A large cave troll stood close by, unaware of the two debaters, glowering darkly at the Tavern's patrons.  I smiled as I approached, took out my handy magick autoscriber, and started this interview:
 
Milanden says, "Hello, this is...uh..."

Milanden blinks.

Milanden says, "With the DragonsFire Chronicle, I'm here with Karnage and Acinonyx."

Milanden says, "The founders of the SGA, or Spurian Gladiators Association."

Milanden says, "There's been alot of hype about this upcoming event."

Milanden says, "I, for one, am very interested in the way things will work in SGA, rather than the Governor's Games."

Milanden says, "Could you give us the basic information on what SGA is all about?"

The cave troll says, "Karnage says that the SGA is a league of racial teams"

The cave troll says, "Karnage says that Every race, every person in Spur can join a team"

The cave troll says, "Karnage says that the teams will be made up of eight people"

	(Editor's Note: The teams can now have 12 members, 8 playing, 4 	substituting -Rags)

Milanden nods.
The cave troll says, "Karnage says that some races might not even have one team, some might have 5 or 6"

Milanden says, "And these eight people must be of the same race, correct?"

The cave troll says, "Karnage says yes"

The cave troll says, "Karnage says all the same race"

Acinonyx says, "There will be an entrance fee for each team."

Acinonyx says, "400k a team for 50k a person."

Milanden says, "Are there any regulations on how the teams are made up? Can the Spurians pick what team they wish to be on?"

Acinonyx mutters something beneath her breath.

Acinonyx says, "Each race can make their own team..."

Acinonyx says, "8 friends of one race may come together..."

Acinonyx says, "They chose a captain."

Milanden nods.

Acinonyx says, "If there is 16 of one race who wish to participate, then there will be 2 teams of that race"

Milanden nods.

Milanden says, "And the amount is so that the new Spurians won't be able to get in with the big boys?"

The cave troll says, "Karnage says that and for use of the arena and rezzes"
 
Acinonyx says, "New Spurians can participate if they wish...if they have a team."

Milanden smiles.

Acinonyx says, "The fee is to curb attendance as well."
 
Karnage nods.

Milanden says, "Are there any special rules, or are they like the Governor's Games rules?"

The cave troll says, "Karnage says that all the rules of the Governors games,pluse no pray hide, no lights."

Milanden says, "No lights?"

The cave troll says, "Karnage says that's correct"

Milanden says, "As in completely darken the arena?"

The cave troll says, "Karnage says that it will be lighted, so no lights will be needed"

Milanden nods.

Acinonyx says, "Too much glare"

The cave troll says, "Karnage says that they don't want the rooms to get smokie"

The cave troll says, "Karnage says that because I can only watch a torch flicker so many times before I go nuts"
 
Milanden says, "Hmm...is there a point system in these games?"

Acinonyx nods at Milanden.
 
Acinonyx says, "For each person your team falls you get 10 points."
 
Acinonyx says, "You have a 30 minute time limit for each game...if all 8 of your advesaries have not fallen by the end of the time limit then the winner goes to the one with the most points."

Acinonyx says, "If by chance that comes to a tie, then it will be a draw."

Milanden says, "Okay, is there any type of prize involved? A wand that invokes a Flying Death Skull or something?"

The cave troll says, "Karnage says that the season will last 3 months, with a playoffs at the end of the season"

The cave troll says, "Karnage says that there will be a prize"

Milanden says, "This SGA sounds like something else, for the DFC and everyone.  It'd be a good conversation piece."

Milanden says, "Are the teams expected to pick names for themselves?"

Acinonyx nods.

Milanden says, "What about certain races that are rare to the Spur? Will it be possible for a 'mixed' team?"
 
The cave troll says, "Karnage says that as of right now we don't plan to have a mixed team for the small races"

The cave troll says, "Karnage says that it may be possible, due to the rarities of some of the races of the Spur"

Milanden says, "After that one, I'd like to know why it must be racial teams?"

Acinonyx says, "We're trying to emphasize racial cohesivness."

The cave troll says, "Karnage says that we are trying to bring races together, as they should be"

Acinonyx says, "This way...each race will learn to work together among themselves."

Karnage nods.

Acinonyx says, "This will require communication among each team..."

Acinonyx says, "This will also prevent the teams from becoming top-heavy"

Milanden says, "Top heavy?"

Acinonyx says, "If we allowed mixed teams with the best people, it would be You, Marakos, Ragarn, Gristle, Jale...etc all on one team"

Milanden says, "When will the games start?"

Acinonyx says, "Next Monday, the 3rd, we're planning on having the opening ceremonies."

	(Editor's Note: The games have been pushed back a week so the Spur 	can formulate teams. -Rags)


Acinonyx says, "This is where one would introduce their team..."

Acinonyx says, "And pay their fee..."

Acinonyx says, "The first games would start the following Monday, the 10th."

	(Editor's Note: The first game has been pushed back a week so the 	Spur can formulate teams.  Monday the 10th will be the opening 	ceremonies. -Rags)


Acinonyx says, "And..."

Acinonyx says, "You must be at the opening ceremonies to participate."
 
Acinonyx says, "Time to be announced."

Milanden says, "Oh, how many games will be running per MONDAY night?"

The cave troll says, "Karnage says that 4 games at a time will be running"

The cave troll says, "Karnage says that so each team will have more than one game"

The cave troll says, "Karnage says which means 8 teams will be playing at once"

Milanden says, "In all corners of the rooms? Kinda like a one room FFA?"

The cave troll says, "Karnage says that each team will have more than just one game a night"

The cave troll says, "Karnage says kinda like 3 room FFA"

Milanden says, "Thank you, you two, I'm honored to be the one to interview you on the SGA"

                    INTERVIEW WITH A MASTER-TAILOR 


I had the honor and pleasure of speaking at length with Rehas Othello about  
his life and travels in Spur.  Curious about his craft, here's what I learned during my conversation with this illustrious and talented artisan-tailor. 
 
Allandra readies a gold-tipped turquoise quill and unfurls a yellowing scroll. 

Allandra smiles, and curtsies to Rehas. 

Rehas smiles, and bows. 

Allandra says,  "M'lord Rehas, if I may, perhaps we can go right to the heart of the matter.  Would you be kind enough to tell me about your ancestry, and your early life before you arrived in our fair Spur?" 

Rehas says with a smile,  "Why, certainly.  After all, I'm not all human." 

Allandra raises an eyebrow, and says, "Really?  How fascinating." 

Rehas says, "Yes, well, my father was a human sailor;  my mother, a Frontacian." 

Allandra asks,  "Hmmm....royal lineage?" 

Rehas sighs, and says, "Not royalty;  she was of the merchant class, and my  
father, a bit of a rogue.  But as a boy, I managed to see many wondrous lands.  In fact, that is how I made most of my present day business connections." 

Allandra smiles and says, "Do go on." 

Rehas continues, "Well, my father, although being a rogue of sorts, had a silver tongue.  I don't recall much of my mother;  she died when I was very young." 

Allandra says, "How awfully sad." 

Rehas nods, and continues,  "My father was known to have many children at  
several ports-of-call.  I was more or less raised by a nanny, and sent to the finest schools in the realm.   I know of some of my brothers and sisters, but I do believe there are many I'm not aware of." 

Rehas says, "In my teen years, I travelled extensively with my father for his business, which I'm not afraid to say was in black market goods.  He made a good living, and in time, I was following in his footsteps."

Allandra listens intently as she scribbles on the scroll, the quill making a light scratching sound against the yellowed parchment. 

Rehas says,  "At length, we travelled to Moldavia, on a trip to smuggle some 
herbs and vials.  Alas, the residents of the land were tipped off, my father was arrested, and subsequently hung at the gallows." 

Allandra gasps. 

Rehas nods, and says, "And I, myself, spent the next  5 years in a dungeon cell." 

Allandra looks at Rehas sympathetically. 

Rehas asks, "You know who the residents of Moldavia are, yes?" 

Allandra shakes her head from side to side and says, "Well, actually, no...." 

Rehas smiles and says, "It is the land of the pale ones.........the Muatana-al." 

Allandra gasps.
 
Rehas explains,  "Yes, I lived in daily fear, until I discovered something little known.   I never realized how old their culture is, nor how smart they really are.  In time,  I was sold to a Muatana-al noble, who added the final touches to my education.  It seems he did not wish some drooling human making a scene at one of his dinner parties.  Eventually, I became as one of his children and was released from my servanthood.   Mind you, I remained in Moldavia for many years." 

Rehas continues, "I labored night and day, and used my gold to start REHAS  
INC., which now has outlets at almost every civilized port-of-call." 

Rehas winks. 

Allandra smiles mischievously, and says,  "What spurred you on (pardon the  
pun) to master the art of tailoring and design creation?" 

Rehas chuckles, and says, "Well, actually, the Muatana-al are very fancy  
dressers.  My tailoring arose from the strict requirements they sought of me. Mind you, they'd probably eject me from the guild for some of the work I've done here, though." 

Rehas sighs.


Allandra shakes her head from side to side and says, "I must say, your creations are exquisite.  I'm quite sure the Muatana-al would agree.  But perhaps now you can tell me what the early days were like for you here in Spur, trying to establish your business?" 

Rehas nods, and says, "It was difficult, but I had a large pool of resources which helped to grease the palms of the tax collectors and local oliticians.  The shop alone cost me.....and zoning laws.....as you can surmise, it wasn't easy. 

Rehas adds,  "But I had a much harder time when I set up shop in Leuia." 

Allandra raises an eyebrow and says, "Do tell." 

Rehas says, "Well, they have tight trading regulations.....and the entire honor thing....it was supremely difficult.  No khats wished to work for me. Not only that,  but they wanted 30% on all my sales, for taxes." 

Rehas snorts. 

Allandra says,  "How unfortunate.  Barely a cactus grows in a parched desert." 

Rehas nods, and says, "But then again, a business thrives on gold, if you know what I mean." 

Rehas winks. 

Rehas adds,  "As an aside, I would never have agreed to an interview with  
anyone else but yourself.  I tend to be tight-lipped at times." 

Allandra blinks, and says with a chuckle, "How fortunate, then, for me, and how perceptive of my Editor-in-Chief."  

Rehas sips some elvyn-wine and says, "Next question?" 

Allandra smiles and says, "Ahhh, yes....can you tell me of anything that aided your craft, and the fame you're now known for?" 

Rehas says,  "Well...I have 3 wonderful employees who can take orders to fit the needs of the public.  And of course, a worthy distributor who makes weekly shipments from my warehouse operation.  I take the business end of just-in-time inventory.  I would also like to add that people here have been wonderful and taken to my shop famously.   And not to mention......" 

Rehas smiles warmly and says, "..........my most incredibly lovely model, Allandra  Shadowfax." 

Allandra blushes and says, "I'm honored.  A pleasure to wear your creations." 

Rehas says with a smile, "Well, I'd have to say you're the driving force behind the rush of business I've had.  I should simply put your name in lights, as the reason behind much of my success." 

Allandra blushes again, and says, "It's the least I can do, to assist your work."  

Allandra coughs, then clears her throat and continues, "Forgive me for prying, but would you kindly enlighten those of us with a burning desire to know all, exactly which wonderful items you craft?   Oh, and relative price ranges, if you don't mind.  Just in general, of course." 

Rehas grins and says, "Hmmm....well, most normal items such as pants, shirts, helms, shields, and jewelry, are around 10K each.  Light sources, capes, and  other novelty items also run 10K.  Prices do vary for specialty weapons and armor.  The more you pay, the better the quality, of course." 

Rehas winks. 

Allandra grins and says, "Why, of course..........Now, is there any one item that particularly stands out in your mind, of which you're especially proud?" 

Rehas coughs and says,  "Hmmm...well, you do ask some tough questions.  Let me see....I would have to say I'm very proud to have been able to provide the means of keeping the Spur in music and poetry, with the Recitals." 

Allandra beams, and says,  "Yes, a philanthropic cause.  I must concur, 'tis a gratifying  enterprise.......Oh, and in reference to your work, I've taken advantage of your artistry and always been pleased beyond compare.   I can attest to its supreme quality." 

Rehas smiles graciously. 

Allandra asks,  "M'lord Rehas, is there anything of import that I've missed, that you wish to share with us now?" 

Rehas smiles, and says,  "Only that I've enjoyed how you have all helped me get started.  Despite rough beginnings, things are getting better.....And also that, perhaps someday,  I will have a manor built here, and raise my family." 

Allandra says,  "Ahhh....a very warm and worthy aspiration." 

Rehas says,  "Well, even a merchant has dreams."

Suddenly,  Rehas smiles and says,  "Oh, and let me add.......I am single, but my heart is lost to a very beautiful person, whom I wish to keep anonymous." 

Allandra blinks,  coughs,  then clears her throat and says,  "Well, m'lord Rehas,  I sincerely thank you for your valuable time and  candor.  Our interview is now concluded.   I wish you continued success and acclaim in Spur, and eagerly anticipate your next creation." 

Allandra smiles and curtsies to Rehas. 

Rehas smiles and bows to Allandra. 
 
Thus my interview with Rehas Othello ended.  Deep in thought, I envisioned my  next encounter with this famous Master-tailor, in hopes of acquiring yet another divine ensemble for future Bardic Recitals.

A Healer's Primer


Preface

Greetings, friend.  If you are reading this, then you have probably chosen the rewarding profession of a Heart Cleric.  If you haven't yet chosen a profession, then I warn you;  the life of a heart cleric is not for everyone.  It can be very rewarding, yet it can also be very trying and dangerous.  We are often called upon to venture into the most dangerous areas to ply our trade, and, since, we have pledged to always endeavor to avoid the harming of sentient life, we are at a serious disadvantage when set upon by unfriendly citizens.  However, the rewards are great as well.  We are, next to runemages, perhaps the greatest magick wielders in the land, and are, without peer, the greatest healers.  So, my friend, read on and learn of our profession.  If you choose to join us, then I will be happy to call you brother.

In Peace,
Monticath Allimair
Healer of Sa


The Basics of Healing

The first question voiced by most new heart clerics is, "How do I heal?"  A simple question that can have a multitude of answers.  First off, let us deal with how you know someone needs healing.  Other then the obvious method of someone staggering towards you, and gasping for help.  The way to do this is to DIAGNOSE people you meet.  Diagnosing someone allows you to look at them and judge their physical well-being.  When you perform this action you will be able to tell if someone is wounded, weakened from previous hurts, or tired, and to what extent.  For example, let's us say that Yornok, a Thugian, walks into the area where you are.  Well, when you DIAGnose Yornok, you may know that he has: a small infected wound on his right leg, pale, and nearly exhausted.  Yornok definitely needs healing.

Now, there are several ways you can go about this, but our primary method of healing is done by LAYing HANDS on the afflicted.  However, before you can do this Yornok must be sitting, or lying down.  Leading us to the first thing a healer usually says to someone they first meet.  It's not hello; it's usually, "Sit down, please".  After your patient sits down you can then apply your healing touch.  Simply LAY HANDS ON Yornok.  The healing power of your god will be channeled through you, and into the body of the patient.  By calling for this healing power from your god, you put yourself into a semi-trance state that can last upwards of 20 seconds.  While healing this way, both you and your patient will be unable to perform any, but the simplest of actions, such as talking.  You will not be able to move, invoke spells, or fight; you will also notice that you will tire by doing this.  Don't worry, as you become more proficient at calling the healing power from your god, this delay will shorten until you are so practiced that it takes but the blink of an eye.  Secondly, your god may not always answer your call; don't despair, as you advance in the healing arts your power to heal will become more reliable.  The laying of hands will restore your patient, at least partially, to health.  You may apply this treatment as many times as necessary.  The amount of benefit the patient receives is dependent on your standing with your god, and how tired you are, as each portion of health restored saps some of your strength.

Another method of healing is the use of the First Aid skill.  This skill allows you bind and heal wounds, and will also restore some health back to the recipient.  This skill is quite difficult to use effectively when you first learn it.  Each attempt with this skill takes time, during which you can not perform other complex actions.  A major difference is that the First Aid skill does not send the recipient into a semi-trance state.  They can still fight, albeit from a seated or prone position, while being treated in this manner.  Unlike the laying of hands, however, this remedy can only be applied once for each patient.  Once you successfully treat someone with First Aid, you will be unable to help someone with this skill again unless they are further wounded by another attack.

A further method of healing is available to all members of the Secian race.  They have the ability of empathic healing.  Merely by touching a wounded person, they can transfer a wound to themselves. The recipient of this healing will not regain any health or fatigue, but they will no longer be further weakened by the wound.  Using poor Yornok again, a Secian could heal him by touching him and TRANSFERring WOUND from Yornok.  Secians can use this ability as often as they like.  Care should be taken however to carefully keep track of your own health; as it is possible for a secian to die due to taking on more wounds then their accelerated healing rate can compensate for.


The Use of Runes

You can also heal people through the careful application of rune spells.  As a new heart cleric you are gifted with the following runes:  Elements:  Heal, Vigor, Strength, Comfort, and Fire; Shapes: GodShape (i.e. Dragon, Tiger, Dove...); Modifiers: Small and Average.  From these runes, four healing spells may be wrought.  This is done by WEAVEing the element and the godshape together.  For example, if you WEAVE VIGOR DRAGON you will have created an amber dragon that when invoked upon an individual will restore their vigor (also known as strength).  Many times, you will hear people cry out for vigor.  The Comfort rune will provide a combination of healing and vigor; the Heal rune will restore hit points, and the Strength rune also provides vigor.   As you weave spells, you will notice that they are stored in your mind as corridors.  Corridors are numbered in the order that they were created in your mind.

Once corridors are created, I suggest that you memorize a spell to make it easier to use.  Memorizing allows you to name a corridor; for instance, let's stay the first spell you memorized was a vigor spell; you may wish to MEMorize Vig 1.  The spell contained in your first corridor is now named Vig.  The process of memorizing spells is not necessary to invoke them.

Casting spells, or invoking them, is very simple.  Simply, INVOKE the spell at the target.  Each spell you wish to invoke is addressed by its corridor number or name. Here comes Yornok again, beat up as usual.  This time you want to help him with rune magick, so simply INVOKE Vig at Yornok.  You will notice, and so will everyone else, that runes coalesce and whirl about your head.  After a delay, the runes will fly toward their target, and Yornok will receive vigor.  Any spell is invoked in the same manner; when you first invoke a spell you will immediately tire from the fatigue cost of casting the magick.  Then, you fall into a semi-trance state (just like laying of hands, you will be unable to perform complex actions) for the time required to fashion the spell.  After casting you will pay a small fatigue cost to maintain the spell on the individual until the spell dissipates or is dispelled.  Dispelling a spell takes time, and if it fails can backlash, draining you of strength.  You can dispel someone else's spell as well as your own, but you can only dispel spells that you know.  For instance, you notice that Yornok is fully recovered and you no longer wish to maintain your vigor  spell on him.  Simply, DISPEL Vig Yornok.  You will again fall into a semi-trance state, usually ten seconds, and the spell will be gone.  

Most godshape healing spells take 20 seconds to cast.  Now, this is where the Small rune comes into play.  There may come times when 20 seconds is simply too long.  You may invoke your spell with the Small rune modifier to cut down on the time delay.  Yornok is near death, and every second is critical; so you INVOKE SMALL VIG at Yornok.  A healing spell, invoked with Small, will shave 5 seconds off the casting time.  It also cuts down the effectiveness by approximately 3/4.  But, if hunting with someone, that 5 seconds can mean the difference between life and death.  You should simply ignore the Average rune; as all spells are, be default, considered to be of average size unless you modify it with the Small rune.

You may have noticed that one rune hasn't been discussed yet, that being Fire.  Fire, as you may have guessed, is not woven as a healing spell.  It is, as a heart cleric, the only offensive spell you are given.  Once woven with your godshape, it will be an effective means of both hunting, and offense if necessary.  It is woven and invoked exactly like the healing spells described above.

Now, you know how to create and invoke your rune magick.  You have runes being used and corridors being filled.  How do you check these?  Quite easily, for more information on your runes and magick you need only ask for INFO RUNE, or INFO MAGICK.  These will allow you to mentally inventory your spells and the charges remaining in your elemental runes.  Each time you weave a spell or invoke it, you use 1 charge.  Another thing you should notice, when you inventory your spells, is the spell's alignment.  Most spells will be Neutral; however, some spells that you may acquire later in life could be Chaotic.  Any cleric who is Entropic or Orderly should avoid the use of chaotic spells.  The invocation of these spells will slowly shift your alignment towards Chaos.  This can have disastrous results ranging from being cast out of your temple to death.

We've discussed how to create, invoke, dispel, and inventory rune magick.  Next, I'd like to offer some advice on when to use these spells.  If you are in the Training Ground, use your spells sparingly.  There is no way to recharge your runes there; they can only be recharged at the Mage's Guild in Spur.  Once you come to Spur, use them whenever you feel like it; as it only costs 100 silver for a heart cleric to recharge an individual rune.  However, while in the TG, I recommend only using runes for healing if you are hunting and can not have someone lay down or they can not afford to be put into the semi-trance from the laying of hands.  If someone has managed to make it to a peace bonded area there is usually no compelling reason to cast a vigor spell on them when they can simply sleep.


Divine Intervention

The gods expect the love and devotion of their followers; in return,  any follower, not just clerics, can, in times of need, call upon his god and ask for their divine aid.  This is done through the use of prayers.   However, in order for prayers to be answered, you must have shown your devotion to your deity by donating portions of your wealth to them.  In return, you receive favors.  These favors can then be used to ask for your god's aid.  To donate to your god, you must worship at the altar of your god.  When you KNEEL before the altar, an acolyte will approach you and ask whether you wish to donate, or pray to your god.  If you choose to DONATE, the acolyte will ask you the amount and take the donation from you.  For these donations, you will receive favors; the more generous your are, the more favors your god will bestow upon you.  These favors can later be exchanged for your god's aid at some opportune time.  You can inquire into the amount of favors you have been granted, at any time, by requesting INFO RELigion.  You will then know the exact amount of favors you have, and your current religious ranking among the temple's followers.  As a side note, your temple rank is in no way related to, or affected by, your guild rank.

To receive a boon (the granting of a special favor) from your god, you must kneel at their alter.  As before, an acolyte will approach you and ask what you desire.  If you tell him PRAY, then you will be given a list of benefits your god will be willing to grant to you.  Each benefit has the amount of favors you will need to exchange for the benefit.  As you acquire more favors, your god will be willing to grant more benefits to you.  An example of some of the boons granted by your god are: Healing, Cure Poison, Bless Weapon, Bless Armor.  

Favors may also be used to request divine intervention through the use of prayers.  There are times, when you may be in such a predicament, that only through the intervention of your god will you be able to survive.  Perhaps, you are hunting and suddenly walk into a large band of rogues.  Within seconds you have received so many wounds that you may die, and you don't have the time to either lay hands or cast a spell.  So, you PRAY SA HEAL ME.  Your god will then heal you, if he or she wishes.  Be warned, the gods do not always answer your prayers, and some gods are more fickle than others.  You may also pray for intervention for someone other than yourself.  An example of some of the more common prayers are: Heal, Strengthen (provides vigor), Hide, Sanctuary (will translocate you back to their temple), and Resurrect.  Each time you god grants your prayer, you lose the number of favors corresponding to its cost.  If you do not have enough favors for the prayer, your god will not answer your call.


Combat Skills

As Heart Clerics, we are dedicated to the healing and avoidance of harming of sentient life.  However, that does not mean you should ignore your combat abilities.  We  are naturally skilled in the use of blunt weapons, and by increasing our proficiency in these weapons we receive two important benefits.  First, as we become better with blunt weapons we become harder to attack.  You will be able to negate some conflicts simply because you are able to avoid ever being hit.  This will also provide you with an advantage of being more able to reach those in need, if you yourself can pass through areas unscathed.  A cleric dying on the way to heal, or resurrect someone, is of no use to anyone.  Second, as with any form of physical training you improve the shape you are in.  By training in the weapons skills you are able increase your health and your strength.  This can go a long ways to increasing the number of successive spells you can invoke and maintain, and the amount of health you can restore to individuals before you are exhausted.  Also, with our great proficiency in Channeling due to our healing ability, we are second only to RuneMages in the use of Magick.  While our rune selection is limited, our offensive capability with those runes is vast.


The Road to Resurrection

So, you are a healer; but, not matter how hard you work, you won't be able to save everyone.  People are going to die.  So you want to bring the dead back to life, you say?  How do you do it, you say?  Well, the process is simple.  Being able to use it is a little harder.  To bring someone back from the dead, you need to use the Resurrection prayer.  This prayer, however, is only available to clerics of Devoted rank.  So, let's start by discussing temple ranks.

If you're not sure where you rank in the temple hierarchy, then most likely you are a Novitiate.  To check, simply request INFO RELigion, just like you do when you are checking the number of favors you have.  There are five temple ranks,  and each successive rank is acquired through the accumulation of prayers.  Once enough prayers have been accumulated, your god will speak to you, praise your devotion, and ask if you wish to be raised to the next level.  If you accept this offer, you exchange the required number of favors for the rise in rank.  Any favors above this number will still be available to you.  The ranks, and their favor requirements are:

				Novitiate	0
	Novitiate to 	Charitable	5,000
	Charitable to	Loyal		10,000
	Loyal to 		Loving	20,000
	Loving to 		Devoted	30,000

You can, at any one time, have no more than 30,000 favors.  Hence, when you accept the rank of Devoted, you will have no favors left.  The cost of favors increase with each level - at Novitiate each favor will cost 5 silver coins, and by the time you reach Devoted, favors will cost 15 silver coins.  Becoming a devoted cleric, of any god, is not an easy task, and will, on average, require the donation of more than 750,000 pieces of silver.

Once you reach devoted rank, you may then ask your god to intervene and raise someone from the dead.  Let's say that this time Yornok didn't make it.  A friend of his has asked you to resurrect the poor Thugian.  Once you reach his body, you can then PRAY SA RESurrect Yornok.  Your god will step in bring Yornok back to life.  Like any other prayer, you must be able to pay the cost in favors at the time.  To resurrect someone of the same religion as you will cost 500 favors; to resurrect someone from a different religion costs 1000 favors.  Most clerics who resurrect someone will require a payment, to recoup their costs, for performing this service.  The advantage of resurrection, as opposed to departing, is that when you depart you run the risk of losing some ability in one or more skills.  Resurrection, on the other hand, does not carry this risk.


The Ethics of Healing

I end this document with a discussion on the Ethics of Healing.  Now, let me first state that there is no right or wrong opinion in this issue.  This topic has been, and will always be, discussed (sometimes heatedly) at great lengths by clerics throughout the land.  I was tempted not to include it here, but I feel that since it such an important topic that it should be addressed.  The main thing to remember is that you, and only you, should decide when and who you heal.  Do what you feel is right regarding this matter.  I will try to express my viewpoint as succinctly as possible.

First, as heart clerics we vow to seek those in need and aid them...  However, this does not, in my opinion, mean that we must heal anyone who asks for aid.  If someone who you personally know to be infamous for bringing harm to others asks for your aid; you are within your rights to withhold aid from that person.  For, if you heal them, do you not simply enable them to go forth and bring more harm to others.  Isn't that a more grievous violation of our oath to aid an individual who will harm many, then to withhold healing from that one?  However, I encourage you to only withhold aid from those whom you personally know to be harming people, or in rare cases, if people, whom you trust greatly, inform you of their misdeeds.  You will hear of many disputes, and you should be careful of whose tale you accept before you hear the other side of the story.

The other part of our vow is to avoid the harming of sentient life.  That does not mean you should not defend yourself if you are attacked.  I urge you to use as many non-lethal methods as are available to you.  Avoid conflict as much as you can by leaving the area, if possible.  Flying will often take you out of many dangers.  If you can not leave the area, since you may need to heal, or even defend, someone else; then try to use attacks such as webs or sleep darts.  Many attackers will be discouraged if they find you can nullify their attacks (by flying), or render them helpless (sleep darts and webs).  If these means are not effective then you may be forced to use more martial means against them.  Again, I would give them every opportunity to break off and leave, but if you are backed into the proverbial corner, then you may be forced to decide between dying yourself or using a lethal attack.  That is a choice only you can make.  I, however, see no shame in the taking of life in defense of yourself, or others; especially, if you have given the attacker every opportunity to withdraw.

May your god always be with you.

                       So, you want to be a Thief?

The Skills of a Thief

     There's been much dispute on what skills a Thief should have, so I've decided to enlighten some of you lost Thieves out there on what skills could bring a boost to your career. First I will list the skills that count towards your Guild Ranking, and then I will list off a few spells that don't count, but will help your survival in the Spur.

-Fearagoh Stalberdin

Guild Skills:

Sharp Weapons, Blunt Weapons, Pole Weapons, Throw Weapons, Missle Weapons
 - All Thieves start with the Sharp Weapons skill, and if you're going to pickpocket anyone, you're going to need to defend yourself. All theses skills are good for hunting if you work them up to a suitable level. Throwing weapons are ideal for Thieves, and throwing daggers are common amongst many in Thievedome.

Quickdraw - Just in case you get in a tight squeeze, unarmed. If you have this skill, WORK ON IT, you will most likely  fumble a lot the first few levels. So remember, level 0 Quickdraw is better then level 1. ;)

Dodging- This skill is not yet implemented, but when it is..it will obviously be useful to any Thief.

Bargaining- What Thief can live their life without a good scam....err..."deal" once in a while? Though this skill is also not yet implemented, I'm sure it will be of good use when it is.

Identify gems/minerals- Another one of the famous ID skills that is not of much help except to raise your Guild Rankings. Unless you really want to know the price of a gem.

Detect traps- Handy skill, except....well, until the traps on chests work it isn't good for much except to raise your Guild Rankings, if that's what you're shooting for. But when traps are here, it will definately help.

Remove traps- Who wants to get a Sphere of Fire in their face when they open a chest? No one..I hope, and as soon as this skill is implemented...and traps are activated....it will be very valuable to any Thief in their right mind. :)

Hiding- This is one of a Thieves most valuable and primary skills. All of us have been in a situation where you need to hide from someone, or spy in on a conversation. Also handy if you get caught picking ;)

Pick pockets- This is the Thieves most basic and primary skill, Pickpockets. I would advise ALL Thieves not to attempt actually going out and picking people until they're level 5-10, so you have less chance of getting caught and ending up dead. Picking can be profitable, and sometimes not. Most people are aware that there are so many of us out there, and thus tend to keep their pockets empty. :(

Stealth- Very, very handy. Work up your hiding a bit, then work Stealth up to about level 5. Then, you can have a very easy time eavesdropping on meetings or just sneaking around town.

Identify weapon quality- This can be handy at times, for finding out the price and other details of a stolen weapon or rare weapon of some sort, but is hard to advance in.

Other unimplemented skills soon to come:

Climbing
Disguise
Pick locks
Shoplifting
Locate hidden doors
Identify armor quality

Non-Guild Skills: 

First Aid- Yes, this skill was majorly tweaked, but I believe it is for the best. Anyhow, this skill may save you life, and if you work on it enough it can be a very nice skill to have. It will stop the bleeding from wounds you have taken, as well as restore some of the hit points you may have lost.

Channeling- This can be of some use to any Thief, but the weavable runes available for us are slim. Here are the spells for the Thief Class:

Blending Aura
Sleep Dart ***
Palsy Dart (Doesn't work yet)
Poison Dart (Doesn't work)
Water Wall (Doesn't work)

Ok, so we aren't Runemages, but sleep dart helps a bunch. If you're facing a flying foe, drop them to the ground and hit them. I discourage the use of this spell by new Thieves to sleep search, as it will instantly vault you to the top of many peoples must kill list.

Disarming- Disarm can be very helpful if you work your primary sharp skill up high, and can easily disable your opponent and win you a battle. I advise you to train in this skill.

Shield Parry- This is somewhat of a help for Fighting-Thiefs. Very hard to advance in, but can be parry blows easier at a higher rank.

Here's a list of the skills you are born with when you first arrive in the Spur:

Hiding, Sharp Weapons, Pick Locks, Pick Pockets, Identify Gems.

I hope this helps any Thieves out there that may be lost in their skills or the use of them. Thanks for reading, and watch your pockets!

Prepared Entries, First Place Bardic Championship Winner:  Acinonyxx Aquilar

'Fly Your Dream'

Yesterday I stood
Alone upon a hill,
And my life
Was just an empty thing.
But you joined me
Of your own free will,
And I knew
I'd never learned to dream.

I had lost my way
As young Dragons sometimes do
As the stormclouds gathered overhead.
But then you said some
Words that rang so true,
And I knew,
I'd found my way instead.

You told me about
A dream you often had
Of the day
When you would get your wings.
You would soar up high
And with your nose, touch the clouds.
For our Kin,
You vowed to do great things.

In a day it came
When it was your time to change,
And your dream
Was about to come true.
You furled your wings
And with a stroke, set your range.
And the skies
Turned from grey to blue.

With grace you flew
And soared above the trees.
For a moment
You held all your dreams;
But the Bane of Dragons,
From a bow they came in threes,
And your dream
Turned from joy to screams.

From the sky you fell
To the plains below where you flew.
And while there stunned
I could only ask why...
You were never found,
But where you touched, a flower grew.
When I saw it
Is when I learned to cry.

Today it came
For my turn to fly,
And for a moment
I felt lonely and apart.
But as I flew
Across the cloudless sky,
I felt your dream
Beat within my heart.

Yesterday I stood
Alone upon a hill.
I'd felt my life
Had never meant to be.
But when you fell
And your life eternally still,
In the twilight I saw
What you helped me see.

As I flew
Across the cloudless sky
I instilled in my heart
That your dream shall never die.


Ah, well, that brought a tear to my eye.  :::::::Allandra quickly brushes a wistful tear aside, and prepares the next composition ::::::


Spur-of-the-Moment, First Bardic Championship Winner:  Ragarn Lazlo

[Columnist's Comment:   Ragarn pointed out that this composition was part of a larger play, depicting a scene during which a Frontacian Nobleman speaks to the  Emperor and his Council about attacking the psycians]

'...On Psycians'

All around the Empire, as you walk through the streets,
There are many beings you shall happen to meet.
Some are good, gentle and noble souls,
Who will offer you their shelter, money or clothes.
Others whom you meet, though, may not be so sweet,
These demons in disguise who walk upon two feet.
They have insidious powers to warp your mind,
Making you look past their deeds so that they seem kind.

Beware, though, these Mind-Benders, for their power is great,
And in their heart there resides a great hate.
Psycians, psycians.....they seek to conquer our land.
We must strike first, draw a line in the sand.
The total obliteration of their entire race, 
GENOCIDE, I say, we must commence with all haste.
So, put down those feelings of remorse, and pity,
Strike now to destroy and turn to ashes, their city..... 

[Columnist's Comment:   Yes, being psycian, I shuddered too, when I first heard it,  but one must accept its merit within the spirit of poetic artistry and license.]

On a Lighter Note

Following my expose' on the two Oog-ra romantics roaming Spur, it seems they've gone into hiding.   All my sources on the matter have suddenly dried up.   Hmmm......wonder if they're wandering the underground lake area, away from the bright lights and big city.   Drop me a line if you spy any kissing going on down there, will ya?


The Party

If you missed Dragohe's party last week at the Lion, here's the inside scoop.   Yours Truly ushered in the affair with a little poem,  vainly fighting for the spotlight with the sudden arrival of long-awaited Hithual ale.   Potent, top-of-the-line, the best,  I might add.   It seems the brew was temporarily hijacked enroute, and did THAT cause quite a stir when the word spread.   We nearly had a melee.   But all's well that ends well.   With the guests fed and well-lubricated,  a band strode in to strike up the dancing.   I must admit, my tender feet hurt after a few of those vigorous spinning waltzes.   But was it fun!  Anyway, a highlight of the evening was the unexpected arrival of Rehas,  and to our amazement,  even the Govern'r dropped in for a short surprise visit.   You should've been there.   (Not to mention the rumors I heard of kissing going on in various and sundry alcoves of this fine establishment. )  

 I also heard talk of a proposed bachelor/bachelorette raffle,  but unfortunately missed that number,  having of course sudden pressing matters that compelled me to high-tail it out of there at that point.  :::::chuckles:::::

Our thanks to Dragohe the drag-al for hosting this first Spurian bash.   

Rumors

I've heard accounts of roving ships plundering temples up and down the coast, probably headed our way in the near future.   Might have something to do with the mysterious sword hidden in Town Square.  Time will tell.   I fear we're in for one nasty fight, so sharpen those swords and keep your eyes and ears open. 

Well, I've taken enough of your valuable time.  Thanks for listening, and I hope to see you all at the next Spurian Bardic Championships on March 5.  

P.S.   I'm not at all averse to collecting any juicy gossip you might come across on your travels.   So if you see me around Spur, feel free to pass it on.

============================================================================


Rise of the Classes

So far in the Rise of the Classes, we've look into the Hand Clerics, Heart Clerics, Barbarians, and Thieves Guilds.  Once again, we are going to take a look at two classes completely opposite of one another--the magick slinging runemages and the weapon swinging fighters.


The Runemage Guild

  Like the other guilds we've reviewed, the Runemage Guild has undergone some shifting.  Now heading the runemages is one of two females in the Top Ten, Tisha LuckyStarre.  Close behind her is the newly elected Khatyr, Skratchnar Mistoffeles.  The next four in the Top Ten are constants in the guild and are constantly switching their ranked orders amongst each other.  They are Ragarn, Jari, Gristle, and Jale.  Gristle and Ragarn both mentioned a truce between them regarding their head-to-head advancement.  Rounding off the top ten are Guaire, Ariadhne, Symbus, and they glowing runemage Marakos stealing the number ten spot.  Marakos has two sides to his coin showing as his advesaries try to decide which is worse... the mighty firesphere or the head wracking psi bolt.

A few words were chosen to be shared by the Guild Leader, Tisha LuckyStarre:

"Because the guild say I number one don't make me da master.   I love my magicks so I practice and practice really hard.  And I practice wrapping bandages lots, too, so I can helps keep peoples healthy.  The real masters I recognize are Ragarn, Gristle, and Jale...who teached me lots 'bout magicks and have been kind enough to share wif me their great wisdom and experience."

                 RUNEMAGES

1: Tisha LuckyStarre the Secian Rank 
2: Skratchnar Mistoffeles the Leuian Rank 
3: Ragarn Lazlo the Frontacian Rank 
4: Jari Coppers the Drag-al Rank 
5: Gristle Bonebreaker the Thugian Rank 
6: Jale Vycor the Anthian Rank 
7: Guaire Amalasan the Frontacian Rank 
8: Ariadhne Amalasan the Frontacian Rank
9: Symbus Khatmaar the Leuian Rank 
10: Marakos Nunsiska the Psycian Rank 
11: Crunch Bonebreaker the Thugian Rank 
12: Starman Comet the Frontacian Rank 
13: Trelantris BaleFire the Secian Rank 
14: Miricas Ortrell the Psycian Rank 
15: Balinor Buckhanna the Thugian Rank 
16: Coeur Soie the Leuian Rank

28: DyreI Vaxalavaleyar the San Elf Rank 
29: Fallin Invoker the Anthian Rank 
30: Taios Sembhi the Frontacian Rank 


The Fighters Guild

  The fighters have also gone over some slight alterations.  Due to the poor sighted Guild Inspector, Ekrin Bulfol, Dragons had accidentally been placed within the ranks of fighters.  How one could confuse a Dragon in that way, I couldn't say.  Because of this large error...the Guild Inspector was demoted to kennel cleaner and was replaced by Szhrak Glindez, a very hard taskmaster.  In Szhrak's latest update, we have only those who have been to their weaponsmaster since the relatively short time in which he has been in his new position.  Those within Ekrin's records have been cleared out and will not be allowed back into the guild rankings until they are approved by Szhrak.  In short...we have a whole new order of rankings compared to the last time we saw this class.  I welcome everyone in the Fighters Guild to the Rise of the Classes, and recognize TigerClaw Pridebound as the new Guildmaster.

  			     Genuine Steel
                    by Dartanyan Radagast

	The sound of a dozen conversations mixing all at once permeated the
air of the Inn of Lost Hopes.  The scent of pungent ale and hot food mixed 
together in a tantalizing smell that made Dragohe's mouth water and stomach
growl. He glanced around annoyed, and, raising his snout up into the air, 
let forth a loud bellow.  
	"Where's mah food, wench?"  
	The waitress, carrying four pitchers of ale and barely balancing a 
tray of food, scowled in his direction and let out a piercing, 
	"Keep it down buster, we're busy!" 
Dragohe, subdued for the moment, sank back into his chair and mumbled 
something that sounded like, 
	"Ahm only hungry. Must be that time of the month er somethin."
	He began to drum a funky beat on the table that eventually escalated
into a full production of tail-swinging, head swaying, and feet stomping.
Ratta-tat SLAM! BAM! Ratta-ratta BaM ba baMM! All conversation inside the inn stopped, and everyone began staring and peering around each other to get a better look at what all the commotion was about. Dragohe, at the height of his performance, gave the table a mighty KA-BAM!, threw his arms out, and cheered loudly. 
	"Thankya, tankya! Have a nice night, folks!"
  He flumped into his chair, and conversation slowly began to resume. 
Dragohe thought he heard a "what the hell was that?" and probably a "don't
worry, its just a Drag-al," but he was too concerned with the approaching
plate of steaming food, carried tantalizingly high above the head of a 
buxom waitress. She plunked down his heaping plate of steak, piled high with
grilled onions and mushrooms heavily seasoned with garlic, of course, mashed
potatoes and peas. A cool, frothy glass of cold ale was slammed down 
immediately after, and the waitress sauntered off, preparing to deliver 
another order. The Drag-al was so enraptured by the sight of the food that
he paid no heed to the waitress' swaying hips, something he rarely avoidied
missing. Dragohe dug into the steak, making appreciative smacking noises 
with every bite. Halfway through his quickly disapearing meal a silent 
figure slipped into the chair adjacant his. Dragohe, paying no heed, started
in on the potatoes, which protested with a grainy smussSH as he squeezed 
them between his teeth and down his throat. The stranger, rather disgusted, 
looked around furtively. The Drag-al was a spectacle all seemed to ignore, 
they choosing to focus on their meals rather than his. The stranger sighed,
then knocked with two knuckles on Dragohe's skull.
	"Hey. Anything in there?"
	"Yehp," Dragoe replied, sending a few particles of mushroom across 
the table. The stranger pulled back her hood, revealing beautiful, deep 
auburn eyes, shiney black hair, and the features of a beautiful Leuian.
	"You eat like a Thugian," she remarked, narrowing her cat-like 
eyes and watching gravy dribble down his chin.
	"Show?" Dragohe queried, this time sending a small lump of potato 
towards, then ricocheting off of, her cloak. She started to growl, and 
the fur on her hackles began to raise in annoyance.
	"We have to leave, now."
	Dragohe, preoccupied with the peas scrambling away from his fork,
looked up.
	"Why? Look Cynth, I'm a hungry guy! Gots to have my eats."
	She raised an eyebrow at him, then stuck out a cute, yet feline 
pink tongue at the small balls of green vegetable on his plate that were 
happily evading his erratically stabbing fork.
	"How can you eat those? Besides, I thought you disliked 
vegetables. I believe you remarked, 'veggies shmeggies'."
	Dragohe shrugged. "Hey, I like the name. Besides, this place gots
shum good greens."
	Cynthia rolled her eyes and tried a different approach, purring 
quietly and softly running her extended claws up and down his arm. 
He jerked away violently, sending a shower of peas cascading towards the 
floor.
	"Cynthia, don't DO that!" he shivered. "Now lookit, my pees er all
on the floor."
	He glowered at her, then grinned sheepishly as her feline eyes
narrowed into small angry slits. She stood up slowly, replaced the hood to
her head and began to stalk away angrily, yet with beautiful catlike grace,
Dragohe noticed, appraising with satisfaction her well-rounded posterior.
He tipped the plate up to his lips, and, with a resounding 'ahhh'
dumped the rest of the peas into his mouth. Chewing away, he downed the
green paste with a final draught of ale. Standing up hastily he left the 
waitress the meal price and a generous tip in silvers. Picking up his steel
helm and armor from underneath the table, he tried to strap them both on
quickly as he scampered after Cynthia's retreating form.
	"Waitup!" he called, sidestepping to avoid a waitress and bumping
into someones table. Oblivious to the spilled ale and the chaos he was 
creating in his wake, he pursued her, weaving across the busy inn
and fiddling with the leather strap on his helm. He burst out of the inn and
into the quiet twilight, illuminated faintly by the windows of the
inn. He struggled into his armor and waddled towards the long shadows 
framing windows of the inn.
	"Okay Cynth, whazup?" he called, banging his right arm loudly
against the side of his body in an attempt to get it through the tight
opening in the armor. With each violent whack, the armor resounded with
a piercing clang, Clang, CLANG! He heard a hissing from the shadows, and
Cynthia's angry hushed tone.
	"Would you please kindly shut-up, you walking tin-can!"
	Dragohe, his arm finally through and the armor adjusted properly,
waddled over towards the hiss.
	"Hey, you didn't have to go and insult my armer, ya know. One-of-a
kind genuine steel, worn by mah Great Grandpappy Joe DeDragalh!"
	Cynthia looked at him.
	"Well, actually, I just bought it from Ferran Fireseeker, but same
difference, right?"
	Cynthia just shook her head and looked at the ground.
	"Listen Dragohe, this is really important, okay? A friend of mine,
Tygris, got trapped by a couple of wights in the graveyard. They locked
him in a tomb, and he can't get out! I tried to fight the wights myself,
but..." she sighed.  
	"Your sword would be appreciated, okay?"
	Dragohe grinned and pulled his steel saber out of his sheath. He
waved it around for a moment, appreciating the gleam from the inn's light
on its polished surface, then turned it around, hilt first towards her.
	"Okay. Here."
	She smiled, nodded at him.
	"Thank-you. Honestly, this means a lot to me."
	Dragohe shrugged, then smiled.
	"Hey, I wouldn't expect you to do any less for me right?"
	He grinned, flipped the sword back to himself, and returned it to
his sheath. Cynthia looked at him again, his rather short yet muscular
lizard-like appearance. He always had that big, sloppy grin on his face,
and for some bizarre reason, she found it almost charming. His silvery
eyes were amazing, and she couldn't help looking into them. His muscular
arms tightened as he folded them across his chest, and his head turned
slightly to the right as if listening to something.
	"Didja hear that?"
	"Hm?" she said, snapping out of her daze. She admonished herself
for losing focus, and glanced around, listening intently with her 
sharp ears. If he had heard it, and he had some of the worst perception on
the planet, then she should probably pick it up. This time she heard it,
a quiet shuffling sound in the shadows to the north. 
	"Wow," she whispered. "That was pretty soft, I'm surprised you 
picked that up."
	Dragohe shrugged silently, and she wondered how he accomplished
this feat, laden as he was in his heavy steel armor. She shook her head, reminding herself to lecture him on the merits of leather mail later.
	"Let's just keep going, pretend you didn't hear anything."
	He nodded and began to walk surprisingly quietly, his armor
protesting with only a quiet clanking sound. They continued north, past
where the sound was lurking, up through the temple district. Eventually
they reached the black obsidian gate leading into the graveyard, standing
ominously open. A cold wind began to stir up here, and a winding path 
surrounded by tipped and crumbling gravestones decorated the view through
the gate. She took her place in front, leading the way through the gate
and into the graveyard. Dragohe drew his saber with a faint shink and
began to cautiously peer around. She knew that, when it came to battle,
Dragohe took it very seriously.  They continued north along the path,
the steps they had heard before forgotten with the mystery and fear of
the graveyard. A few graves to the right side were clawed up, as if their
occupants had grown tired of sleeping beneath the ground and had decided
to rejoin the living of the world.  That same shuffling sound
reached her ears again and she stopped, hunching over instinctively into
a battle stance. Her claws flashed out of her hands reflexively, and she
sniffed the air faintly for any sort of odor from her attacker. Dragohe
saw her crouch; then a shadowy form leaped out from the shadows.
	"Cynth!" he yelled, charging forward to push her out of the way.
Too late, the rogue who had been stalking them ever since the inn brought
his battle-axe down towards Cynthia's head with crushing force. She lept
gracefully away, but was caught on the side and sent to the ground,
clutching a rib. The rogue smiled nastilly and raised the axe over
his head to finish the job when his arm was cut nearly in two by a well-
delivered saber strike from Dragohe. He was knocked back, but quickly
recovered and focused his attention on the Drag-al, who was already 
swinging a second time, a backhand strike that narrowly missed the rogue's
head. Leaping under the saber and crouching directly in front of Dragohe,
the dirty thief swung a strong blow at his torso with the axe. Clang! The
blow was deflected off Dragohes armor, and the Drag-al decided that a stream
of flame would be the best response. Opening his mouth wide and his lips 
curling back automatically, a jet of hot fire spewed from his mouth with a
snarl and a woosh. Eyes widening in surprise, the rogue tried in vain to 
leap out of the way of the searing lance of fire, but was engulfed in flame
and quickly killed by a few strong strikes from the Drag-als singing sword.
Dragohe leered over his prey and then remembered Cynthia, looking over in 
her direction. She was smiling at him, but sitting up and clutching her 
side, no indication of the sharp pain she must be feeling showing on her 
delicate features. Hurriedly he walked over and carefully lifted up her 
tunic to examine the blow. She did not so much as wince, much to his 
surprise, as he began to tenderly probe the wound. Carefully he took a few 
strips of cloth and ointment from his first aid materials, hidden in a 
pack somewhere beneath his armor, and began to bind the wound, stopping it 
from bleeding and hopefully keeping the thankfully cracked, not broken, 
rib from chafing or moving. It was strange, having him this close, she 
mused. She couldn't remember him being so near before. She smiled at him,
breathed carefully in his musky, spicy odor, and the sharp mediciny smell of
the cool ointment he applied to her wound. He looked into her deep amber 
eyes and she looked back into his silvery ones, she noting the tender 
concern there and he seeing, for the first time, a somewhat soft, vulnerable
side to her. He smiled and helped her to her feet, then searched the remains
of the rogue, finding a pouch with twenty silver. He offered her half, but 
she shook her head. Not only had he killed it, but had tended her wounds as
well. It was not her money to spend. He shrugged and pocketed the money as 
well as the battle-axe.
	"Are you okay? D'you think we should find a healer or something?"
	She shook her head no. "I'm fine, don't worry."
	Dragohe grinned. "The last time you said that, you passed out in
the middle of a hunt!"
	She smiled but ignored his comment and continued along the path, he
hurrying to catch up with her quickly vanishing form.
	The eerie path continued, past old weathered headstones and shadowy
black oaks, whose branches sometimes loomed over the path like skeletal
fingers. The night turned slowly from velvet to pitch, and Dragohe pulled
a cedar torch out of his pack and lit it. The torch emitted a red circle of
light that only faintly illuminated the immediate area. The shadows 
surrounding the path were deep and wavery, and Dragohe swore more than once
that he saw some one or thing moving in the distance, following them. Time
passed slowly and Cynthia did not say anything at all, and Dragohe chose not
to say much either, deciding instead to concentrate on the divets in the 
path. Soon enough the tomb was in sight, a tiny stone building that was 
sealed shut with a large, heavy looking stone slab. The path branched off to
the east and west, but Cynthia continued walking straight towards the cold
building. The torch began to illuminate a tall forboding shape that loomed
directly in front of the stone slab covering the squat buildings entrance.
Who or what the figure was was not discernable from this distance, but it
seemed to radiate a bitterly cold aura of fear. As they got closer Dragohe
began to see what it was, a figure clad in a dirty, tattered cloak that
hung down to its feet and stirred faintly in the piercing wind that wafted
through the surrounding area. A black hood hid its face, and its hands were
lost somewhere in the shadows of its voluminous cloak. Cynthia stopped
suddenly and began to sniff the air and glance about while Dragohe, 
oblivious to her caution, kept walking, drawn by curiosity toward the 
figure. As he stepped closer towards the cloaked person, its head began to 
rise slowly.  Seemingly paralyzed with fear but merely waiting for the 
person to speak, Dragohe stopped and pasted a friendly grin on his face. 
Then it lept, the hood falling aside revealing a white bleached grinning
skull that still had clumps and strands of tattered flesh attached to
its gleaming surface, its sharp bony fingers extended and curled, 
raking violently at his chest. It cut through his armor as if it were 
butter, leaving five deep, bleeding gashes in the center of his torso. 
Dragohe stumbled back and the wight brought its hand back to slash again 
when Cynthia pounced, a spitting furious ball of angry fur, slashing wildly
with her claws. Her blows fell but did not do much damage as the substance
shrouded by the wights' cloak was not entirely solid. She was successful in
driving the wight back, which gave Dragohe a chance to recover. He lept 
forward and feinted a jab, then spun the sword up into the air in a half
circle around and down that connected with the wight's head, finishing the
swing with a strong thrust to the torso. The blows were strong and had
enough force behind them to drive the wight to the ground. Snarling at the
wight, he prepared to swing again when he was struck soundly on the head
from behind. Another wight had slipped out of the shadows and brought both
fists down on top of Dragohe's skull, his helm saving him from being 
knocked out. He reversed his grip on the sword and stabbed behind him, the
body of the wight running up to the hilt. In one smooth motion, Dragohe
turned and tried to pull the sword out of the wights' body when the wight,
with amazing strength, clutched the blade of the saber and wouldn't let go.
Dragohe tugged in vain, then drew his short iron dirk out of a smaller
concealed sheath at his side and began hacking at the wights' hands in an
attempt to force it to release the sword. He finally swung at its head, three strong blows that killed the creature. Releasing his grip on the
sword before the wight did, Dragohe whirled and threw his dirk. The wight
behind him, in mid-leap, faltered and crashed to the ground, the knife
embedded in its forehead. Dragohe pulled his sword out of the wight, then
was sent sprawling as a strong blow was dealt to his right side. Two more
wights were circling Dragohe, and he looked over at Cynthia for help, only
to see that she had her own attacker to deal with. The wights circling him
lept in tandem, grinning obscenely at him with their rotting skull faces.
Dragohe dodged one but was struck by the other, his helmet causing the 
strike to glance off his head but still scrape the side of his face. Dragohe
swung at the wight and missed, the second one tearing off a chunk of flesh
from his arm with a brutal swipe. Snarling in pain, he opened his mouth and
spewed forth a bolt of fire. The wight was engulfed momentarily, but the
fire quickly began to fade unnaturally away. Adrenaline began to wear off
and exhaustion set in as the wights continued their relentless attack. 
Slowly circling him again, they waited for him to make a move, so that they
could counter-attack while he was off guard. Dragohe reached slowly, 
imperceptably, into his med kit and took out a small bronze snippet. As the
wights began to leap at him, he inserted the herb into his mouth and under
his tongue, barely stepping out of the way of their flailing limbs and 
hands. His armor reduced the damage from another strike, then the juice from
the herb began to seep through his body. The wounds decorating the Drag-als'
hide began to tingle and sting fiercely, only to be replaced slowly by a heady, rushing cold feeling as the bleeding slowed and the cells composing his leathery hide joined quickly and began to knit back together. This tired him even further, and he was barely able to swing his saber effectively. When a stray blow from the steel blade connected, there wasn't much force behind it as his fatigued muscles protested violently against the vigorous activity. Just when it appeared that he had finally incapacitated one of the wights, it reached out with both hands as it fell, seemingly slain, and gouged two enormous chunks of flesh out of his right leg. A howl of pain erupted from Dragohe, and he swung furiously at the wight. The sword connected with the wights' skull and splintered, breaking in two and sending fragments of metal in every direction. Dragohe gazed at the broken sword, literally and  figuratively stunned. Then something slammed hard into him from behind and he was sent sprawling, falling on his face as the wight on his back raked wildly into and through his armor, shredding his flesh. Lances and criss-crosses of pain erupted throughout his back, and his last view before he lost consciousness was the ground rushing forward and back as his face was repeatedly slammed into it.
	Pain screamed through every fiber of his body. Each individual cell
and nerve ending protested with a razor sharp jab of white hot pain. 
Simultaneously Dragohe's eyes and mouth opened, preparing to scream in utter
agony as his essence began to flee his body. Then, instantaneously the pain
was gone, and his eyes focused and senses returned. Kneeling above him and 
with her hands placed softly on his bare chest was Cynthia. A faint white 
aura surrounded her body, and her eyes were closed, lips moving faintly, as
if speaking to someone. A feeling of great warmpth and peace flowed from
her body into his, and he closed his eyes again and relaxed. A few moments
later he opened his eyes again and was greeted, not by Cynthia's smiling
face, but by a large clump of green something-or-others that flew wildly
back and forth in front of his snout.
	"Snippets!" a voice chimed passionately, and suddenly his mouth was
being rather violently crammed with the leaves.
	"Mff...errgh!" Dragohe sputtered, desperately trying to spit the 
herb back at its owner.
	"No, you eat silly! You no die!" said the voice again, this time
more urgently. He swallowed a leaf or two, choked on the rest and sat up,
coughing violently. Blinking his watery eyes he discerned through the tears
the form of a female Leuian, sitting on her knees, both hands resting on
each seperate knee, the left one clutching a green bunch of leaves. Her eyes
were bright and appraising, and she nodded at him approvingly.
	"See? All better."
	Dragohe coughed again, sending a leaf fluttering in her direction.
She laughed and, lightning quick, caught the leaf on an extended claw. She
smiled. Dragohe looked pleadingly over at Cynthia, who was smiling faintly.
Dragohe, lying back down, groaned.
	"NO, no more snippets," and gazed up at Cynthia, who looked rather 
tired. 
	"Feeling better?" she asked, still smiling.
	"Yah," he said, good cheer beginning to return. "Howdja do that 
anyway?" First I was dead and then...Ohh yeah! You're a cleric, right?"
	She nodded. "Order of the Heart."
	"Thas rite," Dragohe remembered, "you heal people and stuff."
	Again she nodded and glanced over at the tomb. The other female 
Leuian, who looked oddly familiar, Dragohe mused, was pushing violently at
the stone slab sealing the tomb and yelling. What she was saying he couldn't
hear clearly, but she seemed rather angry about something.
	"Why didn't you heal yourself before?"
	Cynthia looked back at him, a questioning look on her face.
	"Ya know, when the rogue hit you. You could've just healed yourself
like you did just now."
	"You took care of it just fine," she said, smiling.
	"But don't it hurt now?"
	She looked embarrassed and gazed down at the ground. "I healed it
while we were walking."
	Dragohe opened his mouth to reply when the other Leuian, Miss Snips,
Dragohe wittingly named her, began to stride purposefully over. Grabbing
the Drag-al by the arm she hauled him up quickly and began, unceremoniously,
to drag him over toward the building. Protesting that it was cold and 
whining about the whereabouts of his armor, he was nearly dropped as she
released her iron grip on his arm and stopped in front of the stone slab.
	"You open," she said, pointing purposefully at the slab.
	"Like I know how!" Dragohe snorted, starting to walk back towards
Cynthia's approaching form. The next thing he knew, he was gazing up at Miss
Snips' scowling face, she having tripped him.
	"No go. Push," she said annoyed, pointing at the slab.
	"No," Dragohe said stubbornly, climbing to his feet and going 
towards Cynthia. The previous scene replayed again.
	"Yes," she scowled down at him.
	"Ciiinth," he whined, rolling away from Snips. With a quick pounce
she was beside him, crouching, and he reversed direction and began to roll
the other way, back towards the tomb. Grumbling, he stood up and dusted the
dirt off his chest.
	"What's going on?" Cynthia queried, glancing from Snips to Dragohe.
	"She...she," Dragohe fumed, glaring and pointing at Miss Snips.
	The Leuian grabbed his hand and put it on the side of the slab,
grabbed his other wrist and put it next to the other one.
	"Push!" she said, taking her place above him. He glared up at her
and suddenly remembered who she was.
	"Liv!" he exclaimed, looking up at her. His enthusiasm was not 
returned. She glared, removed his hands and demonstrated violently how to
push with his own arms.
	"You," she said, pulling his hands back, "push!" she yelled, 
thrusting them forward.
	"Hey Livana! It's Dragohe!" he said, extricating himself from her
grasp and waving wildly at her. She looked as if she wasn't going to ask
him (tell him, he grumbled) to push again. He took his prospective place,
and she smiled brilliantly at him.
	"Good!" she applauded, and joined him. Together they shoved at the
slab with all their strength, grunting and puffing. After a few minutes of
futile shoving, Dragohe gasped and collapsed to the ground, panting. Snips,
or Livana, he remembered now, bent over and placed her hands on knees while
calmly sucking in air, gathering strength for another attempt. He gazed at
her, wheezing, eyes drawn towards her battered leather mail. It was very
tight, especially towards the top part of her chest, he noted, and worn. It
had survived more than one battle, from the look of it.
	"Ready?" she said, resuming her place at the slab.
	"Noooh!" Dragohe moaned, still vacumming in air. She sighed and 
folded her arms, looking sadly down at him.
	"You out of shape," she sniffed.
	"Am not!" he protested. He wasn't out of shape, in fact, just merely
pretending to still be tired so as not to have to shove the insufferable
slab again.
	"An lazy," she jabbed again, trying to taunt him to his feet.
	"Am not!" he protested again, this time a little less truthfully.
Suddenly she was kneeling at his side, poking at the pouch strapped to his
belt that was revealed by his lack of armor and shirt.
	"What there?" she queried, looking curiously at the pouch and poking
it with one finger. He didn't answer and started to get up, but she pushed
him down and asked him again. He glared at her and stood up, this time she 
not restraining him but asking him every few moments, what there?, the slab
momentarily forgotten. He sighed and showed her, his first aid materials.
She immediately lost interest and remembered the slab, taking her place.
They both started to push again futilely, and Dragohe swore he thought he 
heard the stone quietly chuckling at him. He began to yell at the slab and 
kick it furiously, his foot bouncing ineffectually off. In mid-kick there
was a sudden click and rumble as the slab slowly and mechanically began to
roll aside, revealing black empty darkness. Dragohe reached for his 
sword automatically and groped air at his side. Glaring down, he only
had time to utter a 'fooey' before something roughly struck him 
around the waist and he lost his breath, falling to the ground with a
heavy weight on him. He winced and covered his face, expecting a blow.
When none came he lowered his hands slightly and opened an eye. Perched
on his stomach was another battle-scarred Leuian clad in leather mail, 
his arm back up in the air, claws extended, about to deliver a strike.
What restrained his arm was Liv's iron grip and shaking head.
	"No, Ty. He friend!"
	The Leuian sitting on his stomach rose smoothly and proffered a
hand to the bemused Drag-al.
	"Sorry then. Thought you were reaching for a weapon."
	Dragohe caught his breath and the Leuians hand and was hauled
to his feet.
	"Tygris," he introduced himself. "I assume you and Livana 
opened the tomb?"
	Livana nodded happily while Dragohe shrugged.
	"Maybe," he said, glancing about for his torch and not finding
it. "You gotta torch?"
	Tygris shook his head yes, saying that he had one left. Dragohe
accepted and lit it, illuminating the inside of the tomb. Surrounding
the entire room were tables with corpses lying on them in various 
states of decay, most of them long since rotted away. The center of the
room held a large table on which was perched various treasures and 
relics. Armor and gold, weapons and shields were modestly arranged 
just-so on the table, items for the dead to use in the next life, 
Dragohe mused. The opening mechanism of the tomb interested him more 
than the treasure, however. It was rather advanced, composed of gears
and pulleys that led somewhere beneath the tomb.
	"This is kinda old," Dragohe said. "We didn't open it, Liv. Who
did?"
	"Um, I think I did," said a timid Cynthia who had wandered in
silently next to Dragohe.
	"I thought I saw someone in a tree nearby, and when I went over
no one was there. My foot kicked on something buried beneath a pile of
leaves, and when I looked down I saw a root that poked out of the 
ground strangely. When I looked back towards you, the tomb was open. I
think maybe it was a lever or something," she said slowly, replaying 
the event in her own mind, after greeting Tygris happily. He nodded and
thanked her and Dragohe, who was half listening. Tygris was then 
dragged off by Livana who was chattering excitedly to him about her 
courageous battle with the wights, acting out the scene of her dodging,
then striking the wight repeatedly. Dragohe, finally called by the 
sparkling treasure, wandered over and began to examine the treasure
while chanting softly "Perusin' the Piles." Cynthia watched him 
withdraw a long, silvery steel saber out of the weapons pile, then
pluck a heavy-looking suit of quartz mail off the table. Dragohe, lips
pursed, began to gaze admiringly at his new replacement items, as 
Cynthia rather violently began pulling at his arm. He glanced up
quickly and noticed the tomb beginning to close, gears and pulleys
moving rather fluidly without a sound. As they dashed for the exit,
Dragohe tripped and fell out of the tomb on top of Cynthia. They lay
there in a heap, Dragohe situated directly over her, his face quite
close to hers. They stayed that way for a stunned moment, he looking
down into her eyes and she up into his. She broke the gaze and said
apologetically, "Um...are you okay?"
	"Yeah," Dragohe said quietly, trailing off as he caught sight 
of Livana and Tygris staring at them questioningly. Dragohe got up
reluctantly and offered her a hand up. She smiled and took it, and he
gently brought her to her feet. Bending down quickly, Cynthia snatched
up his sword and struggled with the mail.
	"Wow...that's heavy," she said as Dragohe lifted it with one
arm, using his knee to balance the heavy quartz as he handed her the 
sword.
	"Yeah, 's probally over a hundred pounds," he said as he 
struggled into the heavy, form hugging mail. She handed back the new
silvery steel saber and he strapped it on where his old saber had been,
and they began to follow the other two Leuians. Dancing around wildly
was Livana, still acting out her great battle against the wights. 
Tygris was watching, an amused yet respectful and interested look on
his face, and Cynthia strode slightly in front of Dragohe, her tail
waving around somewhat, but she wasn't saying anything. Extending his
hand slowly, he brushed the back of his hand against hers. She looked
down, then up at him, took his hand and clasped it tightly as they
walked back towards the town side-by-side.
	"The tavern," Dragohe exclaimed, "sounds reeely good right 
about now."
	"Mmm, and some steak, too," Cynthia purred. "Rare. Without 
peas," she said, making a face at him. Grinning at her, he tried to
step on her foot as they walked, she purring quietly, then deftly
placing her foot atop his and pushing down hard. Suddenly she released
his hand and glared past him. Turning quickly, Dragohe saw the dirt
beneath a grave stirring wildly. Then a rotting hand was shoved up
from beneath the ground, and an awful moaning echoed throughout the
area. A putrid, decomposing zombie pulled itself out of the grave and
began to shamble towards them, losing a few minor appendages but
looking fearsome nonetheless. Dragohe drew his sword and advanced
towards it, calling over his shoulder, "Hold on Cynth, lemme just try
out this sword and then we'll keep going."
	She smiled and shook her head.
