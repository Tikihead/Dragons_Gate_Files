                         Letter From the Editor

  Well, if you are reading this then I must have done something right for a
change. It seems that we finally have our first issue of the DFC availible
to you, our soon to be loyal readers. I would just like to thank 
everyone who helped out in getting this first issue off the ground. Most 
importantly I want to thank our numerous contributors. Without them, this 
would be a very short issue indeed. For those of you who sent something and 
don't see it in this issue....don't give up. It was tough deciding what 
would ultimately get published. To start things off, we have an interview by
a most unlikely interviewer. I feel that one of the greatest services we 
can provide to our readers is knowledge on who it is thats out there. Thus, 
I will try to publish at least one of these interview type articles per 
issue so that more of us can get a better feel for who it is that we share 
this Spur with.
  Then we have a story by Lorelei Nilsfulcentruali detailing her exploits, 
followed by a bit of Wisdom from Felbin the Secian. I will leave it up to 
you to decide just how wise it is possible to be when you have that 
terminaly happy outlook on life so common to Secians.  Rounding out our 
stories we have the birth of a San Elf in Chaos and a glimpse through a 
thieves eyes in The Pick. 
  A new feature that we are adding to the DFC is Sites of Adventure. Each 
issue, we hope to present our readers with a story detailing the background
of, and what to expect in, the various areas around the Spur. Unfortunately,
none of our reporters were willing to contribute anything to this section. 
Thus, I was forced to actually go out there and do some work. Since this is 
only the first issue, I decided that it would be appropriate to do a site 
that was small, and easy to find. Therefore, I choose the shack to the NE 
of the Town Square. In the future, I hope to get more in-depth articles 
detailing sites such as the Haunted House, thieves guild, or graveyard.
  Finally we end things up with Bardic Songs and poems by some of the 
new voices of the Spur, as well as our Staff projects such as 
Guildmasters of Spur, Classifieds, Letters to the Editor and some OOC notes.
Regretfuly, we did not receive a single submision from the new bards of 
the Spur for our Hearthstone Songs. Fortunately, Allandra Shadowfax was able
to write us a nice bit of poetry, which we are sure you will enjoy. All in 
all, I believe it to be an excelent first issue. I hope you agree with me, 
and stick around for the many more to come.
  Finally, before I close up, I want to say thank you to two others. I 
don't know if either one will ever read this, but I borrowed heavily from 
their previous works and I believe that credit should be given. Selder'a, 
Lycosa...thanks for the issues of the FSSC in the old Spur. Without them, I 
would have been even more lost than I am.

                        Inturvue Wid A Draggin
                        By: Crunch Bonebreaker

(Editors note: Due to budget constraints...we were unable to properly edit
this piece. Thus it is presented to you as it was submitted to us. If you 
can't understand it....thats ok, neither could we.)

	In de Spur, dere's nuthin like a draggin.  Ask ennybody, dey kin tell 
ya.  Course, sum of em uses sum choice languige ta cunvey dere pursonul 
feelins bout draggins in genril, but me tinks dats draggins is purty good.  
Ifn ya cook em rite.  Ya gotta cook em slow, er else de meet is tuffer dan 
rogue jerky.  Jus jokin.  Draggins taste terruble, ta tell da truth.  
Once time, me uncle Og et one, but it wuz always tryin ta burn it's way out,
so me aunt Ug cut de durned ting out so uncle Og wouldna keep her wake all 
nite no more.  Now aunt Ug get ta sleep in peace, uncle Og restin in peace, 
an de draggin much happier all de way round.  Least dats wut me ma alwaiz 
told us happent ta uncle Og.  Ennyhow, me had de chance ta talk to one o de 
oldest draggins in Spur, so me figgered mebbe me oughta rite sum of it down 
so sum o youse kin reed bout how de draggins tink an talk an all dat 
cra....er stuff.  Widout furder yappin, heer's me notes from me chat wid 
de draggin, Acinonyx.
	Me seed de draggin fer de furst time in de Town Square.  She wuz 
showin folks round an makin shur dey had wut dey needed ta git by.  Rite 
den, me knowed fer shur she wuz one ta rekon wid.  She wuz too big ta fit 
in a sandwich.  At dat moment, me figgered "So wut.....lotsa lunch meet in 
Spur".  But me seen her in de Haunted House.  She wuz totin more loot dan 
a goblinal kin steel in a month.  Like it wuz nuthin, too.  An watchin 
over a feller dat hadta be new in Spur an a gnat...er seshun, too.  Me sez 
to meself, "Disun noes her bizness".  Den me seen hur in de Graveyard.  
Jus moppin de floor wid a shade.  Whuppin em bad.  Made me stomich growl 
jus watchin it.  Seems like dis draggin wuz all over de Spur.  So den me 
sees hur out south of town.  She's jus up to er ankles in rogue corpses an 
me sez to meself, "Ya gots ta git de story on disun."  Me invited er over 
fer supper.  Mebbe it wuz me breth.  She sed she wuz too bizzy fer it.  So 
finully me runned her down one evenin jus as she wuz gettin reddy ta count 
hur gold.  Dere's safer times ta bug a draggin, lemme tell ya.  An me 
gitted sum answers afore she runned me off, too.  An dis is summ of de 
stuff me lernt.
	Me sez ta hur, "Yer de hed draggin, huh?"
She sez, "If there were a leader, I might be something of one."
	Me sez, "So wut are ya, den?"
She sez, "I am the Loremaster."
	Me sez, "Wut in Taath's taburnackle is dat?"
She sez, "Keeper of the Draconian histories and lore, one who instills in 
          young dragons what it means to be A Dragon."
	Me sez, "Oh."
	Me sez, "So wut ya tryin ta git dun?"
She sez, "I merely seek to live a profitable and happy life in Spur."
	Me sez, "So ya gots enermeez, rite?"
She sez, "I have no enemies, to my knowledge."
	Me sez, "Huh."
	Me sez, "Me alwaiz tought dat draggins wuzn't reely so worried bout 
               laws an stuff like dat.  How cum me seez so many draggins 
               walkin de strait an narro?"
She sez, "Mere convenience.  No dragon wishes to wake knowing that he must 
          kill a companion over an attempt upon hide or hoard.  Disreputable 
          types tend to clump together and behaving in a reputable manner 
          brings one in contact with those disreputable types less often."
	Me sez, "If ya sez so."
	Me sez, "Me herd dere's a sekret Kounsil o Worms.  Wut bout it?"
She sez, "There is no such organization."

	An den she kinda gived me dis look dat made me tink mebbe it wuz time 
fer me ta find sumtin else ta do.  Mebbe it wuz me breth.  Ennyhow, dats 
all me gitted outta hur.  Draggins kin reely clam up if dey wanta.  Sides, 
me wuz bad hongry by den.  Speekin o hongry, me kinda hongry.  Ifn ya 
wanta knoe more, ask fer yerself.  Me gotta find sumtin ta eet.

                             The Meeting 
                             Part 1 of 2
                        
  She could smell his blood. It overwhelmed her sensitive nose; the coppery, 
pungent scent filling her with the desire to feed. It was a residual 
reaction to the days when her people were nothing more than viscous animals,
enhanced to the point of unstoppable power by sentience. Now, of course, she 
never fed on her kills. At least, not that often. Sometimes the bloodlust 
was too great. The urges were strong that night. She fought down the desire
to growl. She managed not to make a sound, although her hackles were raised.
That went unchecked, one of the few reactions that did not disturb the hunt.
To any that could have seen, it might have heralded the fact that the 
muscles on her back were bunched in preparation for a tremendous effort.  
But no one was in the alleyway, and with the moon obscured by the 
neighboring buildings, the pitch black night afforded no view of her.
  She would never know why he came running back. Perhaps he was disoriented.
Perhaps he thought she would never look for him where this battle had begun.
Perhaps he thought that his secret tunnel was incapable of being discovered.
The same nose that had tasted his wounds on the air, however, was wrinkled 
by the man-scent surrounding the trap door. She hadn't bothered with it. 
There was no need to chase her prey to ground, yet.
  He entered the narrow, trash filled corridor in a rush. She stifled a 
laugh as he checked over his shoulder continuously. The fool thought that 
she had chased after him when he had run! Such was not her way.
 The quiet stalk, the ambush from an unexpected direction, these were much 
more effective. Directly in front of him, sliding along the shadows, was his 
hunter. Weakened from a wound to his scalp which bled too freely, and 
harried to the point of panic by her claws, he was unconcerned with 
anything but escape. He began to struggle with the lock on the secret door. 
If he could get to the sewers, perhaps he would live to steal another day.
  The sights, smells, sounds and even tastes of the world fled from her 
mind as she sought her inner center. She had learned a new combination 
that morning, and was anxious to try it out. In that place of unruffled 
calm, the lessons of her instructors were easily recalled. In the blink 
of a slitted eye, she was ready. She leapt.
  The rogue screamed, his eyeballs, as well as the torn vein along his 
forehead, bulging. He dodged to the left as the giant cat kicked upwards 
towards his solar plexus. It missed. But then, it was supposed to. The 
rogue made his fatal error by not continuing the dodge. Instead, he 
switched directions. The downward arc of the axe-kick descended with fierce
suddenness, and the blow meant for his shoulder impacted squarely on the 
back of his neck. He died instantly, but the Leuian did not know that. With 
a fluid grace that had made her instructors eager to have her as a student, 
she finished the maneuver, bringing her other knee smashing into the rogue's
nose. The powerful blow lifted him off the ground, and flung him backwards,
almost to the edge of the street.
  With a sigh of what sounded suspiciously like disappointment, the cat 
collected her breath. The hunt was over. There would be many more this 
night. There would be too many to count before she faced Taath in his Halls 
of Judgment. But still, a small trace of regret that it was finished ran 
through her. She didn't know if perhaps this feeling was something 
left over from an evolution which had made the Leuians some of the 
fiercest fighters in Dragon's Gate. Whatever the case, she savored it, 
as she savored all of life. Allowing herself another small sigh, she moved
to strip the body. Hopefully, this one would add to the pile of spoils that 
she had waiting. She hated money, but she needed it.
  She was pleased to discover the rogue carried a dirk. It would 
fetch enough silvers to make a large donation at the temple. Taath was 
an unforgiving, if fair, god. She had no intention of giving him reason to 
cast an angry eye towards her. Most of her money went to the temple 
coffers. She had ambitions, and the temple was her means to that end. 
The silvers that meant nothing to her were a very small price to pay.
  She found the small purse and emptied it. She left the rogue where he 
was. Other thieves would be frightened by the corpse. They would wonder 
what had come to the hunting ground, and reversed the roles they had 
chosen. Frightened prey made mistakes. Mistakes made the hunt easier, to 
say nothing of safer. She turned, preparing to leave.
  A sudden noise startled her, and sent her into a low crouch. She quickly 
identified it as clapping. Loud applause rang from the stone walls 
surrounding her. The source of the sound came around the corner, and she 
found herself face to face with a young dragon. He grinned at her, looking 
unconcerned at her battle posture.
  "Very nice work, young lady," he spoke, too loudly. She was instantly 
aware of the fact that other rogues were about, and that the second exit 
from her position was into the sewers. She began to growl as he spoke 
again. "I really enjoy watching you work. Allow me to introduce myself. 
My name is Arrrg, I'm a dragon." He smiled again, bowing slightly from the 
waist.
 
                          To be continued...

                               CHAOS

  Torrents of rain slashed through the cold night air and pounded into the 
ground.  Upon a wide, open field, thunder echoed through the air, resounding
against the ancient trees of the surrounding forest, as lightning danced 
and flickered among the dark clouds.  No merchants wandered about selling 
their wares this night; adventurous souls were found to be nestling in 
front of a blazing fire; and even the immoral rogues had ceased stalking 
their unsuspecting victims this dark and stormy night.
  The storm continued to rage on, seemingly venting its anger, almost as if 
it were a living thing.  And indeed, the incessant howling of the wind 
caused everyone, even those sheltered safely within their homes, to think 
that the dead themselves had risen up from their tombs to walk the world 
again.  That event was of itself possible, for the world had not been the 
same since the abrupt departure of the powerful deity, Death.  A dying 
loved one's last breath could very well be prolonged so that it might never 
come.  A tormented companion's fatal wound might torture them forever, for 
what other outlet is there to end unspeakable pain, other than the eternal 
peace of death?  But now, Death has ventured into the void, and as of yet 
has not returned to his fellow deities and the peoples of this world. With 
the call of Death no longer certain, the world is no longer balanced.
  And it is among this imbalanced world, this turmoil, where Chaos can 
thrive.  The wars, the hatred, the infamous "Unmagick" of the Penthanians, 
the racial prejudices, are all ingredients that can be stirred into the pot 
of turmoil.  Perhaps the storm is simply an expression of the confusion upon
the world today.  Or perhaps there is a purpose to the storm...
  In the storm filled sky, an arc of lightning jumped from cloud to cloud, 
never seeming to dissipate.  All at once, dozens of tiny arcs of blue-white 
lightning appeared and began to coalesce onto one single cloud, forming a 
brilliant circle of light.  And in the center of this circle, the focus of 
the arcs.  They seemed to pulse and writhe, their energy seemingly flowing 
into the focus of the circle.  A bulge begins to form, the result of the 
amassing of such terrific energies.  Thunder now rocks the open field 
continuously, sending reverberations through the ground.  The bulge of 
energy grows larger, apparently preparing to release its pent up force.
And finally, it does.
  From within the bulge, a tremendous bolt of lightning bursts out and 
smashes into the ground, sending streams of lightning in all directions 
upon the ground, forming the image of a brilliant wheel and its spokes upon 
the surface of the field.  The entire, engulfed in shadows just seconds 
before, is now bathed in a blue-white brilliance.  And within the center of 
the field, the "hub" of the wheel, can be seen the silhouettes of three 
forms.  Appearing to be insubstantial and ethereal at first, the silhouettes
eventually begin to grow in definition and gain substance.  And in the 
blink of an eye, it is over.  Every bolt of lightning has vanished, the 
ground left unscarred by its ordeal, the skies quiet, even the clouds gone, 
revealing the tiny, twinkling dots that were known as stars. A full moon 
hung in the sky, shedding a pale white light down into the field.  And 
there within the beam of moonlight, were three figures.  Two of these were 
standing about, apparently staring at each other.  The other form seemed to 
be a stone.
  Alone in the field without a stitch of clothes on, the two figures 
continued to examine one another.   Each seemed to have depthless black 
pits where their eyes should have been, and hair to match that.  Their skin 
was dark as well, suitable for blending into the shadows.  But, the shorter 
one had strange shapes and figures scrawled all over his well-muscled form. 
Runes.  The markings of a runemage.
  The taller one abruptly broke off his gaze and looked at what he could 
now see was an egg.  Turning his gaze once more to his companion, he smiled 
broadly, turned his back, and fled into the night.  The shorter figure 
shrugged slightly as his eyes followed the running form of the other, then 
shifted to the egg.  Reaching out his hand, he felt the leathery surface of 
the large egg.  Hmmm, a dragon egg.  And apparently born of that storm, he 
thought.  This one's going to be a powerful one.  I wonder what will become 
of this one.  A shrug of his shoulders caused his black hair to rise for 
an instant, then fall to his shoulders again.  As for the rest of the world,
lets see how it handles Oryn Runestone...he inclined his head downward...
after he acquire some proper attire...  After whispering the spidery 
language known to the rest of the world as magick, a shining halo of runes 
coalesced above his head, and the runes upon his body gleamed slightly.  He 
raised his right hand to his head, the index and middle finger touching his 
forehead, and the night swallowed him.
  San elves, according to their cousins the Usil elves, are not even 
relatives of the Usil and Fir elves.  Instead, it is said that the Lords of 
Chaos created the San to wreak havoc upon the world.  That, of course, is 
not entirely true...
	The San were not created by Lords of Chaos.  
	They are Chaos.


	In the middle of the field, a crack formed on the dragon egg...

                                  The Pick

  He wasn't scared, and he never would be. After all, he had been dead 
before, and probably would be again. But each time, he learned a little bit 
more. Each time, he became a little bit harder to kill. Someday, many 
months, maybe years, from now they would all regret not paying more respect 
to him!
  He sighed, almost loud enough for the fat merchant to hear him. That was a 
long time away. His target glanced around for a moment, before stepping up 
to the counter of the bank. Hopefully to withdraw a great deal of money. 
Death insurance was not cheap.
  The thief kept to the shadows, waiting nervously for the trader to 
reappear. He ignored the flow of traffic around him, his mind made up. He 
would not make the mistake of switching plans in the middle of an attempt. 
  The merchant waddled away from the teller and hurried out, to the west. 
His movements, deceptively quick for such an overweight man, showed his 
fear. Perhaps he was carrying large sums after all! For a moment, the thief 
dared to feel hope. He followed quickly, his stealth keeping him well 
hidden.
  The target darted left and right, using a zig-zag route in an attempt to 
throw off any who might be following. But the thief had played this game 
many times, and knew the merchant's final destination. As the pair reached 
the gate to the Bazaar, the thief darted forward. His hands moved of thier 
own accord, darting into the purse on the fat hip, coming away with a 
handful of gold.
  The merchent continued through the gate, not noticing that his purse had 
become lighter. He was in for a nasty suprise, the thief mused, when he 
arrived at the shop. With a spring in his step, the smiling pickpocket  
turned back towards the bank, ready to enrich his account. He barely 
managed to jump back out of the way of the descending axe.
  "A thief, eh?" snarled the guardsman in front of him. "I am thinking you 
won't pick honest men's pockets quite so well after I cut off your hands!" 
Another vicous swipe accompinied the threat, and again, a quick dodge to 
the side was all that saved him. He came up out of the roll quickly, and 
ran east, dodging passersby.
  The guard followed, shoving the curious bystanders aside, growling all 
the while. The growls turned to sounds of frustration when his quarry 
disappeared in the middle of Town Square. He searched for a few moments, 
and then wandered off. A quick thief was too much work, and a cold ale was 
needed. But if he ever saw him again...
  Behind the statue, the thief smiled, and counted his new-found gold.

                               The Shack

                               *History*

  Today, let me tell you about an old Shack that sits to the Northeast of 
the Town Square. It is easy to find. Simply go to the Spur's Town Square, 
and head Northeast untill you find a tunnel. Going through this tunnel, you 
will see the rotting remains of one of the first buildings ever to be built 
in the Spur. If you search around a bit here, you may find a trapdoor. 
This trapdoor leads down into the cellar of the shack. Amazingly, after all
these years, the cellar has not yet fallen in on itself.
  This shack was built when the Town Square was just a meeting between two 
roads. There was no mighty city sprawling in all directions, as there is 
now. This land was all part of the Rijjom nation, covered by grassy plains.
Slowly though, as civilized races moved in, a city began to form. Not the 
beautiful city that you see now, but a city of ramshackle huts and hovels. 
  Many different races came to this place, hoping to find their fortunes. 
Their were Pentathians, Frontacians, Dragons, and all the others. There was 
also a small family of Psycians. This was in the days before great war when
the Frontacians obliterated the Psycian homeland with their swift and 
terrible magicks. 
  These Psycians had built there home and now provided a valuable service to 
the many new comers to the Spur. They would, for a price, enable newly 
arrived citizens to contact there loved ones which they had left behind. 
Charging a reasonable rate, the Psycians slowly began to settle into their
new home. 
  The Psycian family would perhaps have lived happily, and gone on to 
contribute much to the building of the Spur, if it wasn't for the hatred 
of the Frontacians. For, on that bloody day, when Frontacians used there 
mighty Magicks to obliterate the Psycian homeland, assasins were dispatched
to slay any Psycians they could find. One such group of Frontacians were 
sent to the newly formed Spur. These blackhearted killers snuck into the 
Psycian's home and murderd the entire family. Eight souls perished that 
night in addition to the millions elsewhere. The Frontacians killed 
everyone from the Elderly Grandfather, to the newly born 7 month old child.
Mother, Father, brothers and sisters all died that night. 
  The next day, the people of the new Spur found out about the bloody nights
work. The Frontacians had planned well though. For several months they had 
been spreading rumors and lies about the Psycians. Thus, when the people 
found out what had happened, few were ready to denounce the Frontacians. 
Even fewer were ready to speak out once they learned that such things could
also happen to them and their famillies. 
  Due to the peoples fear then, and the Frontacians hatred, the bodies of 
the Psycian family were never laid to rest. The Frontacians left the shack 
standing, a grisly reminder to all those who saw it. Slowly the Spur built 
itself up, extending out in all directions...except one. No pathway was
ever built past that shack. No other building was ever errected on that 
piece of land. 
  Years later, when the Psycians finally returned, they sensed the evil that
had been wrought in this place. They knew, through there own specialized
psychic abilities, what had happened here. Thus, when they formed their own
guild, they built it in remembrance near the shack, and not in the Guild
Square where tradition demanded it be.
  And still it stands. The old Shack, abandoned by all. Its cellar now 
serves as a holding place for some of the thieves guild ill-gotten loot. 
The thieves who travel there must beware though, for it is haunted still 
by the skeletons of that first family of Psycians. Victims of a hatred 
which they could never understand.

                            *Description*

Recomended for: Newbies, lvl 4 or less
  

  The shack itself is an uninteresting place to go. The cellar is where all 
the action is. Down in the cellars you will find many Rats, Rodents, and 
of course, the skeletons. The skeletons are by far the most difficult 
opponent, and the only ones with any treasure. These skeletons usualy wield
Flails, Hammers, and Axes. You can get a good price for the Hammers and 
Flails from the weapons dealers, though the Axes do not fetch nearly as 
much. Each skeleton also carries with him a few silver. No matter how many
times one destroys these things though, there are always more. These 
Psycians seem cursed to constantly rise up again and again to attack any
who enter there home. 
  If you look around, you will also notice many different boxes and barrels.
These are all minor items which the Thieves Guild stores here for later use.
There is nothing of real value here though, so searching through the 
merchandise will bring you nothing except possibly the anger of the 
Thieves, should you be caught. 
  The cellar itself is straightforward, and easy to navigate. Provided 
is a simple map of the place, although I am sure that none is truly needed.

                               #

  As you can see, there are only 4 rooms to the cellar itself. Each one 
seems able to generate skeletons, rats, and rodents. I hope you find the
Shack a more interesting site to explore and adventure in now that you know
a bit about its history. Good hunting, and good luck.

By Allandra Shadowfax, Psycian Cleric of the Heart  


Spur's Lost Souls

Up a dim laneway
round the next bend,
Dodging the shadows,
just don't turn your head.

Gripping your broadsword,
sweat on your brow,
You meet the first vermin
and teach him to bow.

Ahead, only darkness,
behind, just a howl;
With barely a light-source
you shiver and scowl.

No dragon to help thee,
no friends in the mist,
What silver you'd pay now
for even a ghost!

Your broadsword is cracking,
cloak's shredded and torn;
if only they'd warned you
when you were first born.

The journey's a long one
chill, bitter, and dank;
Far worse, you lay sleepless,
no gold in the Bank!

The healers ignore you,
the fighters race by
And even the Mages
won't blink an eye.

Magick eludes you,
weapons don't wield,
The Elders are busy
and monsters won't yield.


Oh, where is that Archway,
that portal, I thought...;
I'm spinning in circles,
it's all been for naught.

With sighs and hard shoulders,
you head through the gate;
War-weary and bruised now,
you'll just ponder your fate.

                          Letters to the Editor

WRITTEN IN STONE........
   On an Isle far away, in an era long past, a wise and gifted magickal race 
was virtually massacred from existence.  History chronicles this profound 
tragedy of the Psycian people as perpetrated by imperial Frontacians.  To 
this day, Psycians swear an abiding oath to obliterate all Frontacians (or, 
at the very least, to avoid them like  plague).   Tragically, that animosity
still disrupts the fine fabric of communication expected between our world's
highly civilized peoples.
  Although it seems only a dragon's breath away, that epoch is truly long 
gone.  As a Psycian Cleric of the Heart, my soul shudders at the mere 
thought of perpetuating such hatred.  How ironic that I have an equally 
sworn oath to foster peace and healing!
  There must be a way to reverse the scars of time, a gate to bridge the gap 
between our two noble peoples (the term noble is here used loosely).   
Fellow Psycians, I beseech you from my heart with these probing questions:
1.  How deeply do you want revenge?
2.  Yet, how deeply can you embrace mercy?
  With regret, I realize that some of my Guild brothers and sisters might 
find the concept repulsive.  Perhaps they may even vote to banish me from 
the realm for even thinking the questions.  But prior to such drastic 
recommendations, consider this:  vengeance is a dish served icily cold, 
while forgiveness warmly heals its sender.  It is time to acknowledge that 
not all members of an Imperialist structure are followers of its propaganda.
And, perhaps most significantly, history unchallenged becomes history 
repeated.
  How much better that the Elven Archives could read  'the magnificent 
Psycians, in their infinite wisdom, extended a hand of friendship to their 
mortal villains the Frontacians, changing the course of the world',  than 
to hear the repeated tales of seething hatred throughout our history.
  Through humble experience, I have already softened my firm beliefs about 
the enemy.   Upon my early and somewhat precipitous arrival to Spur, one 
reluctant Frontacian set aside his worries to protect me, heal me, instruct 
me, and 'befriend' me (for want of a more palatable word to the 
faint-hearted).  This enemy displayed wisdom, compassion, wit, kindness, 
humour, trustworthiness, and chivalry.  What  more could be asked of a 
friend or kinsman?

  Friends, the time has come to peel back the pages of time, root deeply, 
and seek newer, wiser answers for the next Spur millennium and future 
generations.  Not long ago, I stumbled upon an aging parchment that held a 
profound message in an ancient tongue.  Roughly translated, it said --
Water wears down a rigid rock, pebble by pebble,
but a pliable tree bends with the flow, and survives;
Yet, above all, the eternal river endlessly 
shapes itself
over and around every obstacle.

One final question for the Frontacians:  What will you equally pledge to 
heal our grievous wounds and jointly rewrite what once was? 


                                                Sincerly,
                                                Allandra Shadowfax

How to be Omnipotent(Or at least stop being such a pain)
By Torye Notamos

  There is a little known secret here in Dragon's gate. From looking around 
at the posts, and some of the conversations within town, it's obvious that 
someone needs to break the silence! If I don't start letting the Khat out of 
the bag, shooting straight, and cutting the bull, there are going to be a 
lot of newbies out there who will be left out in the rain.
  Pardon me for a moment while I restock on metaphors. Ok, all set. Where 
was I? Oh yes.
  This little known secret can not only make you friends and influence 
people, it can save your life! I am not exagerating when I say that without 
the use of this little-known trick, you could find yourself attacked on all 
sides!
  What is it? Come closer, and I'll tell you. It's the Caps Lock key! You no 
longer have to have everything you say come OUT LIKE THIS! Just by learning 
to toggle this particular switch to the off position, you can give people 
exactly what they most desire; peace and quiet! Some of you are apparently 
unaware that all Caps speaking is considered yelling. Want to know why that 
Hand Cleric keeps smashing your head in? Let me show you.

  WILL SOMEONE PLEASE HELP ME I DONT KNOW HOW TO PLAY THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!

  See how hard on the eyes that can be? Imagine that scrolling by on 
everyone's screen, causing them to cry out in pain and anguish! Now imagine 
the entire Spur population hunting you down and killing you. If that isn't 
enough, imagine someone cutting and pasting it to TOS! Oh, the horror of it 
all! And all because you can't find the Caps lock key!
  It doesn't have to be that way. Look down at your keyboard. Find the 
spacebar. That's the long key right in the middle at the bottom. Now, move 
along the bottom of the keyboard to your left. Which way is left? Uhm... Oh,
I know. Look at this:

        Left                            Right

  Good! Now move left until you have reached the end of the keyboard. If 
you reach wood, papers, or a Pepsi can, you have gone too far. That's your 
desk, not the keyboard. Stay on the keyboard itself, ok? Now, move up until 
you see the "Caps Lock" key. Up? You want to know which way is up? ::sigh::
     
         Up is this way.          Down is this way.
           
If you see the word "Tab" you have gone too far. If you see the word "Shift"
you have not gone far enough. What are tab and shift? Don't worry, we will 
get to the advanced stuff later! Is anyone not at the caps lock key? Raise 
your hand. Hands? Those things at the end of your arms. Ok, those of you 
who raised your hands, go back and read the directions over again. The rest 
of you, come with me.
  Press the "Caps Lock" once. By once I mean press it, then don't press it 
again. Now try typing. 
  If your writing comes out like this, it is off:
                i really like to whisper to people
  If you writting looks like this, then it is on:
                I REALLY LIKE TO YELL AT PEOPLE
  If you are talking like that, press it again. By again I mean press it a 
second time and then stop. Make sure it is off, ok? This will save your 
life, trust me.
  See you next issue, when we discuss the shift key, and perhaps, if you 
are good, punctuation.

P.S. There is currently a shortage in exclamation points in Dragon's Gate. 
I beg your pardon? ::sigh:: An exclamation point looks like this:   !
Anyway, the Elders apparently forgot to stock up on them. So until 
Beta-testing is over, we are asking everyone to conserve them. Try to use 
only one, or at the most three, per sentence, ok?
