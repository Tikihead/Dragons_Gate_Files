Letter from the Editor

Greetings Citizens of the Spur, I am proud to take up the spot that Ragarn has left vacant and to continue his duties as Editor in Chief of the DFC. It has been somewhat hectic lately, as you have or have not noticed a lack of the past DFC. I am working on correcting, or at least including some of the features that were to be in the last issue, to include the Top 5 and some other timely materials. I have lost some staff, I have gained some staff, and Allandra has stayed with me. There will be a few more additions, and changes to the DFC you will be seeing in this issue and in issues to come. This issue will be dedicated to the Bards of Spur mainly, with a few other stories to add in. This issue may turn out to be one of the largest issues for now, but that's something of an attempt to make up for the lack of the last issue. I think that about covers it, I have received many stories from you all. So if you do not see it in this one, it will be in the next one, and who knows, if all goes well, and people keep up, I will start a weekly or every two week DFC, it's up to you, the viewer to decide. I have received a warm welcome from many people upon reaching this job, and I thank you all for your kind words and encouragement. I shall do my best to entertain you and keep you informed.

For the Bards,
Michael

Agravynn and Larkk
An original song by Marigold Lyrian

Sit back, my friends, and listen here,
For I've a song to spin;
Come, don't be shy, now, gather round,
For the tale of Larkk, and Agravynn.

Two kindred spirits trapped in time,
A legend of their love,
A tale of tenderness sublime,
And fragile as a dove.

Once they called him Agravynn the Black,
To the night his heart was lost,
And to the world he turned his back,
Eyes turned to mirrors, chill with frost.

None knew what drove this dragon's soul
To drown in shadows deep,
And only one could e'er console
His secret, bitter grief.

The dragons chose a little one
To save him from the dark,
Eyes glowing like rubies, hair likened to sun,
The most gentle of Secians, was Larkk.

As Agravynn gazed one night upon the stormy seas,
He felt a gentle hand upon his arm
And turned, with a roar like an icy breeze,
To someone even he would never harm.

When she lifted her eyes to meet his own,
Her pity made him flinch,
And at the softness of her tone,
His stony heart was wrenched.

Her voice was like an angel's song
As she whispered in his ear,
"Dear sweet one, you've been dead too long,
Too long was love your greatest fear."

Day by day, like a flame from above,
She melted his wall of ice,
Until he thrived upon her love
Where once, hate had sufficed.

The two were never seen apart
From that chill evening hence,
And the bond they formed between their hearts
Has been a legend, ever since.

He soon formed wings of dark, tough leather,
She taught him how to fly,
He took her hand, and they soared together
Into the star-filled sky.

The tale should end there without pain or spilt blood,
But alas all joy comes to an end;
And it grieves me to say that the world was not good
To precious Larkk and Agravynn.

Many years later they soared though the air,
Secian and dragon full-grown,
For he would not leave his Chosen fair
To live his life alone.

They came upon a battle raging,
And, quick as a lightning streak,
Bold Agravynn dove down and took to engaging
The tormentors of the weak.

But with a vicious twist of fate,
His own strength began to fail-
The Larkk appeared, before 'twas too late
To heal her dragon's ails.

She couldn't stand the violence,
But she wouldn't let him die,
So she bore the pain in silence
Even as tears filled her eyes.

Then down came steel blades crashing,
Aimed to fell the dragon brave,
But Agravynn took not a slashing-
By a Secian he was saved.

Larkk threw herself beneath the blades
And there she died for him;
Slumped in his arms her body lay,
Flesh cold, eyes dull, arms limp.

Then Agravynn was filled with rage
That was terrible, crimson, dark,
He slew the whole army, each knight and runemage
With a wild, aching cry, "For Larkk!"

When the battle was over he lifted his Larkk
In a grasp so eternally tender,
And carried her into the calming dark-
Never once was his lonely walk hindered.

He carried her up to a high, grassy peak
And laid her amidst soft white flowers,
And kissed her dry and sallow cheek..
And knelt, and wept for hours.

They say that dragons cannot die,
But I know it isn't true,
For without Larkk, Agravynn could not survive,
And he died of a heart torn in two.

Who knows if they soar together now,
Upon the starry wind?
I'd like to believe that it happened, somehow,
And these two are joyous, once again...

I'd tell another tale, dear friends,
But the hour is much too late,
Though this ballad has a peculiar end
Which I feel I must relate.

There is a rose atop Larkk's Peak
Whose blossom never dies-
Even in the midst of winter bleak,
It shines like a glorious sunrise.

Those who know the legend are aware
Of why it sheds such light-
The Rose of Larkk's Peak was planted there
By Agravynn......The Bright.

A Bardic Tale
by Noerdih Arahz

A light breeze would be felt by any onlookers, and the same could watch the sun as it lowered beyond the horizon.  Onlookers there were not, and the two figures, standing in front of a lone stone protruding from the ground, would have the next moments to themselves.

"We shall begin now dear, in the presence of your father as tradition requires," spoke one of the two, a human who had seen many winters come and go, and many important events come and go, but who kept her eyes transfixed upon this moment, as attentive as possible.

"I pledge that I will wield Father's blade with dignity and as I see that he would have done, knowing best..." began the smaller figure eagerly, akin in manner to a young soldier reciting the oath of acceptance into a legion.

"Do not jump into such promises, dear," the boy was silenced in mid-phrase as the other spoke.  "It was not your father's wish that you carry his sword, or that you have a future in slaughter."

"But all my friends are getting blades, grandmother!  I do so wish for a blade."

"If that is the case, we will stop at the armory before the day's end."  At this the younger appeared somewhat relieved.  "But your rite of age will yet occur.  For your father wished for you his lyre."

"Lyre?  You mean to say that father was a minstrel?"

"Young these days," the elder woman sighed, "a Bard.  He was a Bard, dear."

The younger seemed to turn this information about his head.  "So what did he do?  What does a Bard do?"

"Why, a bit of everything, dear.  Your father worked channeling magick along with sword, and even did some less savory things in his lifetime.  The most important work of a Bard, though, is his music.  The sounds of a good Bard can have the power of any wound or spell.  A Bard can make things happen with much more style than one of another Guild, as well."

"That would be wonderful to watch, grandmother!" eagerness showing plainly upon the face of the boy, "Why is it that I've not seen a Bard do such things?"

"A Bard does not crave power as that.  The power springs from emotion, like the magick of runespells you have seen springs from the mind.  The beauty of the song and the feeling of need will take care of what must be done.  The skill lies not in the instrument, but in the person who plays it.  Perhaps this has been forgotten in the haste of many to become more.  You would do well to remember it also, dear."

With that the boy looked about the stone and found a slight rise of dirt to one side.  Brushing at it with his hand, he uncovered with delight but much sadness, a small and plain chest.  Opening it with a hand, he withdrew a lyre.  It was not particularly worthy of note in size, shape, or beauty; but it was held with a loving hand.

"That which you hold was very important to your father.  It was always kept safe.  He played it at the evening of his wedding, and played it as he and your mother were dying of the plague," the last bit was spoken by the woman with a quiet sob, after which she continued unnecessarily, "Treat it with care, dear."

The evening readily gave way to night, and the two humans readily grew tired in limb.  Their hearts and spirits, however, were awake and aware.  Eventually they left the burial site and moved into land inhabited, approaching soon the town armory.

"I think I'll pass on the blade, grandmother," spoke the younger, though already seeming somewhat older by the mere look about his eyes.  With a thoughtful glance downward he explained, "I think there will be plenty to keep me busy for a time."

That same night, all those of the town would sleep and think nothing but that which their dreams would bring...except for one.  He lifted a lyre from a small chest, and placing a hand upon it, played a single, low note.  As it sang, he was acutely aware of a single tear; forming in his eye.

The Paratwa Files
(note from Editor-I didn't edit a thing.)

DoctorStrange says, "I have a small test interview for the DFC would you mind being my subject? I have only 3 questions prepared for test"

Paratwa says, "Shoot when you are ready."

Paratwa grins.
 
DoctorStrange says, "Honorable Paratwa I believe you can shed some light among the cobwebs of mystery that abounds about the Pride."

DoctorStrange says, "As the newly elected Khatyr to the Pride. Could you express your beliefs on what you perceive the Pride being now? "

DoctorStrange says, "and what you hope for the Pride to be in the days ahead?"

Paratwa sits down.

Paratwa says, "I see the Pride in a general state of change at the moment."

Paratwa says, "Though that is slowing down a bit."

Paratwa says, "Thank god."

Paratwa says, "We keep trying to get things right, IE, sponsoring someone into the Pride, times, and general issues of politics."

Paratwa says, "Takes a bit, But I think we are doing a bit better than we were before."

DoctorStrange nods.

Paratwa says, "As far as the future of the Pride..."

Paratwa says, "I would like to see us become more active within the Spur, with more Pride activities such as hunts, and a more active policing role among the Spur's citizen's."

DoctorStrange nods.

DoctorStrange says, "There have been rumors of discontent over politics inside the Pride. 

DoctorStrange says, "Can you tell the readers your views on these rumors and any truths they may have?"

Paratwa says, "Not so much as everyone arguing constantly, but some argue a bit, but in any large group of people there will be arguments"

DoctorStrange nods.

Paratwa says, "The problem is not politics, but a few indiscreet actions by a far little few people."

Paratwa says, "Normally it is just a mistake on their part and it is worked out."

Paratwa says, "Someone is going to have a different opinion on everything, we try to work to a middle ground with such things."

Paratwa says, "That is just the way things are."

Paratwa nods.

Paratwa says, "Not everyone is going to agree constantly"

Paratwa says, "Does this answer your question? If not tell me."

DoctorStrange says, "I think it does yes."

DoctorStrange says, "I did a little reading of the Tome of Honor to get to know a little on Leuian custom."

DoctorStrange says, "Would you be willing to explain a few things in more details so the readers may understand your ways better?"

Paratwa laughs.

Paratwa says, "Of course."

Paratwa coughs.

Paratwa says, "Which part Do you have a question about?"

DoctorStrange says, "Your belief of Kit'Gia "

Paratwa says, "What about it?"

DoctorStrange says, "How does that compare with other races views on their young?"

DoctorStrange says, "and do you think the Pride has upheld this belief in recent past?"

Paratwa says, "Most races that I know of do not even try to help their young, except for perhaps the dragon's."

Paratwa says, "I firmly believe that more can and should be done to help our young."

Paratwa says, "I firmly believe that more can and should be done to help our young."

Paratwa says, "I think more will be done in the future for our younger Kit's."

Paratwa says, "I am setting up a meeting on every other Tuesday at the gilded lion's Inn, for younger Khats and older Pride members to get together and help the young."

Paratwa says, "The first one should be this Tuesday."

DoctorStrange says, "That sounds like a good thing indeed"

Paratwa says, "Other than that, I generally stress to everyone I know the importance of teaching our young whenever they have the time, and even when they don't have the time."

Paratwa says, "It is a duty, we as Pride member's must uphold."

DoctorStrange says, "I believe it is a duty we as sentients must uphold."

Paratwa nods up and down at DoctorStrange.

Paratwa says, "I do not limit myself to only helping young Leuian's, but helping my own kyn is a must, the other is just my general desire to see everyone well off and educated about the ways of the lands."

Paratwa says, "Leuian's however are a priority to myself."

Paratwa says, "Though I have been known to have a very soft spot in my heart for Secian's as well."

Paratwa grins.

DoctorStrange says, "Yes they seem to charm everyone"

Paratwa says, "Either that or drive them mad."

Paratwa smiles.

DoctorStrange says, "I am always ducking gems being thrown to them"

DoctorStrange laughs.

Paratwa grins.

Paratwa says, "Any other question's I could help you with or clarify something I said?"

DoctorStrange says, "No I believe I have enough for a sample"

DoctorStrange says, "If I edit right it may even go in the DFC"

DoctorStrange chuckles.

Paratwa nods up and down.

Paratwa grins.

Paratwa says, "I know the DFC editor very well if you need any help speaking with him."

DoctorStrange says, "As the interview drew to a close and Paratwa rose to leave. A shape formed and Paratwa disappeared shouting death to you foul demon of lag!!!"

The Dream
by Teldor Whitetalon

Being a young dragon, I was utterly amazed at the sights and sounds of the Training Ground outside of Spur.  I went to the east to practice skill with the sword and channeling abilities.  A few other races were there in the training facilities with the targets just begging to be knocked down.  I began to claw and breathe fire at the target and to my embarrassment, all of the other races were rolling on the floor laughing. (I could swear even the target was quietly snickering.)  Except for one aged dragon dressed in a flowing midnight blue robe holding a gnarled oak staff.  The dragon motioned me to the next room, smiled and said in Dragon, "Greetings, young dragon.  Dreaming about second and third stage, are we?" The sound of her voice had a calming reverberance about it.  She gave a wry but understanding smile. "Well, yes...", I said sadly.  "Being a dragon,", she said, "you will be a powerful fighter and runemage.  You will be able to kill an Ancient Yelican with two swipes from your claw, and cause horrific damage with your breath attacks while flying.  Young dragon, these things will come later as you metamorphose.  However, you should school yourself well on learning how to battle and defend, and on channeling right now."  Then, I heard someone say telepathically, "Emergency in Town Square...  Need help, please..."  Just as I turned around to tell her, she said, "Yes, I know."  And with that, runes began to form above her head, a bright flash, and then she was gone.   I heard another telepathic message that  said, "Farewell, young dragon, be careful.  Remember to link..."  Link? Hmm... He concentrated on her smiling face and made his first link.  He thought, "Will I ever see you again?"  A reply came, "Indeed.  We will talk again before going though the Great Change." "The Great Change?", he thought.  She linked, "Yes, before undergoing your change from first stage to second."

His mind was a blur thinking about all she had said.  Yelicans? He has only heard such things whispered in myths.  His mother had teased, "Be careful, or the Yelicans will getcha!"  She did, however, glanced around after saying that.  His father said, "Yelicans?"  He chuckled staring sternly at Mother.  "Why, that's just a fable..."  Or, was it? Demons, Yelicans, saber-toothed bunnies--- hrm, he wasn't sure where fantasy left off and reality began.  As he was sleeping, he was visited by the elder dragon again.  "Come with me, I will show you a few of the creatures you might be facing.  She picked him up effortlessly and with her great wing span, whooshed him away.  It seemed like only a few minutes when they arrived at their first sojourn.  The speed and height at which they traveled made him quiver and his eyes dry out and burn.  He saw thieves casting spells, rogues fighting rogues, and muggers trying to hide in the shadows.  Without thinking, he drew his bark training sword and sliced at one of the rogues.  Now, it would have been perfect stroke nearly decapitating the rogue, however, the sword passed right though his neck and he toppled down.  The older dragon merely chortled and said, "Remember where you are, young dragon...in bed...asleep...this is all a dream..."  She grinned wryly.  He blushed profusely, sheathed his sword and then she whisked him away towards their next stop.

When they reached their destination, his hair was standing on end and he shivered.  A baby Yelican lumbered in to the cove and he shrieked. The newborn Yelican was ferocious looking with rows of razor sharp teeth and talons.  It was tremendous in size in mass, and when it stood on it's hind legs, it was taller than he.  The elder dragon said, "Ancient Yelicans are quite a bit larger and much more deadly."  Just then, an ancient Yelican meandered into the den.  He yelped and stood frozen. It's teeth and talons were about the size of his bark training sword and he stood transfixed as the ancient Yelican gave a huge deafening roar. "Just clearing it's throat." he thought.  "Yes." came the reply.  She smiled at him and swept him away again towards their third stop.
	
He had only just got over his fright when he felt a blast of heat from the place where they were landing.  Three demons sauntered in.  They had small but deadly claws and they were partially covered with fire. One demon looked straight at the young dragon, grinned wickedly, and runes began circling above the demon's head.  The young dragon screamed so loud, as the fire sphere exploded on him, that he woke himself up in a cold sweat.

Shivering, he stood up and glanced around warily.  "Just a horrible nightmare ... sheeze...," he thought.  Just then, he felt he wasn't alone.  In one fluid motion, he drew his bark training sword, whirled around and caught the elder dragon full in the torso.  The sword splintered into bits and pieces as the elder dragon raised an eyebrow and then chuckled.  He apologized several hundred times to her and then she spoke, "Young dragon, your reflexes are quick...good...very good.  You shall need it."  She continued, "The creatures you saw in your dream were but a few of the dangers you will face in your journeys.  We are a proud people, having no quarrel with any other races.  You should befriend a Secian... they can be an immense help to you, young dragon. Going though the great change or metamorphosis to second stage alone may kill you.  You need a Secian to go through the great change with you. She paused then spoke slowly, "Our race worships no Gods, so we must be extremely self reliant and this might be an exceptional hardship for a young dragon like yourself, nevertheless, with a good deal of training, practice and especially age, you will be able to overcome these hardships and persevere... only if you have dogged patience and persistence," she added.  The youth listened intently and pondered about all the training, all the different herbs to increase his abilities, all the various familiaris, all the skills that he must learn, and all the different runes he must utilize.  The elder dragon had awoke an excitement deep down inside of him that he never knew existed.  She said, "There was a rumor that in ancient times, some even worshiped our race..."  She hugged him and smiled.  "But, I must return to my lair...You have a great deal to absorb and comprehend, young dragon.  Fare thee well, good luck and good skill!" With that, she winked, grinned a toothy grin, and runes gathered around her head.  There was a brilliant flash, and all that was left of her was some gold coins.  He stood there with a quizzical expression on his face when she linked, "Here's some money for you...buy a *real* weapon.  Farewell!"  He blushed and could picture her chuckling. "Farewell, and thank you for all!", he linked.  The young dragon picked up the gold, put it in his pocket, and laid down.  He fell soundly asleep, dreaming no more.  The next morning, he awoke at the crack of dawn, sat up, stretched, and followed his fate exuberantly.

The Collective works of Fynn Vyrrn

A man and a woman
A magic unimagined
A man and a woman
A heart and it's mate
And it BURSTS forth in love and the two become one...
Here are two such who now would be true
And here they are standing together
How can you wonder that now one from two,
This Love will withstand any weather
Rejoice in it, hold to it, never release
Hold hand in hand for in love we find peace.

A Song With A Name I Dare Not Say

Women beautiful and winsome
I see them walking by
So many many lovelies
So I wonder why

I butterfly both here and there
With little feeling on my part
Then you meet a woman
And I swear she stops your heart

Do you know what I mean?
It's not just loveliness you've seen
It's like a magick dart
BAM, a girl takes your heart

Not an eye--but a gesture
Not for sex!!!
It's MUCH more pure

She ties me in knots
It demeans to call "The Hots"
For she rules me like I've never been ruled
How could the eye not be fooled...

What if love fails me?
So I plead with the fates
PLEASE, may these feelings reciprocal be
So mayhaps we two could be mates

For to lose at this is nigh
To break my heart and die
And then you meet a woman
And I swear she stops your heart

And I'm afraid a woman
Has carried off my heart
Yes I fear it happened
A woman has my heart...

...Did you see where she went?

The Wanderings of a Brownie, as seen from the eyes of a Dragon.
By Michael Stormbringer. (Editor's note: Something that was intended for the last DFC, cheers.)

Greetings Citizens of Spur! I am glad you could hear my tale, a tale of daring, mystery, horror, and of love. I shall be your guide into the mind of a rather odd individual of Spur, this being HalfaLoaf Lynwyndo. Who is HalfaLoaf you ask? Well, let us delve into who he is, or isn't. This is, for the most part, all true, as I bear witness to his telling of his tale. I happened to see him one day in Town Square raving about something I found rather amusing, so I asked him to come speak with me. Being of a rather polite individual, he complied and gave me his tale. Sit back, and listen to the words as I try to convey to you, the feeling, he gave to me. It is a strange tale. 

My name is HalfaLoaf, which is roughly translated from my true name, but others not of my race have difficulty saying it, so that is why I am HalfaLoaf. I am a Brownie. My life began back in the land of Leuia, where I was born, where my clan resides, where Brownie was born! The Brownie clan is an ancient one, dating back, well, dating way back there. We are a proud clan, and well, we are the Keepers of the Grail of Milk, a most sacred object of Brownie. Yes, we do have a fondness for brownies, and yes, we do often enjoy milk while eating brownies, but you Spurians have a tough time getting milk, so you may see us questing for milk from time to time. There are but a few Brownies in Spur, such as Walnut, a fierce Sword Cleric. Walnut is brother to Paratwa, and a few years younger, he is not quite up to the level his brother is. Roma is my brother, devoted in his ways, he is like me, a Cleric of the Hand. We are the Enforcers of Brownie, we are the Enforcers of Sa. All Brownies follow Sa, most are Clerics, and all are loyal to Brownie clan. We gain members from time to time, those outside the class or race, those little honorable ones truly see the value of what it is to be a Brownie, become a Brownie, thus Trel is a valued member of Brownie. We welcome those that would embrace Brownie, and will take anyone that wishes it so.

The life of one such as I is a misunderstood one it seems, and I am glad to have this opportunity to show you a day in the life of Brownie. You see, Paratwa is my teacher in the ways of magick and martial arts, being a highly placed member of our Guild and a well respected member of the Pride, regardless of what mantle he wears, he is still my friend (I won't mention a cousin too). Roma closely follows my steps and soon will join me in vanquishing foes for Sa, for the Bowl of Milk, and for Brownie, it shall be a glorious day when we stand together.

::at this point Michael asks HalfaLoaf about goals, interrupting HalfaLoaf's long windedness:::

Well, as the rather fat Dragon rudely interrupts me, I shall answer: We seek nothing from Spur, we seek that which was ours, and shall be ours again, the Grail of Milk, which is currently not in our possession, a matter of great embarrassment, and one of the reasons I am in Spur. To recover the Grail. This Grail is nothing of super powers granted by Sa, nor is it some icon to destroy all of which we know, it is just a really cool milk glass.

::Michael inquires as to the day he saw him at Town Square::

Ahhh, such a fine day, as are all days, are they not? It was a day I had recently finished instruction from Paratwa in the finer arts of pummeling, I must say I do not enjoy the practical demonstrations he performs on me, and I still wince thinking back upon some of them, but then there was the day I slept him in Tanga, but that is another story. Anyway, I had happened upon TS when there was a little one that I give gems to, a Ms. Minerva, well, I usually try to give her gems when I can, and I happened to have one, but there were these two Thugian lummoxes there in front of her, and both grunted at me at the same time. I was perplexed but lithe that I am, I easily sidestepped them and offered her my gem. Well, one of them, a Nunzio I recall, grabbed my finger and broke it! It smarted rather soundly, and I heard him say through the pain, "No touching the Boss." and he grunted again. So I threw the gem at his head, bouncing it off it, Minerva caught it and wave, shrugging an apology to me, I moved off to go heal my finger. That was the end of that, and one day I'll repay their kindness. 

::Michael points out this is the end of the story::
Well folks, at this point, HalfaLoaf seemed to be getting irritated at something and he pointed at something, shrieked, and ran off screaming. It was rather amusing, and something to see for yourself. I have seen HalfaLoaf, and the others he has mentioned, an odd bunch they are. I am a long standing friend to Paratwa and asked him about the Brownies, and he became evasive, and just chuckled. He mentioned something about beating him recently, displaying that Paratwa is still the Shieldmaster or some such, no, a fuzzy shield as he put it. Then Paratwa called to his god and was gone. I hate it when they do that. Many have seen the Brownies, and I know I for one, am in the dark, so I thought to relay this to the rest of Spur. They seem a fun group, carefree and loving, strongly loyal, and somewhat still a great mystery as to why they do things. This concludes my tale, I hope you enjoyed it. I later learned that HalfaLoaf is a younger brother of Paratwa, damn khats, they all seem to have relatives everywhere. Go figure.

Love Most Fantastic
by Marigold Lyrian

We met upon a summer's day
In a wood of mist and brightness
Where under a towering fir he lay
Basked in the morning's lightness.

An elf was he, quite fair at that,
With almond eyes and hair of gold
Upon his head a jaunty hat
Upon his lips a song of old.

He flashed a smile that broke my heart
And bid me stay a while
Love most fantastic had its start
Upon that charming smile.

The moon rose full and still he sang
His voice became my own
O'er the lands our music rang
But the words were all our own.

We danced in a shower of silvery stars
That shimmered from above
And the world I knew seemed very far
From this most fantastic love.

Then eternal joy was ended
Quickly as it had begun
My waking dream of beauty rended
By the cruel, red morning sun.

Lost forever was my dear one
In the shadow of the light
Still, sometimes, I hear his song, and run
To the sound, clear in the night.

Our love was not misbegotten
Though my grief has left me chill;
Love is gone, but not forgotten,
And the memory lingers still.

Music for the heart.   The only way to describe this latest Bardic Championship event.   Congratulations to all the talented competitors at the April 30th recital.  Kudos to our current winners  ---  Gypsie the Bard captured 1st place in Prepared Entries,  with Logeiare and Marigold sharing 2nd place.   In Spur-of-the- Moment, Allwyn won 1st place and Fynn, 2nd.   Well done!   Here are the winning entries.....


First Place Prepared Entries Championship Winner:  Gypsie Zigeuner

Sunday supper is done, but it's still light outside
Honey call up your brother, we'll go for a ride.

The dishes will wait, let's get up and go
We're all goin' down to the end of the road.

The end of the road, that's where lake begins
It once went to someplace but that was back when.

Out there in this valley was the farm of my father
And his grandfather, too, but it's all under water.

This is miles from the place where they halted the flow
That flooded this valley and forced us to go.

The folks of this town needed water to drink
They never asked poppa, "Well, what do YOU think?"

So they gave him some silvers, saying "This price is fair",
We moved to Poor Quarter;  he retired to a chair.

So the home I was born to is a place fishes swim
The money paid poppa paid for burying him.

So we live in a hovel, do millwork all week;
I'm freed from the farm life 'cause they plugged up the creek.

I could go to the old farm, if I had me a raft
Be forty feet above it -- that seems something daft.

So I come here on Sundays with the kids and the wife,
I'll throw rocks at the water that has covered my life.



Second Place Prepared Entries Championship (tie):  Logeiare

Beauty in this Light

Sun blazing on water, which is murky brown.
Wind blowing leaves, the early winter sounds.
Thoughts of her are strong, in this blighted mind,
Giving quiet joy, to a heart which slowly pines.

The endless dome of sky, blue and clear and crisp.
Silent tread of feet, hid in gravel's lisp.
People are around, yet silence is the rule.
And sits a darkened shadow, known only as the fool.

A naming which is apt, for he dances on the edge.
With a heart protected, by a tall and thorny hedge.
He knows the hedge is bright, being of damasked rose
Matching a soul so torn, and wrent with bleeding holes.
 
The bleeding he has need for, without it nothing heals
But still it is a burden for his iron will.
Stoically he bears it, no complaints pass his lips,
For he knows in truth, it has made him what he is.

The golden light of evening holds him fast enthralled.
Beauty in this light comes to touch us all.
With people leaving quietly, their memories fading fast;
He reaches out to touch her, with his empty hollow grasp.

Epic Battle - Marigold

Razor talons,
Eyes of fire
Blood by gallons,
Spilled in ire.

Children screaming,
Mothers weeping
Death's claw, gleaming
As they're sleeping.

Then out of the darkening twilight
There rides a hero brave
To the lair of the beast, as befits a knight
His lady, there to save.

With the flames of hatred raging,
With the drive of evil's heart,
His strength of body never aging
The dragon waits for battle's start.

With the fires of his love burning,
Pushing back cold bleak despair,
The lad draws courage from his yearning
For the kiss of damsel fair.

The fight begins upon the clashing,
Under the blood-washed, crimson sky,
Of sharpened steel and spellfire lashing,
Burning, bright as a banshee's eye.
   
Then a great, triumphant shout,
As the blade drives through a wicked heart
And the dying creature screeches out
A final roar, before he parts.

The maiden stands beside her knight,
They watch the monster fall,
And know that, through the darkest night,
Their love will triumph over all.

Minstrels and Muses

This issue is dedicated to the delightful, enchanting Bards of our realm.  With lyrical voice and hypnotic word, they capture our imaginations and thoughts.  On many an eve, one's soul may be inspired, enraged, or soothed by the flow of those words and the sound of those tunes.

Although yet few in number, their prolific skill grows.  A talented sampling of the Bardic arts follows.  Enjoy!



This first one is my dedication to the Bards of Spur.


The Wanderer
by:  Allandra Shadowfax

A lonely minstrel wanders 
On a road both far and long,
Seeking eager listeners
For his charismatic song.

The wind sighs in his hearing, 
The birds rest close by bough;
By chance he finds a clearing,
At twilight's evening glow.

The stars will bear him witness,
The crescent,  bend its ear;
For not a soul can find this
Pure glade of song so clear.

The minstrel strums his lute;
To Wind, he spins his tale,
Its melody lilts true ---
Beside it, moonbeams pale.

A light gleams through the leafblades,
A second, a third, and soon,
More flickers fill the green glade
As men flock to hear his tune.

The minstrel smiles so proudly,
His words float on the wind;
He muses, now more loudly,
Of hearth, and stone, and kin.

For now his stage is open,
The rhyme is from his heart;
He will not be forgotten,
This Bard of ancient art...


I Love the Place But You More 
by:  Fynn Vyrrn

Oh, there's a place where I wish I'd return,
By the cliffs, by the sea, by the steep stony burn.
Where I lived as a youth,
And to tell you the truth,
I miss every stone, tree, and fern.

Oh, the green of the hills of that place,
Just the thought of it brings a smile to my face.
Oh how I long for it, miss it so sore,
But I love you even more.

It's a place that rests always soft on my mind.
Still I wander and hope yet a better to find.
I've seen sunsets of fire,
And trees that were higher,
Many beautiful sight of that kind.

But oh, the green of the hills of that place
Just the thought of it brings a smile to my face.
Oh, how I long for it, miss is so sore,
But I love you even more.

But everything pales compared to your hair,
Your eyes and your touch are still more fair
And your kiss and your smile
And your voice for awhile
Is all for which I care.

Oh, the green of your eyes.  Oh, your grace!
Just the thought of you brings a smile to my face.
Oh, how I long for you, miss you so sore.
Every day I love you more.

Oh to shelter you there in my place,
By the cliffs, by the sea, face to face


The Death Song of Fynn
by:  Fynn Vyrrn

I lay upon the muddy field
Among the weapons I once wielded
They lay where we did fall,
Cast like a contorted cloth rag doll.

I stare with deadening eyes up to the gibbering moon,
Locked in cursed black body bound rictus of ruin,
I lay cursing --- but silently with nary a breath,
Held tight in the fist of death.
....OOOHHhhhhhhh
Mockery, such mockery, by body hacked.
My soul wanders wretched, my body lays wracked,
Oh, mockery, body so carelessly laid waste.
Looking down at my pale white face so like paste.

Oh gods, PLEASE, somebody close my eyes.
Somebody close my eyes.

Have I not died many times before?
Why now this death affects me more?
I see me cold and lifeless -- bled.
And I can't get it out of my head.

See the marks of desperate strife?
See the red wet pool of my life?
See how it gleams 'neath the gibbering moon,
See my dulling eyes?  Pray thee, a boon!   

Oh gods, please, SOMEBODY close my eyes.
Somebody close my eyes.

I lay forlorn in disdignified mort,
So easy to live again of a sort,
A level?  some coin?..
                ...my hope.   That's the toll.
The worm still eats at my soul.

Have you seen the dull flat sheen on eyes,
In the heart of a horrified face when one dies?

Oh, gods, please ANYONE, close my eyes.
PLEASE,  somebody close my eyes.


Again and Again
By:  Fynn Vyrrn

To fight and win and fight and die
And then to rise from where you lie
And do it again
And again
And again
You ready a weapon to do it again.

You wish for a moment of shady rest
Then the Shade takes a thirty point slice of your chest
And does it again
And again
And again
You look for a healer to stifle the pain.

But sadly, she greets you with tears in her eyes.
An elf with a question, but no reasons why.
You try to help with each others' pain...
But the tears come again
And again
And again
You try but the pain comes again.

Championship Bardic Recital

This month's (March) First Place Championship was captured by the prolific and talented Monticath Allimar.   Congratulations are also in order to Sordum Corinth for Second Place.   As usual, the competition was fierce and kudos to all participants.  Here are the winning poems.

First Place Prepared Entries Champion --  Monticath Allimar

I walk through the streets and learn,
As I watch, my soul begins to yearn for peace.
Everywhere is hatred and strife,
Everyone vies to take another's life.
My life, my purpose, is aimed towards peace
But all around me the violence will never cease.
Has my path been wrong, my vision is unclear,
As I watch destruction take all I hold dear.

Should I go forth and take the battle to them?
To those who destroy, must I destroy them?
Can peace only come through force?
Must I become what I hate?
That is the crux of my debate.

My future is before me,
And the paths diverge;
Two ways before me,
May my choice be right.
I pray to Sa for guidance
And pray He points me towards the light.


Second Place Prepared Entries Champion -- Sordum Corinth

'Lost Soul Song'

All across the white sand plain
The moon would always wax and wane.
The group was found, all but one;
They went back through the burning sun.
When they were but a dot on the horizon,
She stepped out, like a black storm rising.
Her eyes glowed, as she followed the tracks;
The others thought they had killed her,
But she would soon be back.

Her soul was as cold as the winter snow,
Her heart was black,  black as coal;
The tracks led back to a city called the Spur,
A city that certainly wasn't ready for her.
Wherever she went, the vultures followed;
The city of light was about to be swallowed.

Her heart pounded as she entered the town,
The ones who had hurt her were soon to be found.
She arrived at a square with a twenty foot gate;
She decided, 'it is here I shall wait'.
The ones who had committed the deed
Were rushing to her with incredible speed.

When they arrived, there lay on the ground
Hundreds of bodies that would never again make a sound.
The leader stepped up and begged in a voice that was hoarse,
But the cold-hearted one would feel no remorse.
When the day finally dawned, she returned to the sand,
The souls of those who had hurt her, long gone from the land.

The story continues, that on a cold winter night,
That others have seen her, and ran in fright;
And rumor has it, when the light is all gone,
She can be heard singing her lost soul song...   


Events around Town

Recently, one of Spur's citizens received a public hearing by a duly-appointed Justice in Town Square.  Based on the evidence and statements of witnesses, a charge of murder was upheld.  The invoked punishment included forfeiture of the citizen's current existence and transformation to another race.     Perhaps stunned by the verdict, this citizen added to the drama by suddenly fleeing the scene, earning the name of Fugitive.   Needless to say, with a price now on his head, this citizen led pursuers on a wild chase throughout town and beyond, being spotted in numerous Spurian locales prior to ultimate capture.  The entire proceedings evoked heated debate among observers about the concepts of justice, fairness, and impartiality, but ultimately, Justice prevailed and held firm.



On a Lighter Note

Alas, having received no new word on the whereabouts of my Oog-ra romantics,
I'm forced to conclude they have vanished to regions beyond our purview.  Perhaps traveling bards might spread the news of mysterious kissing rituals in far-distant lands beyond our borders.  Keep your ears open and make sure to drop me a scroll with the highlights if you come across such tales on your journey.

A brief lesson in stupidity
by Konichiwa Arigato

     Hello there.  I am Konichiwa.  You may or may not know me.  If the latter, it's your loss, I assure you.  However, if you're one of those unfortunate individuals, then allow me to present myself.  As I said before, I am Konichiwa.  Konichiwa Arigato, to be exact.  And I am a thief of some small repute.  And, by the way, if you're wondering about the name; don't ask.  You'd probably never get the same answer twice.  Anyhow, back to business.  For the further enlightenment of you who do not know me or, indeed, haven't even heard of me; let me tell you a little about myself.  I've already mentioned that I'm a thief.  And perhaps you few precious individuals with any sense have recognized, despite my affected and arrogant tone, that we are alike in that regard.  For the rest of you, let me say this.  I am no one's fool.  Quite the opposite in fact.  I am fully and inherently capable of putting many an Usil scholar to shame.  Not that this is necessarily the greatest of feats in itself, but I believe I have expressed the point adequately.  Now while there have always been, and must always be, a certain number of those who are intellectually inferior to your average Thugian; I find that their numbers have greatly increased in a very short amount of time. I don't mind having a steady supply on hand; if everyone were as smart as I am, I'd nearly be out of a job.  But as there are currently more of them than I am able to exploit, I am of the opinion that something should be done to get rid of the unwanted surplus.   Sadly, with death on sabbatical, genocide is not the answer.  What we are left with, is education.  To that end, I am writing this.  It is my hope that when faced with the realizations I've come to, those others in Spur not totally devoid of common sense will rally to the cause.  To wit, a Thug/Oog-ra monopoly on stupidity.  So, without further ado, I provide you with this recounting of a portion of my life for your amusement... And hopefully, enlightenment. 

      "It all began late one Spurian evening.  I'd been having the worst of days and was in no particularly great mood.  Unbeknownst to me, that was about to change rather drastically in a very short amount of time.  Thinking to insure that the day was not a total waste, I made my way to Set temple.  As is my wont, I often go there for practice in the various thiefly arts.  As luck would have it, I encountered Syeth there.  Greetings, compliments, and other pleasantries were exchanged, and we began our practice.  As normal, the conversation intersected numerous topics on several different levels.  We exchanged stories and various articles of local rumor, though doubtless nothing Panthera hadn't heard a week before.  After some time had passed, we noticed the entrance of a young dragon.  As I recall, his name was rather odd.  Qp something or other.. Likely the odd name was intended to ward against quick retaliation for any trouble he might cause.  To make it easier on myself during the telling of this tale, I will give him a new name.  In honor of my acute love of irony and in recognition of this little dragon's nature, I will name him Quip.  Syeth and I gave him a quick once-over--sizing him up, as it were.  Dragons have been known, occasionally, to make visits to our temple in the past.  But seeing that he wore nothing and carried nothing, it was decided by mutual unspoken agreement to let him be.  It was then that he spoke and addressed the two of us.  He informed us that he had lost his way and had mistakenly journeyed to Spur all the way from the far distant training grounds.  Now even knowing as little of that place of legend as one of my vocation ever does, I still found it rather difficult to believe that one who follows no god could "accidentally" journey all the way to Spur.  So difficult, in fact, that I failed utterly in my attempts to give credit to his plight and was faced with the near-impossible task of not laughing out loud.  With some considerable effort, I managed to contain myself and consulted Syeth in whispers.  In moments I learned he'd met my very same failure.  Further consultation was interrupted by a second declaration from little Quip.  As it happened, he was in dire need of a weapon and had only 3000 silver with which to make the purchase.  Quip then inquired if perhaps Syeth or myself could provide him with something for a portion of his amassed wealth.  Upon the realization of the implications of what little Quip had said, I found myself in a familiar position.  That being: Again I was taken with the uncontrollable urge to fall to the ground in fits of merriment until such time as I heaved my last.  Yet again, somehow, I resisted the impulse.  Following another quick consult with Syeth, it was decided to gift our new friend with a quick crash-course in Spurian economics.  Ten seconds and 3000 silver later, our young patron began to contemplate the sudden spring in his step.  Taking pity on our small friend, Syeth then gifted him further with a fine specimen of a battle-axe.  Promising to sing praises of our generosity to all those who would listen, Quip left.  Immediately thereafter, Syeth fell victim to the very impulses we'd been fighting all along and nearly threw himself at the stonework amidst howls of laughter.  When he informed me of the relative condition of the axe he'd parted with, I felt compelled to join him.  After we'd composed ourselves and begun our practice session anew, to our delight, Quip returned!  Quip's manners, however, had not returned with him.  Brandishing the newly purchased axe that was intended to be our downfall, he shouted things at us as would surely incite the wrath of any TOS gods who heard them.  Fortunately for little Quip, only Syeth and myself were present.  I was then further shocked when my timely warning about such things was repaid with enthusiastic, if sophomoric, slurs on my moral character.  Though my innocent ears burned with the shame of hearing such utterances and my senses reeled at the implications of that which I had been accused, I somehow managed a reply.  Quip and I bantered back and forth in that manner for the better part of five minutes.  I won't bore you with the details of that exchange, but those of you who know much about me can probably guess at the results.  If you've any interest, perhaps you can ask Syeth about the little tete-a-tete.  For me, the vile things I heard are just too awful to repeat.  Er.. Pardon me, my halo seems to have suddenly acquired a new bit of tarnish that needs tending to... There.. Now, where was I? Ah yes.. Having tired of my conversation, Quip proceeded to threaten our lives with that most feared of weapons, the battle-axe.  On hearing me express my concern to Sy that peacebond was an entire step away, (quaking in my mail the entire time, mind you) Quip the mighty fell upon us both with all his horrible rage.  After his third nap, (falling upon people in all your horrible rage is tiring work you know) he dealt his final (only) blow to poor Syeth.  Had it not been for my timely aid with a tiny scrap of parchment and some string, my poor comrade would surely have perished.  (Probably of embarrassment.)  It was at that moment, out of desperation and fearing for our lives, Syeth and I decided to relieve Quip the ungrateful of the axe Sy had so thoughtfully allowed him to buy.  Time after time the axe went clattering to the floor, but each time it did, we were so overcome by fear that we couldn't bring ourselves to pick it up lest Quip be angered.   Besides, that would be stealing, which we all know is WRONG...  Finally after long hours of hard battle through which Syeth and I barely managed to survive, Quip had a change of heart.  In his great benevolence he deigned to warn us of an impending meeting between us and his brother.  You can imagine our despair when we discovered his brother was even more powerful than he.  He'd probably been in training grounds for WEEKS; surely we didn't stand a chance!  It was then that the AOL gods themselves saw our plight and took pity on us by casting all of Spur into limbo.  When the realm was released hours later, Syeth and I breathed our sighs of relief.  Thus saved, we continue in our meager existence..."

     Before I continue I would like to ask that you excuse some of the sarcasm in the later half of the story.  I tend to overdo it a bit every now and then.  Having said that, I would like to point out that this was not even the end of the story.  I became aware a few days later that Quip had waylaid another thief (with a battle-axe) for no apparent reason.  By testimony of that same thief I believe he was last seen weaponless in the fairgrounds, running from a rogue.  If any of you should happen to run across him there, please give him my regards.  Now, I realize that not all of the idiots in Spur are THIS bad.  But nonetheless, people like this are out there.  These are the same people who get you killed suicide hunting in the wretch cave or fly hunting with Yelicans.  You already know killing them isn't the answer, (especially if they're dying repeatedly on their own) but SOMETHING needs to be done.  The only other thing that makes sense is to train them.  (Much like you would a new familiar) Distasteful as it may be to some, taking these individuals in hand and showing them how to behave is really the only way to get anything done.  Perhaps I'm just lucky in this regard, but I see a lot fewer idiots who are khats than I generally do for other races.  Considering how many khats there are in Spur, that's saying something.  I've got to believe the Pride and its sponsorship practices have something to do with it.  Especially in light of my guild's recent education campaign resulting in a drastic reduction in the number of feral thieves.  Conversely, a good number of the ferals and idiots I run into are Arachnians or Monitanians.  Long established members of those races, of course, do not fall into that category.  But the fact remains, they've got more than their fair share.  I would encourage the established Spurians to 'take care of your own'.  Forcefully if necessary.  I've seen it happen before both as a San and as a thief.  And I must say, I enjoyed the show.  But think of it this way.  Best case scenario, you end up with a staunch ally who may be powerful enough to help you out some day.  Worst case, you have fun toying around with them until they finally get fed up and leave Spur indefinitely.  Of course, if they actually get away you have to let them go.. Wouldn't want to harass anyone.. But they'll probably come back seeking revenge, so you'll get to play with them some more later on and it won't really matter anyway.

May your hunting go well and your pockets be ever full..... Until I get there.

The first ever Circle of Honor sponsors,
The High Spurian Archery Competition!
Date: Sunday, June the 8th 
Time: 4 PM eastern
Location: The gate to the Spurian park(Across from the governors mansion)

 The archery contest is open to all who feel they have the skill at archery, and the guts to prove it!

     It is being sponsored by the Circle Of Honor who all proceeds will be going to, they will also be providing the prizes. Each competitor will be provided with a bow and a number of arrows needed to finish the event. These bows will be identical so that there is no advantages. Each round all of the competitors will have three shots with which one must hit the target......The targets will become harder to hit as the rounds go bye until we have a champion! The final three to four people will get special prizes, and everyone else gets to keep the bows and arrows. There will numerous other things along with the archery competition, including hopefully food and drink.....And a possible appearance by one of the spurs must renown peddlers. I encourage everyone to make it and bring a small amount of money because there will be an entry fee.(Bring 4K and you should be fine) . 

Thanks to the Circle of Honor and all of you!, 
See you all there!

There was a pop up Peddle in Spur recently hosted by Simeonius Gileaden, I was able to go to one of them, as I hear rumors of a few others, but this is what was sold and for how much, just so you all have an idea on what things like these can go for. -M

Simeonius says, "Next herb, minimum 25K"
Simeonius says, "Sold for 80K to Potcrahina" Ivy Snippet-perception herb

Simeonius just dropped a small aqua maple leaf. Simeonius says, "I believe that this one makes you  brighter/wise"
Simeonius says, "Next herb, minimum 50K"Simeonius says, "160 from Tenser going once""SOLD"

Simeonius just dropped a yew branch. Simeonius says, "Minimum bid 25K"Simeonius says, "You become more popular"(charisma)Simeonius says, "75K to Suraklin once"

Spur's Top 5 List(last month)
by Sordum Corinth

I want to welcome you all to this months top 5's!!!! With the departure of Milanden from the land I have taken over the top 5 lists for the DFC. So you fully understand, the topics where chosen by myself and everyone had two weeks to cast there votes. Each person could only vote once, and this month we had over 50 people cast there votes!!!! Many more people than those you see were voted for, but of the categories here are the top 5 for each.

Spurs five best gladiators.
1.Gristle 
2.Reywind
3.Marakos
4.Methos
5. Sensuous and Sordum tie.
-Gristle and his tank armor have made him truly one of the toughest opponents in the games, not to mention his accidental use of Storm spells ::snicker:: Close behind was the flying Reywind and his spheres, flying and big magic spells. Next came the best glower around, Marakos, Capable of giving anyone one heck of a headache.

Spurs most adorable.
1.Minerva
2.ChibiChibi
3.Ophilia
4.Pepperi
5.Gemmer
-Minnie the princess of the spur, you cant get much more adorable then her. And Sneaking on the list of all Secians is Chibi the Flerian and her trademark line Kisu! All the Secians are so adorable its almost to hard to judge. :)

Most used hunting ground.
1.Haunted house
2.Wretch cave
3.Rouge field
4.Temple of Set
5.Yelican forest
-The skeleton closets in the haunted house still are one of the most used areas, combine that with the rest of the house and it is the most used by far. The Wretch cave being second with only six rooms, this shows the place is really in need of expansion, perhaps that cave in the southern end.......And the temple of Set? I don't really want to know who thinks this is a hunting ground, but if hunting thieves is yer thing, that's the place to go.

Least used locations.
1.Tilgen's office
2.Tanga
3.Meetpoint
4.Sewers
5.Sailors guild/Sordum's office
-Well it would seem the senile side of all you showed up when you voted the least seen elder and his office into the top least used location. Many people were asking if his office has ever been used at all. And how my office in the sailor guild ever got on here......Its used by every scriptor in the land:)

Most creative piece of armor
1.ChibiChibi's bunny ear helmet
2.Michael's Rotund belly and ruby plate corset
3.Gristle's Tan Morbuis door
4.Sordum's glittering sun mail
5.Vagn's ebony black-mail (Catch the Black-male pun there.)
-Chibi and the bunny ears, Michael's Corset, and Gristle's door. Need I say more?

Best whiner
1.Halfaloaf
2.Paratwa
3.Fearagoh
4.HeCat
5.Imposter and Redrose tie.
-Truly Halfaloaf earned this highly coveted award of top whiner, we worked for weeks to beat out Fear and Paratwa. Imposter the ex-governor is still whining about wanting her mansion back, and Redrose is whining about everything.

 I hope you all enjoyed this, and if you didn't vote this time get yer vote in for next month!!!! The categories will be posted soon so look for them in te DFC folder. Thanks so much to everyone who voted!
Sordum Corinth

Spur's Top 5 List(current)
Welcome everyone to this months top 5's, im your host Sordum Corinth here making yer voting that much more fun. This month we had lots of great topics that everyone got really into.....I hear people have been paying people to cast votes for them ::shudder:: The rules are simple, you send one vote for each topic to me (SN Hashut) and I tally up yer votes, the top 5 most voted for people get there names in the DFC plus all the fame and fortune that comes with being a top 5 winner :) If you feel left out cause you didn't vote, you should.....But you can help yourself by voting next month!!!! Well without further ado, here are this months winners!

Top 5 best couples
1.Zaargo and Cedralaero(spelling?)
2.Vagn and Mellisa
3.Orchist and Panthera
4.Worf and Sensuous
5.Kharmen and Katylia
 The race for top couple was very close, with each of the couples within a vote or two of each other. All of them plus many more are great couples in the spur, picking a winner would be tough to do out of all of the possibilities.

Top 5 best gladiators of the month
1.Jinko
2.Paratwa
3.Methos
4. 2nd flying squirrel?
5.Sensuous
 Jinko the Hithual has taken the top spot from Gristle, who is noticeably absent from the top 5 list. Jinko and his lay hands, big sword, and big spells make a lethal combo, and he is most definitely someone to stay away from in the games. After the changes, Martial Arts power has grown and Paratwa has risen to the second spot on the list with his flying kicks. And this month the Second flying Squirrel barely beat out Sensuous and a lot of other for that number for 4 spot......Seems Sensuous should take lessons from the squirrel. ::gulp::

Top 5 biggest bullies!
1.Welsey
2.Karnage
3.Rcv
4.Baejh
5.Warcool
Welsey worked harder than anyone to win this award, and as luck might have it he somehow pulled the first place finish in biggest bully, something we all know he will be over joyed about. Karnage snuck up there, even though he is showing a sweeter side lately. And Warcool, although not seen at all lately still has his presence felt in the biggest bullies.

Best Light Source
1. Minerva's coral castle
2.Verbenas glowing mushroom
3.Tisha's funky ol' Potina doll
4. Kyrsten's blue moon beam
5.Balinor's blood stained orb

Top 5 most pathetic
1.Redrose
2.Chelestrea
3.Wesley
4.Ferals
5.Bards
Redrose winning top most pathetic, I would swear just yesterday Redrose was a Monitanian....But now she is a Secian ::shudder:: Alarians are everywhere! Chelestrea the Psycian bard pulled a close second followed by the biggest bully. Ferals should  normally be number one on this list, but I guess this month there were things worse.....

Top 5 Most wanted new commands
1.Stick out tongue at
2.Backstab
3.Raise hand
4.Poke
5.Twitch

That's it for this months top 5's.....I encourage you all to vote for next months which will be appearing in a DFC folder near you.

Interview about the games from this months top gladiator Jinko!

Sordum says, "Alright, I would like to congratulate you Jinko on being gladiator of the month!"

Jinko says, "Why thank you much! I'm both pleased an shocked..."

Sordum grins.

Sordum says, "How do you think the changes have affected you getting this award?"

Jinko says, "Not much...Though our class was weakened some, I've been able to work around it..."

Jinko says, "Exploit me strengths...the few that are left..."

Sordum nods.

Sordum says, "Is there anyone out there you try and stay away from in the games?"

Sordum says, "Someone who always gets you?"

Jinko says, "High fighters do bad damage to me...No one in particular..."

Sordum nods.

Jinko says, "Mages aren't that much of a problem anymore..."

Sordum grumbles.

Jinko says, "I just thank SA Rebel and TigerClaw don't participate..."

Jinko grins.

Sordum chuckles.

Sordum says, "Is there any tactics you use that seem to work really well, wether in the SGA or in the gladiator games?"

Jinko says, "SGA is all teamwork..."

Jinko says, "Our team does good, because we are all good..."

Sordum nods.

Jinko says, "Gladiator games...It depends what kind of team I have..."

Jinko says, "It is REAL hard to kill a cleric of my caliber, just for the healing aspect..."

Sordum nods up and down.

Jinko says, "It takes one of Methos' webs ta get me..."

Jinko says, "I like to storm lately..."

Sordum nods.

Jinko says, "It's fun...but not real effective..."

Jinko says, "Basically, I cast a few spells..."

Jinko says, "Then swing a few swings..."

Sordum nods.

Jinko says, "Y'know...bash the Mages, fry the fighters..."

Jinko says, "And laugh at the foresters's..."

Sordum grins.

Jinko winks.

Jinko says, "Just kidding...."

Jinko smiles.

Sordum says, "What do you think about your race as a whole in the games?"

Jinko says, "My race, for a while, was very underrated..."

Jinko says, "We hef good DR's and high hit points..."

Sordum nods.

Jinko says, "Though you don't see many Hithuals in the games..."

Jinko says, "We are always a valuable asset..."

Jinko says, "Funny how we can't be Mages, yet there are those of us who do great magick work..."

Sordum nods up and down.

Sordum says, "Are the any types of games you would like to see held in the future, or any ideas for the games to make them better?"

Jinko says, "I liked the Elder Drag a lot...It was real fun..."

Sordum chuckles.

Jinko says, "It wasn't who could kill who, it was who could strategize the best..."

Jinko says, "The fact I had a map I made didn't hurt any..."

Jinko winks.

Sordum pinches Jinko.

Jinko grins.

Jinko says, "I like FFA's just for the storm aspect..."

Jinko says, "Ever see that scroll fer two minutes?"

Jinko winks.

Sordum grins.

Sordum says, "I don't want to"

Sordum winks.

Jinko smiles.

Sordum says, "is there anything you are going to try and do in the future to become an even better gladiator?"

Jinko says, "There's not much more I can do..."

Jinko says, "As a Sword Cleric...I've pretty much maxed out..."

Jinko says, "Sure, my spell delays will go down a little..."

Sordum nods.

Jinko says, "But after level 20 in sharps, Sword Clerics become Mages with weak spells..."

Jinko says, "I'd like to see that change..."

Sordum nods.

Jinko says, " ::hint for programmers:: We need something better...Maybe level 30 max?"

Jinko whistles.

Sordum grins.

Jinko says, "Or forgin would be nice..."

Jinko winks.

===========================================================================
Well everyone, here's one of the first of a few interviews with some of the more prominent Bards of the Spur, these shall start with this issue. This first one is with a Lady and a truly magickal person, alluring the citizens of Spur with a musically flowing voice, trapping us in our seats until she finishes speaking. I speak none other than of Allandra, the fair maiden of famed Bardic Recitals, fashion model of Rehas.
We join in already in progress, let's take a peek....

Michael says, "Ok, got my auto scribe going"

Allandra chuckles.

Michael says, "I can afford them on my wages now."

Michael winks.

Allandra says, "Yes, Editors have it made."

Allandra winks.

Allandra chuckles.

Michael says, "Well, I don't think I've ever done this sort of thing..hope you have a few."

Michael smiles fiendishly.

Allandra blanches.

Allandra says, "I've never been interviewed, either.  Just did a couple on
others."

Michael says, "With good cause..let's see..let me shut off my link now."

Allandra smiles sweetly.

Michael says, "Ahh, all set..gee, I don't wanna sound like a broken record either, but I may."

Allandra smiles.

Allandra says, "As you wish."

Allandra says, "I'm usually verbose, but I'll probably get tongue tied, anticipating your questions."

Allandra chuckles.

(Allandra tries to compose herself, placing her hands calmly folded in her
lap.)

Michael says, "hmmm, let's see..firstly, for the records, I am here with Allandra Shadowfax, a lover of the fine arts and master healer. I hear you are now a rezzer, congratulations. I have not had the chance to say such."

Allandra says, "Thank you, Michael.  I'm ecstatic to be able to return the favor to so many who have helped save my life."

Allandra smiles.

You remove your plaid cloth bagpipes.

Michael says, "I remember when you came to Spur so long ago, introduced by a friend, I noticed you quickly showed your interest in the bardic lifestyles. Care to disclose to those interested, what drives you to do so much for the Craft? I refer to perhaps influences,"

Allandra smiles.

Michael says, "passions, and do you play instruments?"

Michael raises an eyebrow to Allandra.

Michael says, "And what lead you to chose the path of a healer, I'm sure it was a difficult choice, perhaps, between that and becoming a Bard?"

Allandra says, "Well, first, I must again extend my gratitude to Skratchnar, who tapped my interest in starting the Bardic Recitals and acted as
benefactor.  "

Allandra says, "I have an affinity for the sound of lyrics;  have written poetry since I was knee-high."

Allandra smiles.

Michael beams.

Allandra says, "Truly, the passion comes from the heart, and the soul.  Yes,
I was very torn in my choice of life's work."

Allandra says, "To my eternal delight, I have been able to combine both in This world of ours."

Allandra smiles.

Michael says, "Well, I for one, will give you my thanks, as you have been one to encourage my humble offerings..and Spur would never know. I can thank you for poking me along in my ways. You are certainly a gift I recognize, weather the rest see it or not, I do, and "

Michael says, "applaud your efforts and hard work for all you have done."

Allandra says, "My passion is further driven by the exceptional bardic talent I have had the privilege of witnessing in Spur."

Allandra smiles warmly at Michael.

Michael whines.

Michael says, "Yer in the spotlight, not me."

Michael snickers.

Allandra says, "Your lyrical gifts are some of the talent of which I speak,
Michael."

Allandra smiles.

Michael coughs.

Michael blushes.

Michael says, "Damn, ya did it to me again."

Michael mumbles something beneath his breath.

Allandra says, "What did I do?"

Allandra blinks.

(Michael ponders his next question, waiting for the blush to pass.)

Michael grins.

Allandra says, "I'm sorry.........in response to your question about instruments, I do play the harp a little. "

Allandra smiles.

Allandra says, "The lilting poignant sound of its bittersweet strings pulls at my heart and draws poetry from my soul."

Allandra smiles.

Michael says, "Hmmmm, What plans do you have for the near future? Perhaps you could fill the readers in on something juicy...something to drool over, as your next project?"

Michael giggles.

Allandra blushes.

Michael says, "Ha, gotcha!"

Allandra says, "Hmmm........."

(Allandra mumbles something about sneaky editors under her breath.)

Michael smiles wickedly.

Allandra grins.

Allandra says, "Well, I do hope to enhance the bardic offerings in Spur, and support the Bards in their development in any way I can."

Michael says, "Especially now, that they are without a guild."

Michael sighs softly.

Allandra says, "Well, they have some wonderful ideas for advancing their abilities and sharing their talents with the citizens of Spur."

Michael says, "Times are hard, for the Bards, what do you think of the Governor's choice to remove their Guild from Spur?"

Allandra says, "I mean, for one, imagine how delightful 'twould be to have a talented minstrel at your wedding ceremony......or feast."

Allandra smiles.

Michael says, "I would not argue that point."

Michael says, "It is hard to remain neutral on something that is so
passionate to one, is it not?"

Allandra says, "Hmmm........I firmly believe that the Governor's action is a decidedly temporary one.  Bards are an integral and wonderful part of our land.  They feed the spirit."

Michael nods.

Michael grins.

Allandra says, "Yes, indeed it is.  The word is often mightier than the
blade."

Allandra smiles.

Michael says, "Would you have words for those affected?"

Allandra says, "Why, yes.........remain true to your craft, and listen to your heart.  The soul of a Bard makes the bard, and nothing can impede that."

Michael beams.

Michael nods up and down.

Allandra smiles.

Michael says, "Well said."

Allandra says, "And remember that many here adore the arts, support the arts, and crave the arts.  Your bardic gifts are not, and will not, be in vain."

Allandra smiles.

Michael says, "Now, shall I become somewhat personal for those lucky guys out there dying to know...do you hold a flame? No need to answer if you do not wish it."

Allandra blushes.

Allandra smiles.

(Michael pokes Allandra in the ribs, encouragingly.)

Allandra says, "Well..........yes, I do have a passion for someone."

Allandra blushes.

Michael says, "I can live with that, no need to put em on the spotlight, after all, it's yer turn."

Michael teases Allandra.

Michael winks.

Michael says, "I'm sure it'll pop a few dreams however."

Allandra says, "A talented and artistic craftsman......."

Allandra smiles.

Michael nods up and down.

Allandra says, "Oh?"

Allandra blinks.

Michael grins.

Michael nods.

Allandra blushes.

(Michael chalks up number two.)

Allandra tickles Michael.

Michael snickers.

(Allandra mumbles about crafty and conniving editors. )

Allandra laughs.

Michael whistles.

Allandra says, "You most certainly ask some difficult and probing questions."

Allandra coughs.

Allandra grins.

Michael says, "Hmmmm, it's my job. I'm blunt like that. Must be my Dragon blood."

Michael grins.

Michael ducks.

Allandra says, "I'd like to add something if I may....... "

Allandra tickles Michael.

Michael says, "Surely"

Allandra chuckles.

Michael says, "I'm not one fer formalities, spit it out."

Allandra says, "Yes, only that it's been thoroughly gratifying for me to discover how the poetic and musical arts dissolve boundaries between people."

Michael says, "Good point, and very true. If only for the moment."

Allandra says, "Bards, Psycians, dragons, humans, Leuians, drag-als, and more, have come together in peaceable company to share words and song, delighting in each other's talent."

Allandra smiles.

Michael says, "Back, sorry bout that"

Allandra smiles.

Michael says, "another polite one"

Michael grins.

Allandra grins.

Michael coughs.

Michael says, "I'm sorry bout that.."

Michael says, "I've totally lost my train of thought as well"

Michael mutters something beneath his breath.

Allandra says, "Oh, I would be remiss if I didn't thank Rehas for all his tremendous support, help with the recitals, and marvelously crafted designer ensembles."

Allandra grins.

Michael says, "I was about thru with you as well..ah, Rehas, I like him..he
liked my poems.."

Michael winks.

Allandra blushes.

Michael says, "I have to take him up on his brewing abilities or imports he claims..it's hard to find a good draft around here."

Michael says, "So we'll have ta see bout that."

Michael winks.

You stand up.

Allandra says, "Yes, he has an excellent ear poetry.  And wonderful imports,
yes."

Allandra grins.

Michael says, "I thank you for you time, This has been most fun."

Michael snickers.

Allandra says, "Oops,,, ear for poetry, I should say."
chuck

Michael chuckles.

Michael says, "Shall we be on our way then?"

Michael grins.

Allandra says, "Thank you for taking the time, Michael.  It's indeed an
honor to be interviewed by a fellow bard of the heart."

Allandra smiles.

Michael beams to Allandra.

Allandra stands up.

Michael hugs Allandra.

Michael says, "Most kind."

Allandra hugs Michael.

Allandra grins.
grin

Michael grins.

Michael says, "let us be off, where would you like to go?"

Allandra says, "That was fun.  Except of course, for a couple of those
....err.....tough questions."

Allandra coughs.

Allandra chuckles.

(Michael puts on a cap, "Michael's Escort Service.")

Allandra laughs.

Michael grins.

The red glass scythe is now your ready weapon.

Michael says, "Gotta be the tough guy now."

Michael coughs.

Allandra says, "I love that scythe.  It's neat."

Michael grunts.

Allandra smiles.

Michael says, "It's Soros' little toy."

Michael snickers.

Allandra readies a yellowing scroll.

Allandra waves her yellowing scroll.

Michael blinks.

Michael ducks.

Allandra says, "This'll keep 'em at bay."

(Allandra brandishes her scroll like a gleaming scimitar.)

Allandra grins.

Michael laughs.

Michael says, "paper cut!"

Allandra nods.

Michael whimpers.

You open the closed giant white wood double-doors.

Michael says, "let's go!"

Michael howls.

Allandra smiles.

So we come to a close, so all you wondering guys out there, she's taken.. I know of a few hopes and dreams will be bruised learning This, but we gain a window into the mind of a wonder. Until next time Spur.

===========================================================================
A Strange Resident of Spur, by Kraggon Rockhard

What I have to tell may not be important. Or it may be relate to a danger looming off the horizon. Several of us now think the old elf somehow hints at that which has threatened Spur for centuries. I write this to make concerned citizens aware of the situation. However, I won't use the old one's name. Not matter who or what he is, I would feel bad if he suffered rude attacks. 

I first saw the old elf in the bard guild. Monilea the Psycian had announced that she was going to tell the story of the Summoning of Dazrada Soros. I went, hoping that the story might have bits of Hithual history in it as well. I saw him sitting to the side, propped weakly against the wall. He was dirty and unkempt, a state in which I had never seen a Usil. He bore the mark of Taath. As folk milled about, he talked with Monilea, asking her if her tale was a history or fiction, and implying that he knew much about Spur 200 years in the past.

Monilea began her tale, and he sat back against the wall with his eyes closed, as if he were seeing the events with an inner vision or memory. As she spoke, he repeatedly fingered something hanging from his neck. Monilea told of a Great Fire in which all the high priests of Spur, including Aremaia Starling of Rinanni and Dazrada Soros of Taath, had disappeared. Aremaia returned to Spur after nearly 100 years, but not Dazrada the Psycian. The Master Assassin Esteban Lovecraft-Dubois, a Muat, yearned to bring Dazrada back as well. In Old Spur, there was a San, Hex ChunChan, who was a Dhuvghal, a recursive. Recursives were ones, whose spirits were immortal. Their bodies could be destroyed, but they would return in a new form years later. These Dhuvghal, according to Monilea's scrolls, are evil and serve a mysterious master.

Hex had a Usil, Strangeangel Sondemiroir, killed with a terrible weapon called a Fang of Rhangkhorre. Through this person's death, Hex gained control over several magickal amulets. Esteban learned of This, and killed Hex in exchange for the spent fragment of the Fang. Hex's head soon stood in the Temple of Taath, and Esteban used to shard to summon his old priest, Dazrada.

The old elf said many strange things during and after the tale-telling. Strangeangel stole the amulets. Everyone, including himself, wanted to see Hex destroyed, and the old elf smiled at the thought of Hex's head on the Taathian altar. The one who called himself Soros in Old Spur was an impostor of Dazrada Soros, who was found dead in the Temple after his summoning. An impostor took his place, and soon stole the White Dove of Rinanni.  

The mysterious old one knew of the Dhuvghal, and called them the servants of the Dhuweireor. He said they were like fingers of one hand. The thought of them appeared to unnerve him. Whereas he had been lucid before, he now was confused, being unable even to explain how he came to remember so much of the past. He said that he lived the fantasies or dreams of others. I was standing closer to him now, as folk began to leave, and I could see that the thing that hung around his neck was a leather book.

Those that tried to communicate with him later, found him in a poor state, coughing and so confused that he did not always realize that folk were trying to speak to him. He appeared to be trying to talk to someone else that was not there. He soon disappeared. However, he later used ESP in his madness, and all happened to hear his thoughts. There was a battle in Town Square, but a Secian friend was able to write down his thoughts.

"The smiling dead have forsaken me.
Why. Their voices are silent.
Like the blood in those old cracks.
The eyes of the Choropleth burn. 
His bowels writhe with the Dark ones whose names are erased.
The worlds of the silent and the damned are tied by the discords of pain and forgetting.
It's eyes burn... Burn.
My name is so tired.
No one will know me, and their comfort will leave me alone in my despair.
I am drowning.
And the smiling dead have left me here.
So long. So very long."

Well, that would be scary enough. Except for what happened several days later. I was coming back from visiting the Yelican Forest, when I came upon the same strange, old figure south of Town Square. I turned around to follow, but he disappeared into the gloom. Then he used ESP again. I really think he does this without realizing it, as he yearns to communicate with someone or something out there.

"Where might I find death blood in some abundance?
Why kill?
Killing feeds the mouths that suckle, the mouths that speak.
Killing grows the blackness from which all things come."


Things soon got hectic. I heard stories of young Rijom appearing in different parts of Spur and then dying. I and others spent time in the Southlands seeking clues. On one of these sorties,  I came upon him again in the Rogue Fields. At first, I walked right by him, but then I saw a motion out of the corner of my eye, and turned around. There were several folk fighting rogues, but the old one appeared oblivious to it all. He was pulling up handfuls of blood-soaked grass and stuffing these in a pouch.  I greeted him, saying that I had seen him at the story-telling and had noticed that he knew much of Old Spur. He appeared unsure if he had been there but briefly agreed that he remembered much. I wanted to ask him about some of the famous Hithuals of the past, but I could not ignore the handfuls of bloody grass. I asked about it, and he merely wheezed "Death blood." This did unsettle me, and  I asked, hopefully, if he needed it for a medicine. He would only say, "Medicine is for the living." That book, bound black in leather, still hung from his neck. I asked about it, which was rude of me. He said, at first, that he had no such book. Then he whispered to me that he could not speak of it: "My mind is feeble, and I don't like to remember."

Who is this strange and sad figure? Did he really live 200 and more years ago, or is he some mad and deluded historian? Does that book give him these memories and names or help him forget them? What is his purpose here?

I had the pleasure today of interviewing Michael Stormbringer, the DFC's Editor-in-Chief, and a dedicated bard in spirit and form.  I invite you to join me in discovering facets of Michael's life that you may not have known. [note from editor-gah, she made her's look better than mine ::whine::]

Michael beams to Allandra.

Allandra curtsies at Michael.

Michael bows to Allandra.

Allandra extracts an aquamarine quill and dusty yellowing scroll from her pouch and prepares to inscribe.

Allandra smiles.
 
Michael grins.

Allandra says, "Michael, thank you for granting me this first-ever opportunity to interview you face-to- face."
 
Michael smiles devilishly.

Allandra grins.
 
Michael says,  "My pleasure"

Michael says, "I'm honored to have been noticed for such a task."

Allandra says, "If you'd be so kind as to enlighten me about your interest in bardic prose.  How did you acquire such talent? "

Michael stares up for a moment.

Michael says, "hmmmm"

Michael says, "I've never been one much for fighting, This suits me more to my needs."

Allandra nods.

Allandra scribbles delicately with a small smile as she listens intently to Michael's response.

Michael says, "I do what pleases me, and this is just a love of my life."

Allandra beams.

Allandra says, "That's obvious, truly.  Your poetry has pleased the ears of many."

Allandra smiles.
 
Michael blushes.

 Michael says, "I believe in the power of verse, it is a strong one, one I'm sure, you'll not contend."

Allandra nods in agreement and says,  "It's gratifying to see your support of Spur's Bards, also.  A most worthy enterprise."

Allandra smiles.

Michael says,  "It is sad to see what has befallen the Bards and their way of life here in the Spur."

Michael frowns.

Allandra nods and says,  "Do you have any suggestions or ideas for improvement of the fate of our storytellers and minstrels?"

Michael says,  "For now, be strong of spirit and mind. Do not give up what you wish to be, for it is something they can never take away from your heart.  It is a path one follows, regardless of the rules set by others."

Allandra smiles in obvious agreement.

Michael says, "Look at me, they tell me I cannot be a part of any guild for my race, yet it does not stop me, why should they do the same?"

Michael says, "I feel as welcome and a part of their guild as any other bard would say the same."

Allandra nods and says,  "Of course".

Allandra says, "Now, This question is of a more ...err...personal nature."
 
Allandra coughs.

Michael smiles, leaning forward.

Allandra says,  "You may choose not to answer, but being Society Columnist,  I feel it my duty to ask."

Allandra coughs delicately again.

Michael nods and says, "go ahead."

Allandra says, "Anyway,  I'm sure many Spurian citizens would be curious to know:   does Michael have any romantic interest in our fair city?"

Allandra blushes.

Michael smiles wistfully.

Michael says, "Well..."

Michael says,  "There was once one, in my younger days..but now.."

Allandra freezes the movement of the quill over the tattered scroll, awaiting this most fascinating reply..
 
Michael says, "You understand why I now can write poems and such so freely.."

Allandra smiles.

Michael says, "One must have a pain, or perhaps a loss in one's life for certain prose."

Allandra nods and says, "I believe so......yes, I understand that completely."
 
Michael says, "It is a pain I have drawn upon for some of my works."

Allandra smiles empathically.
 
Michael says, "So now, I have my friends, but I tend to distance myself from all close relationships.  It is something I'd rather leave as a sole venture. "

Allandra says, "Yes, that is perhaps at times sad, but also can be self-actualizing.   Hope does spring eternal, especially to the heart of a bard, mind you. "

 Michael says, "Indeed it is, indeed it does."

Allandra says with a smile, "I do wish you great luck in all your journeys, and trust you will grace our realm with many more fine works to come."
 
Michael says, "Oh, of that, I've no doubt, when the mood fancies me."

Michael winks.

Allandra grins and says, "Is there anything you'd like to share with me, upon which I haven't touched?"
 
Allandra smiles.
 
Michael says, "There is one thing I would say;   I cannot wait to stage."

Michael grins.

Allandra beams.

Michael says, "My time is soon."

Michael says, "...and one of my dreams, to fly, shall be realized."

Allandra says,  " Then I shall write a poem to dedicate that moment, when it arrives.  Its passage should not come in silence."

Allandra smiles.

Michael beams.

Allandra says, "If I would be permitted, of course."

Allandra curtsies graciously.

Michael says, "Of course"

Michael bows.

Allandra says, "I must thank you, indeed, Michael, for sharing these insights with me.  Tis always a pleasure to speak to one whose heart beats with the song of hypnotic lyric and verse."
 
Allandra beams.
 
Allandra says, "May your quill never be silenced."
 
Allandra curtsies at Michael.
 
Michael says, "Surely, twas a pleasure to speak with you today. I have much
to do..much to do.  Being Editor has it's moments, certainly nearing deadlines.."

Michael bows to Allandra and grins.

Allandra chuckles, nods and says, "A daunting obligation indeed."

There you have it.....the spirit of a bard beating in the heart of a Dragon.  An honor indeed to have shared this time with Michael.
