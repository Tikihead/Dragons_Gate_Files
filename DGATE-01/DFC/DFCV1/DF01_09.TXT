=========================================================================== =
Greetings my fellow Citizens of the Spur,

I had perhaps planned on saving this for the next issue, but since this is something of timely, I felt I would step up to the plate and swing away at a few things going on around us. It's not often that we look back at things and actually thank those that deserve a pat on the back, attaboys/girls, and heartfelt thanks. Always are we quick to rip the Elders and staff apart for issues that have nothing to do with them, as Elders. Perhaps it is an issue for IWP, in part, however, this is not the forum for such debate.

I had thoughts running through my head of actions, and thanks to the many concerned, and those that cared, including Elders, I have reconsidered my position and shall remain. I do love this, this Dragon's Gate, and would do what I can to make it a better place for us all. I enjoy my duties as Editor in Chief, and do not feel the burdens that many of the Elders do go through. I would like to say, take a look back recently, barring issues of a new taxing, think about how everything has been enriched lately. Today we see Dragons flying, and in time, I shall join them when my time comes. Take a step back and look at what is being done for you, the Citizens. Life is far better than you would know, having been here from the beginning, and I for one see this, and think this long over due: I would like to thank the Elders and staff for a job well done. Many issues have arisen to stand in the light, always casting poor light upon their actions, well, I for one, shall not sit by and say nothing of this. I will not name specifics, but recent events have lead one or more Elders to come under fire, for something totally trivial. This is sad, regardless of the circumstances, however, as role-playing goes, accept it and move on. I shall not offer opinion on this, however, I am saddened at the degree in which some parties pursue issues, in anything ranging from folks believing themselves wronged, to pursuing others that take actions against them in order to achieve some sort of justice. Remember, this is supposed to be enjoyable, so let's keep it that way. It's not the end of the world, it's just something of a new day. It would mean a lot to me if this reaches perhaps one person that thinks as I do, and applauds the Elders and staff, for a fine job they do, the issues they deal with the best they can, and for making our lives all the more better. 

Kudos to Tilgen and the gang. Relax everyone, as the stress is running a wee bit high. I for one am enjoying myself, and I know it will only get better, as I see everyday. I am proud to know and have worked with the Elders and staff I have had the chance to run in with. Always polite, always considerate, and overall nice folks. It's time the rest of Spur realized this, or at least mentioned something to the effect publicly. I will never regret my time here, I will never wish I'd never have come here, I'd never wish to not know who I've met. And I specially would like to thank Acinonyx, someone I am very proud of.

Yes, I posted this, so sue me, I wanted to put it here as well. On a personal note, I am glad to have finally staged, how sweet it is. I am glad to see everyone sending in stories they write, and I think, since I have receive so much this month, I will release a second issue this month. On with the show.

Sincerely,

Michael

By Guztymne Horawytz - "love"

Whenever Rock entered from the door, Syrgio's heart fluttered.  Every time the giant body moved through the door, and rested near his bed, Syrgio's hands gestured and runes would envelope Rock, invigorating him.  Rock would smile.  They would have dinner, as all sworn-brothers did, and would sleep in their separate beds, much often a pain for Syrgio himself.  This time, something was wrong.

Rock entered the door, and Syrgio rushed to him, and wondered what was wrong.  Trying to change the topic, he demonstrated a new technique of casting he had mastered today.

"See?  Observe the wooden cup,"  Syrgio smiled as he eyed Rock.  He gestured with his left hand, then his right a little later.  Runes danced from Syrgio, and flew to the cup.  Syrgio glanced at Rock, and grinned at Rock's simple amazement at runes.  A fire dart exploded into the cup, demolishing it into uncountable pieces.  Suddenly, more runes came dancing, and attached themselves to the pieces of the cups, making them invisible to the eyes.  Rock stared in amazement, and applauded.  Then, he became sullen again.

Syrgio examined Rock.  Gaping, he found a profusely bleeding wound at the back of Rock's head.  Rock didn't even notice it there.  Syrgio let out a slight whimper, then laid his hands on Rock.  Praying for healing, a small shimmer uncovered Rock, and the wound miraculously healed.  Rock, however, was somewhat stunned by the whole process, and became unconscious.  Syrgio sighed.  He touched Rock's cheeks, and heard a small murmur.

"Orchid...  Orchid.."

Syrgio gasped.  He carried Rock to his bed, and laid down next to him, unconcerned whether anyone would find out or not.  Who cared, anyway?  It was just a small fantasy.  Oh well.  A fantasy must end someday.  Or must it?  He pulled himself from Rock's bed, and left through the door.  He glanced in at Rock, and smiled.  Then, he made his way to the Flower Inn.

The Inn was not really an inn.  It was a famed-prostitute bar.  Syrgio smiled at the wonderfully cliched place, and entered through a curtain of beads.  Enchanted smoke filled the air.  Syrgio detected Set's presence in the area, and it seemed that it was all unreal.  Beauties streamed the floor, tugging at men, drugged with wine.  Syrgio chuckled in his heart, when a veiled female grabbed him by the arm, and pulled him up a flight of stairs.

He whispered in her ear, "I want Orchid."  The girl, chuckling, replied that she would be anyone that he wanted.  He frowned, and looked into her eyes.  Touching her body again, she collapsed, drained.  Syrgio smiled, and pulled her into a chair.  He then went out to look for this Orchid that captured Rock's heart.

"Orchid, don't run away!  Another kiss!"

It was from a room above him.  In that room, Syrgio saw a middle-aged man chasing a young youth around a jade table.  Syrgio gestured at the man, and in a few seconds, a puff of sand touched him, and he collapsed, deep in sleep.  The girl gasped at the use of magick.  Syrgio smiled.

"Orchid?"

The girl looked at him through her hazel eyes, almost enchantingly.  She nodded, and gasped when Syrgio gestured at her.  Suddenly, a ball of fire formed above Syrgio, and slowly metamorphisized into a mace.  The girl screamed, and hid behind the table, to no avail.  The mace struck her, and she laid there, dead.  The man in the room regained consciousness, and shrieked at the dead girl.  He ran from the room, and fell down the flight of stairs.  Men ran from the building in streams, shrieking, and beauties fled to their "mother."  Syrgio descended from the stairs, carrying Orchid in arms.  An elderly woman point at Syrgio, and asked him to leave.  Syrgio smiled, and made his way out with Orchid's lifeless body.  The elderly woman sighed at how Orchid had served her well, but now, she was dead, and the man who uses magick might as well have her.

Syrgio dropped Orchid outside the brothel, and dragged her on the ground by the collar.  He made his way down the quiet dark street, but his mind was no where with him.  He wondered what would happen if he were the one who died.  Would Rock care?  What if Rock had to choose between himself and this woman?  He pondered, dragging the corpse on with him.  Soon, he was at the backdoor leading to his kitchen.

Orchid laid on a single table, lying lifeless, like a small embroidered quilt, a silk butterfly lying on a soft moss rock, waiting for a beast to devour.  Syrgio sighed.  He closed his eyes shut, and knelt before the body.  Laying his hands on Orchid, he muttered a few words, and a glow started from his hands, and covered Orchid's body.  The glow shone from her body, and covered the whole room.  Orchid shimmered in black light, and her eyes opened in a flash.  Her mouth opened, choking on the air.   The glow subsided, and Syrgio rose, somewhat exhausted.

Orchid sat up, and looked in silence at her surroundings.  Before her, a Frontacian with long flowing hair stood.  His eyes bore deep into her soul, and she somehow knew that he was responsible for the magick that happened.  A Frontacian and magick were like a wine and sex to her.  Who knew the difference anyway?

"You know Rock?"  

She nodded.

"Do you love him?"

Orchid blinked.  Rock?  The Frontacian must be talking about that gigantic human who visited her often.  Love him?  Orchid rolled the sequence of events in her head.  This seemed the only way for her freedom.  She nodded to Syrgio.

Syrgio smiled weakly.  He touched Orchid, and she collapsed, like that girl in the brothel.  He then left into a small closet, and sat down alone.  Love was no matter of consequence to him.  He gestured, and then..

Orchid woke from her sleep.  Rock was there.  She pointed to a charred door, and inside, there was only a layer of ashes.  However, Rock felt in his heart that Syrgio, his best pal in the world, was still alive.  Why would he kill himself?  Orchid touched his forehead, and Rock smiled.

The next few months, it just wasn't the same without Syrgio.  Everything took much longer, and it seemed that Rock was a different man.  He decided to travel to Syrgio's grandma's place, since that was the place that he always visited whenever something happened.  Orchid sighed.  Her new found freedom was bound by loneliness, and Rock was a man that she always dreamed for.  Rock made his way to a village, quite close to Spur itself, and searched for Syrgio.

Rock didn't love him.  Oh, stop thinking.  Syrgio poured another drink for himself, and gulped in down.  Rock.. Orchid, that blasted woman.  Why did he do what he did?  Syrgio sighed.  Perhaps, if he had to choose all over, would he do the same?  He drank another, and soon, he was drunk as a hithual.  The Innlady approached him for payment on the wine.  Laughing, he emptied his pockets, and threw 2 silvers at her.  She growled, and shrieked at him.  He felt his ribs being crushed by the vocal...  A banshee!!  He rose, and cast a small firemace at her, but before it struck her, she had clawed at him, and he fell to the ground, unconscious.  He felt the banshee moving towards him, and he knew he was almost dead.  Then, he heard claws striking metal, then a small whimper.  Then, strong arms carrying him from the inn.  Then, he no longer felt anything.

"..did the doctor...  cleric?..  wonder why he did it..  such a grueling day... Orchid..  take some medicine..  Rock..  He's stirring..  been 3 days..  I'm getting a cleric..  be fine..  rest..  Rock...  Syrgio..  He's moving..  he's stirring.."

Syrgio opened his eyes to the light.  Orchid.  She raised a spoon to his mouth, and he drank.  It was bitter to taste, yet sweet to the stomach.  The nectar of Elindale.  How nice.  He had never tried it before, and it was rather thrilling.  He wondered if Rock had gotten it for him.

"I didn't get a chance to thank you,"  Orchid said, smiling at Syrgio.  "For freeing me from that place, for letting me see Rock."

Syrgio smiled.  It was him who let her be with Rock, and how ironic that here he was, depending on her.  He noticed that Orchid had grown much more.. prosperous.  He pointed it out.

Orchid chuckled.  "I'm due in 6 months.  Didn't think that anyone would notice.  I just found out yesterday myself!  I'm going to tell Rock today."

Syrgio's heart felt crushed like a pea plant under the trampling of the foot.  So, Rock made love to this woman.  It was all real to him now.  Rock loved her, for real.  For real.  Syrgio got from the bed, and made his way, staggering, to the door.  Orchid called for him, and chased him down the corridor.

"When Rock comes, tell him thanks for everything.  I have a mission to go to.  When he.."

"Why don't you tell me yourself?"  Rock blocked Syrgio's way.  At seeing him, Syrgio's heart felt the same flutter as he did the first time they met, and every time he thought of him.  Now, he knew that he could not leave.

"I am a very selfish man.  I left, and now that you saved me, I have nothing to give in return.  Just a small present.. from my god,"  Syrgio announced slowly.

He raised his hand, and a dark fog encircled his body.  From the corner of his eye, he saw Orchid cowering next to Rock.  He pushed further for Taath's glory to come forth, and a dark light emitted from his body, uncovering the whole corridor.

"Syrgio.. don't do this."  Rock said.  Syrgio blocked out the voice, and chanted on.  "Please.  For my sake.  Remember how we used to be.  Don't destroy us all."

"All that I can give to the both of you, is a pleasant enjoyable death, my beloved ones,"  Syrgio laughed.

"I love you."

Syrgio opened his eyes, and turned to Rock.  Without his concentration, suddenly, a light emerged from his body, exploding into a fountain of radiating dust.  Syrgio disappeared.

Rock rose.  He never loved Syrgio, but if that was what it took to save his beloved Orchid, he would gladly say it.  Rock carried Orchid back to their room, and closed the door on their past.

:::: an excerpt from the larger work   'LoreMasters of Elidan',   Elven Chronicles, Usilin Archives, Library of Usil Elves, in the year 3118 S.D.  [scribe's note:   Sylvin Days]  of the Usilin calendar-reckoning ::::

One chilly midsummer eve, as we huddled around a meager flame in my homeland near the edge of the great White Forest, my great-grandfather and revered LoreMaster Luan'Thurr graciously agreed to recount his views on the life of a scholar.  Gleaned from his long years of arduous study, here is my recollection of what he said, as I recorded it. 

I asked him with a gentle smile, "Grandfather, can you warm our hearts a little with a story?  The chill seeps into my very bones, and I do so love the sound of your voice."

Luan'Thurr sighed, his gleaming eyes half-lidded with fatigue, and said,  "My child, 'twould take more time than the combined lifespans of this realm's stone-wyrms to share all that I know.  But, to humor you, perhaps some bits of wisdom on the chosen life of a scholar would suffice?"

I clapped, nestling closer to the tiny fire, and readied a glimmering pearly quill to capture his words.

Luan'Thurr slowly took a long sip of warmed elvyn-wine, and began his tale.

He said,  "The days of the White Forest are vast, longer than the known histories of all sentient beings recorded in the Usilin annals.  Its elegant, white birch-essence limbs speak to us of ancient wind, and cloud, and wildwood creatures so seldom seen today."

Luan'Thurr smiled wistfully, and continued,  "Upon this shadow'd, thickly hooded landscape stepped the first wandering sylvyn.  He was, in all respects,  one of the earliest sentient to enter our great forest, back in olden times when Death still stalked the land.

Rhythurras, he was named.  Loosely translated,  it means 'fleet of mind', or  'running mind',  I can't quite recollect.   But I digress.   Rhythurras marveled at the pristine air and crystalline green and white of this flourishing weald, for his lengthy travels had carried him across the merciless Great Waste with nary a sip of life-granting water nor sign of life.  With a sudden yearning born of thirst, he vowed to make it his lifelong home.  Rhythurras then and there swore an oath to nobody in particular, save the sky:   to create a luminous haven bordering the woodland.  Full of resolve, he set to work by next dawn's first light.

For a moment, Luan'Thurr leaned back in concentration, searching his memory.  He then furrowed his brow slightly and began anew.

Luan'Thurr said,  "Ahhh, yes,  now I recall.....let me see.  Oh, yes....Well, for countless moons, Rhythurras labored alone, clearing dry scrub and tangled vines.  He relied on succulent berries and hearty fungi that flourished on the forest floor for sustenance.  One day, at forest's edge, near the tip of the hovering Great Waste, he stumbled upon a giant pit filled with shimmering fluorescent violet rock.  Much of it was already hewn by some unseen gargantuan force. Perhaps an early Oog-ra tribe, he mused.  Painstakingly, rock by rock, stone by stone, Rhythurras heaved and slowly built the glorious structures we see here today.  To each edifice, he fashioned the fallen limbs of white birch-essence trees. With loving care, his weary hands planted around each base the windblown seedlings of celestial white lissa-blossoms and delicate scented orchids.  His promise to the heavens would soon be fulfilled."

Luan'Thurr paused to stretch seamed palms toward the fire.  The dusk moistened with dew and a chill clung to the air around us despite summer solstice.  With a small shiver, I waited patiently for him to continue.

Luan'Thurr said,  "Being a scholar by avocation,  and educated from early youth, Rhythurras paused every eve under the fading shades of twilight to inscribe his day's work onto weathered parchment.  He then carefully hid his cherished writings beneath a sheltering birchroot.  Those very scrolls can still be found today, preserved in our Library of Usil Elves."

With that, Luan'Thurr hunched forward slightly for another sip of elvyn-wine, parched from the telling.  I watched him suspiciously.  My resolve intensified to prevent his untimely descent into sleep, but to my relief, he leaned back with a small groan and continued his tale.

Luan'Thurr said,  "One morning, on a journey back from the quarry,  Rhythurras stopped silent in his tracks.  Before him, striding gracefully along the outskirts of his White Forest, was the most beautiful sylvyn creature he had ever seen.  Lustrous white hair streamed gloriously down her back, her once pale but now sun-burnished skin gleaming in the early morning light.  Clothed simply in an emerald-green mandrake tunic and mud-stained leather boots, her aquamarine eyes flashed as she turned to fix her gaze on him.  Rhythurras clasped his throat as his heart stood still.  In an instant, he forgot his glorious mission.   SHE became his only desire.   'I must have her',  he thought,  as he felt his eager feet compel him to her side.

Warily, the sylvyn maiden edged back at his approach.  A bemused half-smile touched her lips as she said wryly in Usilin,  "I presume this to be your private hunting ground."

Flustered, Rhythurras shook his head, and gulped before he could speak.

Then, with a deep bow, he said,   "M'lady, nay.   Tis the sanctuary of all my dreams.   Please, I invite you in, to see what I have done, to see what I still hope to create."  He cleared his throat and began again,   "But forgive me;  I am Rhythurras, son of Thune'Sar.  Might I know thy name?" 

The lady smiled softly, relaxing her taut muscles for a moment.  Rhythurras watched her slip a pearly flute into her green satchel, from which spilled yellowing tattered scrolls and plumed quills of many colors.

The lady spoke.   "Some call me Luthanial;  I am a daughter of the House Silvy'Nha,  Keepers of the Scrolls."

She pointed off into the distance and said,  "My humble village lies beyond the farthest verge of the Great Waste yonder.   I merely wander here, seeking dried bark and tannisia root for my mother's runes.   Might I pass, and then I shall leave you in peace?"

With dry mouth, Rhythurras spoke again.  "M'lady Luthanial, I beg you, share a small repast with me here.  Pause a moment from your wanderings and let me show you the beauty of this place.......it shall be a great abide for scholars, scribes, and tale spinners, I assure you."

Rhythurras, overcome by a sudden impulse, eagerly shared with Luthanial his grand vision.   His hypnotic words painted a cloistered city of shimmering violet, green, and white.  He spoke of magnificent buildings filled with the collective archives of all the Ages, scroll upon scroll, shelf upon shelf.  Rooms devoted to the arts of Magick, themselves cascading over with untold vials and liquids and tomes of ancient wizardry.  Graceful fountains in every alcove.  Artifacts, study chambers, and more.....

Luan'Thurr smiled softly, and said,  "Listening to this, Luthanial's eyes lit anew and her delicate hands trembled.  Her kin had yearned long for such a place, a wondrous repository for their intricate scrolls.  The very scrolls that now languished in a paltry hut on the outskirts of the relentless Great Waste.  At any moment, fire might consume the labors of their lifelong work.  Luthanial frowned at the very thought.  But here, even a sanctum for her mother's rune-essences and earthen grinding bowls and pestles!  

Decided, Luthanial chose her next words carefully.

"M'lord Rhythurras, I will cease my wanderings, on three conditions.  One, that my kin may reside here, beside your forest, for time unlimited.   Secondly, you agree to store and preserve my family's inscribed Collections of the Known World, appointing me your Keeper of the Scrolls.  And finally, that we muster a scholarly band of Usilin emissaries from surrounding lands.  Their task shall be to traverse the realm and collect all hidden and arcane secrets for our Archives."

Luan'Thurr's eyes twinkled, as though remembering some long-forgotten dream.  I welcomed the brief pause.  My wrist ached with the frantic writing.  Luan'Thurr leaned toward the dimming fire then, lost in memory for a moment that approached eternity, by youthful reckoning.  I valiantly tried to hide my  squirming, quill poised, wanting to hear more.

Luan'Thurr shook himself and chuckled, as he said,   "Of course, Rhythurras ecstatically agreed.  Thereupon, the two set about crafting the greatest library and storehouse of esoteric lore in the known world.  Later, Rhythurras conceded to Luthanial's wisdom once again, when she proffered the name  'Elidan'  for this sanctuary:   Elidan,  meaning in our ancestral tongue,  'Mind of Light'. "

Luan'Thurr smiled at me as he said,  "My dear Aluthrial, the rest is history."

With a poignant sigh, he ended his tale, muttering as he reached for the crystal elvyn-wine decanter to find it empty.  But I remained curious.  His promise of enlightening me to the chosen path of a Scholar stood unfulfilled.  Somewhat nervously,  I dared to broach my question.

I said in a quivering voice,  "Grandfather, such a delightful story.  So THAT was the beginning of our fair city.   But, hmm...but....what of the scholar's Path?  You suggested that a lesson was forthcoming, yet I somehow think I wasn't listening,  perhaps.  I seem to have missed it...."

I coughed with a slight wince.

Luan'Thurr peered crossly at me for a moment, a brief frown creasing his brow.  By now, I struggled to see even a shadow in the dim light of falling dusk, but I clearly heard his deep sigh.

Luan'Thurr said,  "My dear child,  you heard very well.  Except you heard not with your inner ear.  All virtues worthy of memory must come from labors of the heart.  As you travel, collecting your scrolls, noting your histories, never forget that the mind must listen through the heart.  This key alone will preserve the integrity of your works and the truth of your inscriptions.  It grants the power to hear between the lines of messages narrated by others."

Luan'Thurr smiled gently at me, and ran a weathered hand across my hair.  He lurched to a slow pained crouch, leaning heavily on his gnarled willow cane.  Night's gathering gloom quickly consumed his frail figure as I watched him limp away from the fire.  Yet his words rang in my ears.  How could I ever aspire to attain the rank of such a scholar?  Long after his leave taking,  I sat immersed in fretful thought, searching the radiant embers for an answer.....

DEATH'S SPAWN

Scribed by BrotherKharmen ofTheHolyBlade/ DeathsSpawn The Black Dragon

Day 1- I got word from Ceenith that Leuia is in some kind of trouble. She did not explain the problem, but said she was coming right away in the Bleeding Saber. I'm surprised that old ship is still in one piece, but I guess my old mates take good care of her. 

Day 2- On the Bleeding Saber now. Still the same, but the paint makes it  look new. Ceenith is the captain now. The old captain died of some disease about a year ago. After I arrived in Spur. Unfortunately I discovered ol' Grab died of ol' age. Pogus became a governor of some small city in Leuia. I think he'd make a good governor. I hope this time my journey will be trouble free.

Day 3- Nothin' new. Time for supper. Must go.

Day 4- Ceenith won't stop staring at me. That is the only thing that really happened today. The calm sea sure is a beautiful sight. I guess that is all.

Day 5- Nothin' 'cept I'm seasick....

Day 6- Excuse that big stain on the scroll. I was seasick and I am again. Need to go and...

Day 13- We were transed over to the docks of Leuia. I will never forget how this place looks like. Yet it is different. All the Leuians present look frightened and paranoid. Oh well. At Ceenith's father's estate. Nice place. I didn't know she was nobility. Tomorrow she says she will explain this whole predicament.
	
Day 14- Found out what the problem was. A mad Leuian mage who says he is Death incarnate has conjured up scores of undead to ravage the island. He has taken care of two cities so far. We are preparing for a raid that will occur in seven more days.

Day 21- The tower loomed above our raiding party, a huge obsidian black tower. No windows. No entrances. How were we to get in? Just at that moment a small 	 army of skeletons rose from the ground, moaning and groaning. As usual we fought and fought until we were victorious. No casualties on our side. I was cleaning off my sword when three portals materialized before us. So this mage was inviting us in? This was a trap for sure. I was about to warn the others, but was too late. One warrior stuck his head through the first portal. He stumbled back headless. Another warrior jumped through the second, and was turned into a statue of ash. He slowly crumbled away. A mage poked his staff through the third. Nothing. He did it again. Nothing. He put his hand through. Nothing.

"This one is fine," He said and walked through. His head appeared from the other side. " Come on." We were in a corridor filled dungeon. The walls, floor, roof, everything  was made out of ruby. There were even ruby gargoyles and statues. We explored the place for awhile, but soon became lost. Now we are setting up camp. This is hopeless. The corridors are always changing positions. 

Day 30- We have been cut down to ten of us. For six days we had been battling undead. They are ruthless and never seem to tire. Hundreds of them cutting us all down. I was surprised a few of us survived. Need rest. 

Day 31- Odarous. Praise Odarous! This morning we were awakened by a glowing figure of a knight. He pointed to the dead end ahead of us and all of a sudden a door faded into view. He disappeared then, but a magnificent Tigers-Eye Greatsword was laying where he had been standing. I reached out and picked it up. It flashed brightly, blinding us all. When our vision returned I was wearing Giant White Plate Armor! NO! I tried to tear it off, but my hands passed through it like it was mist. I pounded my fist into a wall in frustration and the armor became solid and created a fissure into the once smooth ruby walls. Imagine if a Hand Cleric wore this stuff? Everyone stared at me, gaping. We decided to go through the door. We did and entered a gigantic (I really mean GIGANTIC!) chamber. A cackle broke out and a Leuian dressed in a flowing black cloak stepped out of the shadows. It was the Death Incarnate. Actually it was Death. I was sure of it when his flesh, fur, meat, veins and so on crumbled off of his bones. I gulped.

"Welcome."

"You are not supposed to be in this.. this...!!!" I was at a loss of words.

"Realm!" Ceenith added.

"Death is everywhere, boy!" Death pointed at me and a deathly wail rang out from above. I looked up. Shades. Hundreds and hundreds of Shades were raining down upon us. I prayed, shivering. What else could I do when hundreds of Shades were about to rip me apart. Then my armor flashed brightly and the shades were blown away, screaming as they slowly faded out of existence.

"You will stop this destruction now!" Ceenith ordered Death. 

"Leuia needs a little Death. Leuians are breeding like crazy these days and I am downsizing them!" Death was joking?

"Shut up!" I let a fire eagle shoot at him. It circled his head, then disappeared when Death snapped his fingers.

"You cannot kill Death! I shall take your lives for your arrogance! You cannot challenge Death! Death is forever!" He cackled and began to transform. First he grew taller. A lot taller! Then he grew scales and claws. Then wings, a long tail, and a head. He was a fourth stage dragon now! He roared, so loud that the chamber shook. Acid dripped from his mouth and he stared directly at me and grinned.

I cussed and my sword raised at him. I didn't raise it. It raised itself with me holding it! By my own will I charged at him, waving the sword above my head and releasing a fierce Leuian war cry. I was driven by some force to kill him and banish him from the realm once again. Maybe Odarous. Maybe just myself. He laughed at me. I leapt and dug my sword into his chest. He stopped laughing and groaned. I twisted the sword to make it hurt even more. I prayed to Odarous to aid me as I cut my way down to Death's stomach. My prayers were answered when a bright flash erupted inside Death's head. Another flash erupted. And another. Finally Death's head exploded. He fell to his side, crushing some party members. One of them Ceenith!
"Ceenith!" I yelled and watched as she was lost under Death's huge body.

I groaned and let my grip on the sword tighten. I continued to twist the sword into Death's stomach even though I knew this body he had possessed was dead and he was gone. I shoved the sword in deeper and twisted. I shoved it in deeper again. 

A black mist rose from the dragon's nostrils. It hovered over to me.

"You cannot kiiillll Deeeaaathh!!!" It wailed.

I yanked out the sword and swung at the mist. My sword erupted into a ball of flames and I scrambled back. The mist headed towards me.

"I defeated you, Death! I defeated you!" I beamed at the mist.

"You haave noot, myy spaaawwn!" It wailed and I suddenly felt very weak. I collapsed.

"Stay away!" I cried one last time as the mist enveloped me.

__________________________________________________________
(1 of 2)
The moon shone on Spur, illuminating the night lightly with an eerie glow. Up in the sky a lone Anthian soared past the citizens below, his wings blowing wind in their faces. In protest they look up, but see only the dark red glow of his eyes. 

A small trio of muggers ambush a single Flerian, eyes sparkling with greed and adrenaline pumping through their veins for the upcoming battle.

"Look at the little Flerian," one mugger laughs and takes a swing with his flail.

"Look at the mugger with no manhood!" the Flerian delivers a crushing knee strike to the mugger's groin and backhands him in the face, sending him flying back.

From above the Anthian grins as the other muggers advance the little Hand Cleric, flails swinging wildly and shouts of excitement echoing through the streets. He dives head first, wings tucked at his side, at one mugger and tackles him to the ground. 

"I don't need help. These are only muggers," The Flerian says as he lets loose a few quick punches to his enemy's stomach.

"You do now," The Anthian comments.

Five more muggers approach.

"Okay you can help."

The battle is fast and furious. The two allies send the muggers down with several kicks and other martial arts moves and end their miserable lives with devastating blows to the head. Only one mugger escapes, bleeding and his manhood almost destroyed. 

"Nice job," the Flerian starts to strip the muggers. "Hello?"

No one is there, but a gust of winds blows against his face and up above he sees the Anthian flying away into the darkness.

A small adventuring party of four are wandering though out the Rogues' Field, weapons brandished and runes prepared. Hunting is scarce tonight. Barely any rogues out. Unusual. The past week rogues had been abundant like swarms of insects. 

"Rogues need sleep too," a dragon says to his companians.

"They don't usually hide like this. Every rogue we come across runs away. Especially when they spot K' eyetrios." a Leuian female points to their Anthian friend.

"They are frightened by me," beams K' eyetrios and he extends his wings up above his head and raises his blade.

The others chuckle at his display and continue on their walk, leaving him behind.

"Wait up!" K' eyetrios shouts and runs after them.

The lone Anthian soars in the dark sky, scanning the area below. Nothing but a few Spurians, thieves hiding in the shadows, and some muggers running about. He smiles down at the thieves and hollers down at them, ruining their hiding spots. At last he reaches the Rogue's Field and lands.

"Hmmm..." he squats and runs his hand through the soil before him. He picks up a handful and lets it pour out of his fingers. "I am closer."

The Dragon named Hopus shouts in delight when he spots a rogue, clutching at his bleeding arm. His two Leuian companions and K' eyetrios the Anthian rush by his side and grin when they spot the rogue.

"Oh no, not again," the rogue sighs and begins to run away.

A figure flies past, knocking him down. The rogue grunts and looks up at K' eyetrios grinning and holding his saber to his throat. Enraged, the rogue snarls at him and swings his hand at the Anthian. As he swings his hand slowly transforms into a claw and the Anthian is caught by surprise when a massive amount of blood pours down his face. He looks at the rogue and sees a gigantic werewolf smiling evilly at him.

"Oh-" K' eyetrios yelps.

"My god!" one of the Leuians gasps when the werewolf decapitates K'eyetrios with a single strike with his claws.

The Leuians roar and rush at the werewolf, claws extended. The battle starts and claws flash and spark. Snarls echo out and blood spills on the ground. In the end the werewolf stands victorious over three corpses.

"Umm...I've gotta go...," Hopus transed out and materializes into the Town Square. 

He lands softly on the grassy field, eyes darting back and forth. The field was amazingly calm tonight. Possibly because he was on the prowl this night. Most likely because He had arrived in Spur. In the distance he heard snarls and roars. 

"Hmm," he grins and walked in the direction of the snarls.

Three figures were clawing and biting at each other. The snarls faded off when the two smaller figures collapsed and the last one standing roared loudly in victory. A short Dragon was standing nearby, trying to find a hiding spot. At that moment the Dragon disappeared  in a puff of red smoke.

"AAARRGGGHGHGHGHGH!!!" the tall, furry figure cried in agony and transformed into his normal form, a rogue.

"Another one," the Anthian narrows his eyes and strides over to the rogue.

The rogue looks down at the corpses, stunned that he had somehow done this. Finally he grins greedilly and starts to strip the bodies, drooling in delight. His hands reach into the pockets of the corpses and he pulls out some coin purses. His bliss is interrupted by a cough from a mysterious Anthian standing close by.

"Huh?!" the rogue looks up at him and draws his saber from its sheath.

"Jonny? Is that you?" the Anthians eyes grow wide. "Jonny!"

"Oooohhh.. So our former partner returns to us?" the rogue stands and shakes the Anthians hand.
"You know I left long ago. I am now the one who is hunting you guys down, " he glares.

The rogue cackles.

"In your heart you are truly one of us. You know it as well as we do," the rogue pushes the Anthian playfully.

"Do not touch me!" the rogue receives a devastating kick to his head. He falls back and crumples up into a ball. Several more kicks pound into his chest and behind.

"Hey! Hey! Stop that, F-" the rogue whines.

"Don't say my old name. I have no name now!" the Anthian grabs the rogue by the throat and presses his thumb to the his Adam's apple. The rogue groans and tries to pry his hand loose. He fails miserably.

The Anthian's red eyes glow brightly and he takes off his spectacles. He reveals stunning, evil looking red eyes that seem to look into the rogue's soul. A grin grows on his lean face and the rogue turns pale.

"I know you were one of the ones," the Anthian says.

"What if I was?" the rogue's nails start to grow into claws. 

A backhand strikes his face and he stumbles backward and falls. He looks up and the Anthian is gone. 

"I really hate how you disappear like that, Fe-" the rogue starts, but a poke to his neck cuts the circulation of blood to his brain and he slumps forward, dead as the corpses surrounding him. 

Hidden in the shadows, the Anthian mumbles to himself, "I must find the lair."

Cries of fear rings out in the Town Square. Cries about a massive werewolf and the long dead friends of Hopus the Dragon, who had seen the werewolf with his own eyes. 

Secians fly about, shrieking and laughing to add to the chaos. A little newt runs about, yelling out,"The werewolf is coming!"

"They shouldn't make such a deal about it," a calm voice whispers into Hopus' ear. 

"What?" Hopus gasps and is dragged away into the Mercenaries Guild. He is knocked over the head with a blunt object and he passes out.

He awakens in a small room. An Anthian dressed all in black standing before him. The Anthian sits down across from him and begins the questioning.

My thoughts of These events. Today I grew Tiresome of fighting And just gave up I realized why we praise the second stage dragons. Not because they can fly not because of there height or what they look like but because they have had bonds close enough to everything and everyone to keep busy enough to Not think about what the point of it all is.  And I've come to a conclusion about that which I will get to momentarily Today I saw Acinonyx and Methos and All the dragons and realized I was the smallest not in height no not in weight either but I'm just a level 6 sharps and level 3 channel and I'm 5 months old and that I had cheap diamond mail and only have 10k in the bank cause I gave all the rest away for presents that got me no where but then I I thought about the fact I had little money little skills and little friends and realized I didn't care Because it all didn't matter And what mattered was me I was nice gentle like and Kept my cool Today a guy started slapping me for no reason so I yelled and him told him to SIT DOWN and then I well I treated his wounds and right there it all came clear Why were here why we like our lives even if we hate them at the same time it's because We can help and be something we can better ourselves just by healing or even working on are take off from the ground and I realized I could have real diamond mail level 40 sharps and all the money in spur but I'd give it all away in the snap of my fingers for a nice secian chosen  to be my friend and to talk with and to have great friends like Acinonyx and Methos who seem to be my friends yet would leave in an instant if something came up but still there good enough and if I keep everyday tin the palm of my hand I can live better then any second stage dragon or Godly Creature or even an elder but just to be myself and have ties that bind it would be wonderful absolutely wonderful.

Hithual Goodbye Gathering

Greetings!  Me name is Meqetlh Forgefist.  Me am writing about da events dat took place at da last Gathering of da Colinth Argonix before da governor's new taxation took effect.  As with many others in da Spur, many hithuals were not going ta be able ta afford da new taxes, and were going to have ta leave for their homelands. Many hithuals had already left for da Great Divide, but most that were leaving were waiting until after this latest Hithual Gathering.

Hithuals started filling inta da Great Hall well before da meeting began.  From da beginning, da mood of the assembled hithuals was a bitter-sweet mixture of partying and sorrow.  Soon, a large crowd had gathered, about da same size as da crowd at da grand opening of da hall..  We took our places around da great steelwood gathering table.  Kraggon, in his large forgemaster chair, called da meeting ta order and waved his ale-mug at Armonius, da Reverend One, for da opening prayer.

Da High Priest of Unknown gave another great, touching prayer.  In it he commended da Forge and Anvil for its composure during these trying times, and not being driven to da acts of madness, but keeping true to our natures.  After finishin' his prayer, Armonius was practically assulted by applause and cheers.  Like me said, another great prayer.

Kraggon, ever da voice of reason on control, even in da face of hithual chaos, kept moving da meeting along.  Even though this was da goodbye gathering for many, there was still business ta be attented.  As usual, da next item was da voting in of new members to da Colinth Aronix.  After a brief discussion, all twelve were voted in as members.  Dis was da first meeting me could vote as a member, me was so proud ta cast me first vote!

Kraggon gave a quick report on da sucess of da herb fund, a fund dat had benefitted me with added girth.  Then many of da more experienced hithuals, among those some soon ta be leaving, donated a large pile of weapons.  Da less experienced ones picked through da pile, selecting for themselves fine weapons.  Afterward, da Lady Kalys, da Shield of da Coninth Argonix, reported on da sucess of da recent Hithual Tale-telling.

Since da Lady Kalys was leavin' da Spur for awhile, again due to dat unpopular new taxation, her office needed ta be filled until her return.  Cinzar, da Revelent Killer, and Maddyn, were voted in as acting co-Shields.  We then voted on Council appointments.  Solic was voted in as da Master Bard, FungusAmungus for Brewmaster, and Aedene as Master of Magick.  Congrats ta all!

We also voted ta make ta Gathering meet every two Spurian months, instead of one Spurian month, again due to da soul-vexing taxation.  Then, after a thorough discussion which made me head hurt and me mouth thirst for ale, it was voted for da reluctant Jinko ta draft a pact of some sort with da Dragon Council.  We would vote on accepting da pact at a later meeting.  Kraggon closed da meeting with a excellent toast to those that were leaving.

Da meeting was over and it was time ta party!  Unfortunately, da hithual's private bar, da Kneebiter's Nook, was still out of ale.  At da grand opening for da Hall, Durik and his marvelously gifted miners had brought many varieties of fine Hithual Ale. Somehow, if ye can believe it, da prodigious amounts of ale were all consumed dat night.  We weren't worried, for hithual traders from da Great Divide were ta bring more.  However, da traders had yet ta make one trip ta Spur without drinking all da ale in route.

Since most of us had no ale ta drink, we decided ta have a parade.  Da first thought was ta shout things in hithual, so none would understand us.  Then we decided ta shout something in unison.  Our varied shouts quickly congealed to da most natural and obvious thing for hithuals ta shout.  Ale!  Me had a great time, marching around Town Square and da rest of da Spur, following Kraggon, surrounded by me kin, yelling, "Ale!" and waving me empty hithual huntsman mug.  It was like a Hithual Invasion!

Word came ta Kraggon from Elex dat da elders would give us some ale if we could behave ourselves.  Ale!  Da parade wasn't a demand for anyone ta give us ale, just a bunch of hithuals givin' our kin that would soon be leaving a rowdy send off.  However, none of us were about ta turn down free ale.  We behaved.  Soon, da elder Criagar, who is some kinda acquaintance of Kraggon's, appeared.  He gave out jiggers of rotgut XXX.  They were small jiggers, only holding one shot, but it sure did taste good!

We then headed for da bard's recital ta listen to da new Bard-tek, Solic.  Kraggon cautioned us ta be on our best behavior.  A mob of rowdy, liqured-up hithuals at a society event, what was Kraggon worried about?  Somehow or another, we managed ta behave.  Unfortunately, just after we arrived, Solic had ta leave.  He gave da scroll with his poem on it ta Kraggon ta read.  It was a poem about saying goodbye to those leaving da Spur.  Many eyes, hithual and non-hithual alike, held tears.  Me was able ta hold back me own tears... well, one or two may of slipped out, but who's counting?  It was a beautiful poem.

After reading da poem, we got ready ta leave.  Allandra invited us ta stay for da rest of da recital, but me thinks Kraggon believed da hithual crowd wouldn't be able ta control ourselves much longer, so we said our good-byes and left.  Soon after, da group slowly broke up, as different hithuals had business needin' ta attend to around da Spur.

Me sure did have great fun dat night.  It was a grand time of togetherness with da Colinth Argonix, me clan way from home.  That was one night me won't soon forget!

I was naive. I was the one who left. It is my fault.

I should not have left.

He took her heart, I had no idea, I was away. I was naive. I came back, she was gone.  It was her right to leave. I was the one who abandoned.

I should not have left.

I told her I would be back soon. I was not.

I should not have left.

When I returned, she told me quite happily.  She thought we were just friends.  I thought we were more. I was wrong.  I tried desperately to contain my sorrow, my wounds until she was away. I failed.

I should not have left.

The deck seems to present itself. These were not used in a long time.  The Medicine Cards, they have healed before, when the wounds were not deep. They are deep now.

I should not have left.

Three cards are drawn.  First the Whale.  A majestic whale, in all it's glory. The whale, wisdom, ancient power.  Some now would be useful.  It would be too late anyway.

I should not have left.

Second the Swan.  She was the Swan.  Beauty, gracefulness.  It was why she strayed.  She was the most beautiful person known.  He knew that.  He could appreciate that.

I should not have left.

Third the Rabbit.  I am the Rabbit, running, cowering in fear.  I thought we were more then friends.  I was wrong.  Why do I not just crawl into my hole, where I can disturb none with my sorrows?

I should not have left.

The cards have failed.  The wounds remain, my soul bleeding out. I can feel my will to live slipping away.  I think of what might have happened...

If I had not left.

A brief word from Sordum

This is the guide for new players in dragons gate, something to help insure your experience here is a great one, and also to help you understand what makes a good character. Skill wise, and role-playing wise as well. I hope all of you who are new read this and use it to yer advantage. If anything at all just use some of the ideas for yourself, I know from experience that they really will help. Good luck to all of you who are new!

The first part to starting Dragons gate will be downloading the manual, or reading in its online location you can do both these things in the box marked Archives. .The next thing you will want to do is press the key marked "To adventure" and enter the game to its main menu. The next thing to do is choose the create a character part on the main screen. This will send you to the character creation process. The first thing you will be asked is if you want to create your character with the Character Generator, Speed create, or Insta-Gen. I would use the Character generator choice, it will allow you to put the most detail and really customize your character the way you want it. In the future you may use the other choices, but for now just use the Character generator.

The next thing you will want to do is choose a name for your character. This is a very important part of your character creation, and a part very often overlooked. Choose a name that reflects who you are, and how you like to be. Pick a name that is a real name, not a bunch of random letters. One of the biggest excuses I hear from people with dumb names is that all the good names were taken. I would suggest you sit down and look at a good action adventure, sci -fi, type novel and figure out a name that works for you. Some of these names will be taken I'm sure, but there will be a lot of names that are still open. 

Next you will choose if you want to be immune to player versus player attacks. My suggestion is, when you are playing a game that involves interacting with over 100 people at any one time. You will want to be able to attack and be attacked by players. Simply type "n" here and you are on your way. In the future if you find that you don't like interacting with characters then feel free to make a new character with Player versus played off. 

Next you will make one of the most important choices you will ever make, what race you wish to be. Pull out that trusty manual that you had earlier, and read the description of each race carefully before you decide to be one. I cant help you here, all I can say is pick a race that you feel you could role-play well, and really enjoy. Each race has its pluses and minuses, and until you really have played the game for a while you will not know enough about them to make a choice based on how good each race is. best of luck on this step, and i hope you get a race you enjoy! 

Your next choice in the character creation process is the choice of your alignment. This is crucial to how your character will act in game, and how you will want to role-play them. Chaotic alignment is just that, chaotic. You follow no set rules, you set your own. You are the typical bad guys of the land, or maybe you see yourself as better then everyone else, for what ever reason you don't follow the set laws of the land. Orderly alignment is the belief in the laws and rules of the land at all costs. You are typically the most honor bound and the most likely to help others who have lost there way. Neutral is the halfway point between each of these alignments, you share the best and worst qualities from both alignments. Neutral alignment leaves you open to really role-play however you see fit, just not to much in one direction or the other.

The next thing you will do is roll your stats, (in other words how well you were trained as a child, and how you have matured). One thing most people do not realize is that you can re-roll these stats many times until you get ones you like. The description of what's the stats do for you is located in the manual and I encourage you read them carefully. Underneath the stats where you roll there will be the character classes you are aloud to pick, the more starts next to that class the better the character you have created would be for that class. Watch the stars carefully, decide which class you wish to be before you decide to keep the stats you have rolled. When you finally find stats that fit the class you wish to be (fighter, thief, Barbarian, runemage, etc.) accept the stats, then choose that class.

You will now choose how you are to look, your eye color, your hair color, how your clothes and hair look, and what mood you are in. This all will help make you who you are. Your mood and clothing look can be changed at any time so keep in mind those are not perfect descriptions of your character at all times.

The next thing you will do is choose which god you wish to worship. This is an important of who you are. Go back and read the description of the race you chose and see if it mentions a god that is good for them, or any gods they shouldn't follow for that matter.  For example, Arachnians hate all magic.....So you aren't going to want to follow Sa the god of magic if you are an Arachnian.  Read the description of each god and then go with the one that best fits how you plan to role-play your character. 

Next you will be given the option of beginning your life in the training grounds. If you are a thief this is not an option, you have to begin life in the spur. The training grounds is an area for young characters to build up there skills until they are ready to come to the more difficult spur, where they can be attacked by other players etc. In the training grounds PvP combat is forbidden. You have 30 days after roll-up to get as good as you can, and not have to worry about death. Simply type depart. After your 30 days is up you may loose skills from death, be aware of when those 30 days are over.  I you are not a thief I would suggest you stay in the training grounds until your 30 days is up. In the training grounds you may not train a skill to level 6. The highest you can be is level 5, I suggest you get all the skills you can to level 5 before coming over, they will help you in the long run. A map of the training grounds is available in the archives, along with maps of all sections of the spur. I would suggest the second you are done creating your character you stop and get all the maps you need. If you plan on staying in the training grounds, that is the only map you will need for now.

Next you will be asked if you wish to change the controls on your character (ie: How often your character looks over his wounds to see his health, or checks his fatigue, if she keeps track of the people entering the land, etc.). There no real need for advice here, just Do what you like, my only suggestion would be put no on see all logins. Seeing which people are entering the land can be quite annoying to most newbies who are just trying to walk.

Finally you will be asked if you wish to join the merc. guild. I would highly recommend you do this, not only do you get better with skills for doing so you can also make a lot of money. The best thing you can do is agree to do every mission. Its the best way to make money and  get skills. And there really is no down side to failing a mission. When you are done with the merc. guild you will write the description of yourself. (This is what everyone sees when they look at you, so try and make it very descriptive and have it describe YOU.) When this is done you are set to enter the land!!!! I wish you the best of luck and hope this guide to creating a character has helped you. 

You now have entered the training grounds and you look around, you are in a whole new world. Something you have never seen, and its something that is truly more then even you expected. (Note: IF you are a thief read the guide to being a thief located in the archives.) First off get out your map of the training grounds you found in the archives, under the map section. To talk simply type ' then put the words you wish to say, then hit enter. If you are an Arachnian, or a Monitanian you can not speak common, so you will have to type "a signs <then what you wish to say> then hit return." To move simply type the first letter or two letters in the direction you wish to go. e and return go east, etc.

First go east, then north. Then type read sign to read each sign. (read 2 sign etc. will read the second sign in the room and so on.) Let the signs guide you threw the training ground main training room, it will teach you how to fight, weave magic, and heal. When you have figured out the way your occupation heals, casts, ect. You will want to return back to the map and start exploring. my first suggestion is to go to the bank and deposit your money, so it cant be taken if you ever die. As for hunting and improving your skills I suggest you stick to hunting in the sewers and the east gate area. If you need healing healers normally sit at the north gate waiting to heal those injured. 

As I suggested before get all the skills you have to level 5. Then go to the training area and learn a new one, and train it to level 5. The more skills you have maxxed the better chance you will survive part your 30 days. Collect up a lot of money from hunting so you can afford good armor and weaponry when you go to the spur. Below this I have a guide to nearly every monster you can encounter in the training grounds....And my own opinion on how hard they are. Each * is a difficulty level ranging from * which is perfect for a newbie player to pick on, to ***** which even a older player may wish to avoid.

Practice target- No difficulty here at all, the perfect way to perfect skills. Practice targets don't even fight back, you just beat on them all day.

Rat-* One of the more basic creatures, perfect for a new character.

Slime-* When they hit you with the acid they can hurt a bit, other then that easy to hit and easier to kill.

Large rat-* Tougher then your basic rat, but nothing to big.

Giant rat-*** Hard to hit and hits really hard.

Rodent-** Known as a rat on crack, not to hard to hit but can hit you back for a lot.

Killer rat-**** Ouch is the only word to describe these massive rats. Don't let them hit you and you have a chance.
 
Leech-* Simple creature, very easy to hit and can take a lot. Good for practice.

Rouge-**   Your basic human to hunt. They carry weapon you can sell and money as well. Rouges can be hard, but generally not to tough.

Mugger-*** Tougher then a rouge, and worth about the same cash wise. If you are new dont bother trying to hit a mugger.

Ratman-**** Very hard to hit and they can leave one heck of a mark if they hit you. Finding a ratman isnt to easy to you shouldn't have to worry about them much.

Pickpocket-** Good money, easy to hit but hit back hard as well. Basically the same as a rouge. 

Thug-***  Bit tougher then a mugger. Hits pretty hard but more importantly can take a lot of damage before it dies.

Old rouge-*** Attacks faster then most, hurts a bit more then a normal rouge. Very hard to hit, but worth it if you can kill them.

Flying squirrel-** Heck there just fun to look at, don't try to kill a squirrel!

Dirge-** Hard to hit, weak when they hit you.

Dark Raven-**  Flying....So they are hard to deal with, ravens wont attack you unless you attack them to generally not a problem.

Snake-* Nothing big, just kick em around for a while.

Shade-***** Stay the heck away from these things, Shades are huge. Very few people in the training grounds can even hurt them.

Zombie-*** Easy to hit, but they hit really hard.

Spirit-**** Hard to hit, and hit very hard. Generally something not worth bothering with.

Skeleton-** Good for practice, and even better for money. Not to hard to kill, and they dont hurt you as bad as most undead.

Wight-***** Ouch, see these and run for your life.

Greater Spirit- ***** Same as above, except run faster.

Baby troll- * Not to hard, just watch for the other trolls. Will come back to life after killed.

Young troll-** Hit pretty hard, and can take a lot. Will come back to life after killed.

Troll-*** Tough creature, easy to hit but hit back hard. Will come back to life after killed.

Old troll-**** Stay away from these till you have really good healing. Will come back to life after killed.

I'm sure I have missed a few critters here and there, generally assume if it isn't on this list it isn't to hard. Though don't count on that, anything like Townsman, nobles etc. Cannot be harmed in the training ground, and when you go to spur I suggest you don't harm them there. A townie is simply a townie, a person who does something in the town. If someone sees you harming any type of townie they will attack you normally.

When you have killed a creature type strip <name of target> then hit return. Everything will be emptied onto the ground in front of you that they were carrying. TO pick it up type get <name of thing you wish to get> and hit return. And to open a coin pouch, type open <and the name of what you wish to open.>. if something is locked type unlock <name of locked item> then open it as said above. When you open a coin pouch the money will fall onto the ground so you will need to get the coins.

This is really the base to getting bye in the training grounds. You will develop your own hunting patterns and favorite places as we all do. I hope this guide will help make your character more then it ever would have been. And I encourage you to truly have a great time in the land. if you ever need help simply type assist and someone will come to answer a question, keep in mind they will only answer questions.

Best of luck to all of you, and I hope to see you in the game one day and here how this guide has helped you. Good luck in your travels, and good hunting!
Sordum Corinth.
Master Psycian.

An Excursion Into Madness
By Marigold Lyrian 

He felt it surge through him.  The pain of it. The incredible ecstasy, like a bolt of lightning striking his skin and heating his blood to a boil.  The freshly embedded runes in his arm were still pulsing faintly, sending a roaring throb from his shoulder down to his fingertips.  He traced the outline of the eerily glowing sigils, his hands trembling ever so slightly as he sensed the power flowing from them. 

There was something deliciously forbidden about it all, he thought.  Something absolutely sinful about these new runes that made him tingle with excitement.  He knew that the magick he had unlocked was an evil thing, a thing capable of unholy destruction.  A tiny light pierced the very back of his mind for just a moment, whispering to him the foolishness of what he planned to do.  The light frightened him, so he squeezed his eyes shut against it, snuffed it out.  The light fled, and he was safe again.  He could continue. 

Mebok stared down at the runes.  They were still shining with that strange aura, still humming softly with untold energy.  He gazed intently at them, willing them to bind into the spell he wanted.  The shapes twisted and contorted for a moment, weaving themselves together into a spidery symbol different from the original runes.  The weaving was successful.  In his mind Mebok gave his spell a name, the name he would utter each time he wished to unleash its chaotic power. 

A feeling of accomplishment filled Mebok as he stood, gathering his robes about him and covering his blonde head with a cowl. Under cover of a moonless night he made his way out of the Mage Guild and into the silent square of the Guild District.  The rain that had assailed the lands for the past few weeks was pattering onto the weathered cobblestones and skittering in fat droplets down the building faces, giving everything a slick, black appearance in the abysmal darkness.  A quiet roll of thunder made itself known far in the distance as Mebok quickened his pace toward the gate.

Upon arriving there he noticed a small, quivering form tied off to the ironwork.  Closer inspection revealed a wet and very frightened looking puppy, like those found in one of the farms to the south.  It was bound to the gate by a thin silver chain attached to its gold collar.  Apparently its owner had left it there and gone to train at his guild, and had not yet returned to fetch it.

A glint of mocking compassion found its way into Mebok's eyes. "You poor little beast.  Did your master leave you here, out in the cold?"

The dog whimpered pitifully.

"Well, I certainly don't want to just walk away...who knows what could happen to a helpless thing like you, on a night like this?" 

He prodded the big puppy with a booted foot, and it yelped out softly.  Then he knelt and grasped it in his hands, feeling its body   trembling.  The runes in Mebok's flesh screamed noiselessly.  He gazed detachedly at the puppy in his arms as it continued its fearful whimpers.  Then he cradled it in one arm against his chest, and raised his other hand above its body.  Muscles tightening, then relaxing, he uttered the incantations of the spell.  
A sickly green web shot from Mebok's fingertips and surrounded the puppy's body, then faded.  Its body went limp, but it still squirmed frantically.  Its eyes rolled around in its head, and it released a keening howl of pain.  Patches of fur began to fall off its body, and the skin beneath them peeled and withered.  The flesh turned the same corpselike shade of green as the web had been-it bubbled up and burst, and chunks of it began dropping off.  Parts of white bone were exposed. Within the dog's throat, its vocal cords withered, shrank and dried up, and its cries of agony ended in a tortured gurgle. Still it writhed about, as bones began to soften, marrow seeping from them.  Its brain was eaten away by rot in a matter of moments.  Finally the convulsing stopped. Nothing remained in Mebok's arm but a pile of reeking bones, slowly drying out and turning brittle.  These he cast away from him, and they crumbled to dust as they struck the ground.

The mage turned again and began to make his way out of the gate.  Suddenly an invisible force struck him and knocked him back flat.  A terrible, rage-filled voice entered his mind. It boomed and crackled like dragonfire, invading his entire reality.
"What have you done?  How dare you take the gifts I have blessed you with, and then use them for such foul deeds? How dare you fill yourself with these evil forbidden magicks?"
Mebok gazed around in wonderment, unsure of what was happening.  
"L...L--Lord Sa??"

"Until you redeem yourself and take back your actions, you have no right to call me Lord.  If you appease me, I will accept you once more.  You have one more chance to prove yourself to me. Now begone!"

For a moment a flash of excruciating pain blasted through Mebok's brain, and all he could se was a blinding white light.  When it was gone, Mebok was alone once more.  He shakily rose to his feet, clutching his head, and stumbled through the gaping ebony maw of the gate leading out of the guild district.

His thoughts were in a disarray.  How could he regain Sa's favor?  As he walked to the temple of his god, he went over many ideas.  By the time he passed through the shimmering blue portal into Sa's temple, his mind was still blank. 

When he entered the altar room, a worshipper was knelt down in prayer.  That was when it hit Mebok.  The perfect way of showing his devotion to his lord.
A sacrifice.

Mebok stood behind the reverent nobleman, silent as could be, waiting for the man to be done with it.  Finally, the richly dressed worshipper stood and turned.  Seeing Mebok, he smiled politely and inclined his head in fellowship.  The Psycian nodded back, a false expression of good will on his face.  As the nobleman began to exit the altar,  Mebok shot out a hand and caught him around the throat.  The man's scream was cut off abruptly as a sleep dart struck the back of his neck.  He slumped down against the altar, his finery rustling and jangling as Mebok tore open the silken tunic over his heart.

The scorned runemage reached into his robe and withdrew a wicked iron dagger.  The light from the candles surrounding Sa's altar flickered off the metal surface, reflecting into Mebok's eyes, turning them for a moment from their natural brown to a horrible shade of blood-red.  A smile twisted the corners of his lips as he raised the dagger high over his head.  In a voice cracked with excitement, he called out to his god.

"Sa! Lord Sa, here is my redemption!  I repay what you have given me with the gift of a human life!"

With that, Mebok plunged the dagger down into the nobleman's chest, driving it deep into his heart.  And waited.

For a moment he started, blinked as no blood spurted from the fatal wound.  He still clutched the hilt of the dirk.  Before he could make sense of what was occurring, a tiny indigo bolt of electricity licked out from the wound, touched the weapon's blade.  It grew larger and snaked its way up the dagger, conducting into the cross guard, up through the hilt.  It surged through the ruby pommel, and only then did it leap into Mebok's body.  The miniature streak of lightning climbed up his arm like a creeping, poisonous monster, encircling his shoulder, finally tangling itself around his entire body.

As the magickal current shot through him, Mebok was filled with a bone-jarring pain, a gut wrenching agony similar to how he had felt as he was augmented with his new runes.  But this time the pain was not that of a thing being added to him; rather, that of something being violently torn away and ripped from his flesh.  Every molecule in his makeup seemed to break away from the rest, splitting him asunder from head to toe.

When it was over, he was...changed.  At first he could not tell what had happened.  Did the temple suddenly grow?  For the altar now stood high above him, as the governor's mansion might once have done.  Then he realized that, no, it was not the temple that had expanded in size.  He himself had shrunk.  He looked down at himself, and his skin was an angry red.  His toes and fingers were webbed together,  like some sort of monster from the swamps.  But these things were not what he noticed.  There was something else, something that was missing.  From the corner of his eye he noticed his arm.  Where once his runes and sigils were proudly emblazoned, now there was nothing.  His magick had been taken away from him.  A voice came into his head, the same as before, but softer now.

"You were warned, and you did not heed the warning.  You sought redemption in the blood of another, and by the same evil magick no less.  You have thrown away your last chance, and now you see the consequences.  You are never again to use the magick you once held so dear.  You are doomed to the most hideous and pitiful form on this earth, and you may only hope that those you once oppressed will now have pity on you."

A wave of pure despair washed over Mebok.  He fell to his knees and clawed at the floor, releasing a howl of misery.  His cries echoed through the empty temple, and out of the portal into the streets without.

Alone in the temple, Mebok fell into a dreamless sleep. When he woke he would remember none of his past, none of the deeds he had done, none of the magick.  When he woke, he would know nothing but the form he had been cursed with. His sanity would slowly ebb away until nothing was left of him but a husk, a shell.  The last thing he saw before he drifted off was the image of a sparkling Sapphire Newt, an icon that glimmered in the back of his mind, seeming to taunt him, somehow...

And outside, over the abandoned, storm-swept bricks of Enlightened Path, the echoes of Mebok's scream were caught up and devoured by the shrieking winds.

Society Column            Byline:  Allandra Shadowfax

With heavy heart and shaky quill did I write this month's column.  Many farewells have shadowed our land;  many friends have passed beyond our borders.  To those embarking on chosen journeys, I wish much luck and happiness.  Your presence in Spur leaves an indelible mark not soon forgotten.  But even in this time of tears, there comes a song of rejoicing.  For we have also witnessed the staging of dragons with delight.   And still share the comforting company of friends.  From out of ashes, the rise of hope and new beginnings is always possible.  And always, the sound of poetry and song lives for eternity in our hearts.

This month's Championship Recital shared messages bittersweet.  The talent, as always, was sterling.  First Place congratulations go out to Marigold and Solic, but alas, I have not their works to share with you.  Congratulations also to Grob for Second Place, whose poem follows...

Second Place Championship Prepared Entry

An Adventure in Music              by:   Grob and Tastee the Raven

I walk and walk along the trail
Until I see a place
And all of those I stop and hail
None have my hairy face.

Many that see me run and shriek
And tell me "Go away!"
I don't know why, I'm not a freak
But this won't end my day.

Soon I reach a building and wall
Old, but well kept and bright,
Was food there?  I ready my maul
And look about to fight.

Then I do see, with eye uncouth
Each person has a thing
And when they put to their hands or mouth
Great noises does it bring.

I decide that I want one
And look 'round for a door
But finding none, I have some fun
Bashing walls with a roar.

I hit the wall there, with my head
The noise!  Something has smashed!
The people near, and think me dead
But no!  The wall has crashed!

This school of music has a rule
That any who come in
May test their skills, even a fool
To deny would be a sin.

So in I come, to be a Bard
And am handed a harp
I slam it there on my head heard
When asked to play D Sharp.

An old Fir now has quite a fit
He calls me big and dumb
But thinking some, he bids me sit
And gives to me a drum.

This drum is old, and very grand
The greatest of its kind
Its beauty sounds with any hand
Sure not an easy find.

I take a breath and my hand falls
So hard I pummel there
That down about me come the walls...
The building made with care.

I don't know why, but now it seems
They don't much like me here
So on I run to fulfill dreams
And eat, and get some beer.

I try -- after I hunt and lurk --
Music another time
Although my Bird does all the work
And makes up every rhyme.


In closing, to all of you, let your hearts sing with the beauty of verse.


Minstrel's Musings

Many Bards have wandered to our land, stayed a while, and travelled on...... a minstrel's life is often marked with endless journeys and long winding roads.  I received a verse from one who requested anonymity, which I'll share with you now.  And I contribute a new work of my own to commemorate the endings and beginnings all have recently faced.

Sorrow             by:  the Anonymous bard

I was naive.  I was the one who left.  It is my fault.
I should not have left.
He took her heart, I had no idea;  I was away.
I was naive.  I came back, she was gone.
It was her right to leave.  I was the one who abandoned.
I should not have left.

I told her I would be back soon.  I was not.
I should not have left.
When I returned, she told me quite happily --
She thought we were just friends...
I thought we were much more.
I was wrong.  
I tried desperately to contain my sorrow,
My wounds, until she was away.
I failed.

I should not have left.

The deck seems to present itself.
These were not used in a long time.
The Medicine Cards,
They have healed before,
When wounds were not deep.
They are deep now.
I should not have left.

Three cards are drawn.
First the Whale.
A majestic whale, in all its glory.
The whale;  wisdom;  ancient power.
Some now would be useful.
It would be too late, anyway.

I should not have left.

Second, the Swan.
She was the Swan;
Beauty, gracefulness,
It was why she strayed.
She was the most beautiful person known.
He knew that....he could appreciate that.
I should not have left.

Third, the Rabbit.
I am the Rabbit, cowering in fear.
I thought we were more than friends.
I was wrong.
Why do I not just crawl into my hole,
Where I can disturb none with my sorrows?
I should not have left.

The cards have failed.
The wounds remain, my soul bleeding out.
I can feel my will to live slipping away.
I think of what might have happened...
If I had not left.


From the Eye of the Palantir        by:  Allandra Shadowfax

A  storm of molten madness
Swirls round a darkling sky;
A shriek howls from its innards
As eagles heed its cry.

Tempest pounds the westwood
And froth flicks at the lake;
No tree nor rock is safe now,
All Might falls in its wake.

The bellow of a thunderclap
Resounds across the sky;
Stark slivers pierce the darkness
As lightning flashes fire.

'An omen,'  some say sagely,
With nods and muttered sighs;
But others watch them closely,
See fear behind their eyes.

As roiling clouds swoop lower
And sirenwinds abate,
A voice speaks out the darkness:
"Friends, listen, and please wait;
Behind a rim of bleakness
Ride sunbeams golden bright;
For when the tempest passes,
A clearing brings new light.
Bow not your heads in sorrow,
In memory, all reside,
And when the veil is lifted --
I will be at your side..."

You see Michael drink from some black Dragon ale.

Michael chuckles.

Michael says, "any names?"

Methos says, "just don't ask me to do a round now"

Michael says, "anyone you'd care to embarrass?"

Michael grins.

Methos says, "well, Zaargo, I love em, but he tends to take the games a bit.. personal"

Michael nods.

Michael says, "aye, so I've heard."

Michael chuckles.

Methos says, "but he is a great warrior that I would be honored and relieved to have on my side any day"

Michael nods.

Michael says, "aye, true."

Michael says, "Champion of Odarous or somesuch, isn't he?"

Methos says, "something of the sort"

Michael chuckles.

(Methos clutches himself from falling out of his chair)

Michael says, "I see you've amassed some new toys along the way. I'm sure they love those."

Methos looks like a 7'2" standard immature massive boned, very muscular bodied Dragon.
He has silvery eyes and looks razor-sharp.
He appears to be in a mischievous mood right now.
He can be attacked by other players.
He appears to be in perfect health.

                        Visible Equipment

Some black tight leather pants                     (pants)

Methos says, "well, the armor was famously popular when I first aquired it, since I was the first to don the finest mail that Rehas can make"

Michael smiles as he removes a small wood pipe.

Methos says, "But, several other people have armor of the same quality now, so its not quite as attention getting any more"

Michael stares down at bag of some Thugara.

(Methos hiccups)

You see Michael drink from some black Dragon ale.

Michael smiles as he lights the pipe with a burp.

Methos coughs.

Methos says, "hmm, where were we?"

(Michael motions to the Secian in the corner to strike that.)

Michael says, "hurm"

(Methos mentions to his friend that we should do this in a more private place if a similar situation should arise again)

Methos says, "Well, most of the credit has to go to my teammates when I'm on a team, and with the people I form alliances with in a free for all.  But, I like to be the one little thing that pushes my team or my alliance mates over the top."

Michael nods.

Michael nods.

Michael chuckles.

Michael nods.

Michael says, "if I recall"

The roadside about you is lined with old crypts and worn obelisks. These were placed here by those who could afford them to mark their final resting places. There is a strange odor in the air as well.
