  Here it is, the third issue of the DFC. This one is packed full of 
excitement thanks to our numerous contributors, and I think you will really
enjoy it. First, back by popular demand, we have another interview by 
that Thugian runemage Crunch. His subject this time is Skratchnar the 
Leuian, a Khat I am sure many of you have seen around the Spur. We then 
move on into some fiction. First, their is the second part of Lorelei's 
story detailing her first meeting with Arrrg the Dragon. This is followed
by Gristle the Runemage's account detailing the events which brought him and
his brother Crunch to the Spur.
  Leaving the fiction behind, we have another one of those inane lists that
these Secians keep sending me. Once again, I shall leave it up to you to 
determine how useful the advice contained within it could be. The list 
is followed by our main feature for this issue. As promissed, Thistleroot 
the Secian and Acinonyx the Dragon have been hard at work determining 
where the Dragon/Secian bond first originated, and why. This feature has
been divided into two parts, one for the Secians(which I will not even 
pretend to understand) and one for the more litterate races of the Spur.
I think that what they have found may surprise you, it certainly did me. 
  In addition to this main feature, we have something else which may 
engage your attention. One of our reporters seems to have found an 
authentic web spool sent out by that shadowy spider Ttrrachkkchirrk 
Arkkatatrrk. We do not know what this may mean for the rest of the Spur, 
but we present it to you as a warning of his possibly evil intentions.
  Rounding things out we present an article for some of our readers who 
might be new to the Spur on the various weapons availible for purchase, as
well as our various staff projects such as the letters to the editor, 
hearthstone poems, Rumors, and rise of the Classes section.
  So, enjoy this issue, and keep those submissions coming.

(Editor's note: We tried, really, we did...we wanted to make this thing 
                more inteligeble, but Crunch took one look at our finished
                copy and said, "You prints dats copy and I tear of dat arm 
                use got and feeds it to Gristle." So, after assesing 
                Crunch's size, I determined that it would be in the
                best intrests of our readers to present this interview just
                as it was given to us. -Rags)

insident like las week. Finully, affer me paid fer de horses dat Gristle et,
him let me in de place.  Heded up to de thurd level an beet on de door, an 
me budde himself opened it. Ifn me remember it rite, it went sumtin like 
dis.................

Crunch (eyeing the cushions and and other accommodations):  "Nice place ya 
  gots heer......"

Skratchnar:  "It serves a purpose from time to time as I occasionally need 
  a place to reflect or speak in private"

Crunch:  "If ya say so......still a nice place"

Crunch (Muttering a bit as he settles his bulk the long distance to a 
  cushion):  "Didna havta do de inturvue in private......it gonna be red in
  de paper ennyhow"

Skratchnar (Smiling as he pours two cups, Crunch's for some reason made 
  sturdily):  "I thought perhaps you'd like to get the interview in print 
  before it hit the streets"

Crunch:  "Oh.....yeah, rite.  Me do.  Good ideer."

Crunch:  "Mite as well start.  Me herd dat yer part o de Pride.  Offishiul 
  Spur branch, at dat."

Skratchnar:  "I am currently the MajTai of the Pride.  That is the Pride 
  Council's Member from the Runemage segment of the Pride.  That, like 
  other positions, is an elected one.  We should have an election soon, 
  with the pride membership grown as it has.  But the timing of that will 
  depend on our members, as most things do."

Crunch:  "Well, how'd ya git it in de furst place?"

Skratchnar:  "I helped with the formation of the Pride here in Spur, and was
  selected on a temporary basis until we have elections.  I hope to continue
  to serve the Pride in this position, but the elections will determine 
  that."

Crunch (Distracted by a shiny object): "Wut's dat fancee ting on yer fingur.
  ....me nevur did see dat afore"

Skratchnar (With pride):  "It is the Order of the Gray Mane.  It was awarded
  to me by Garralt, High Khatyr of Leuia.  For my role in the organization 
  of the Spurian Pride."

Crunch: "Oh"

Crunch:  "Wid all de werk ya doin wid de Pride an all, ya couldna have no 
  enemas heer in Spur"

Skratchnar (After a moment's sorting):  "Enemies?  I may have one or 
  two.......I have, you might say, Corrected some citizens for both criminal
  and loutish behavior.  Though I prefer to think that they learned from 
  the experience, some may hold a grudge.  If they feel need to satisfy 
  said grudge, they may feel free to contact me and I will settle the 
  matter.  It would also be true to say that any who take that which does 
  not belong to them are my enemies.  Or for that matter, those who would 
  harm an innocent.  Leuians who behave in this manner, in particular, can 
  count on seeing me in the future.  To.....correct their behavior."

Crunch (Hairy eybrows scrunched together):  "Dis gotta be one o dose honer 
  tings yer talkin bout.......tell me bout honer"

Skratchnar:  "Leuian honor, despite the fact that you hear it commonly 
  mentioned, is a redundant phrase.  A true Leuian is, above all other 
  things, honorable.  We keep our word, respect the life and property of 
  others, we speak truly.  Those who do not; they are not Leuains.  They 
  are Tarr'Khat, the lowest form of existence."

Crunch (Finally tasting his tea):  "Dis stuff doan taste so good.....got 
  enny more?"

Crunch (Accepting the refill offered by his host):  "Tanks.  So watcha got 
  plannet?"

Skratchnar (Adjusting himself a bit on his cushion):  "For the moment, I 
  plan to focus much of my energy on the education and recruitment of 
  members into the Pride.  The young ones are learning the Olde Ways, and 
  this is important.  With our numbers growing, and a smooth running 
  organization, the Pride should soon have a significant impact on the crime 
  rate here in Spur.  Not only through enforcement of the laws, but also by 
  example.  As civilized members of the community, giving a good example to 
  others of how to conduct oneself with Honor in society."

Crunch (With a grin):  "Wut bout dem Leuian tieve's?"

Skratchnar (With a smile long on tooth):  "A Leuian who steals has no Honor.
  As I said before, a leuian without Honor is Tarr'Khat.  I believe they 
  should be shaved, painted green, and simply viewed as a mutant form of 
  gobie."

Crunch (Chuckling at the thought):  "Me gots lotsa good stuff heer.  Dere 
  enny werds o wisdem ya  wanna pass roun?  Dis be good chance ta spred yer
  ideers fer free."

Skratchnar (After only a tiny pause):  "Dishonor is like a scar upon a tree,
  which Time, rather than healing, will only cause to grow larger."

Crunch (Rising to his feet):  "Dem's wise werds, metinks.  Tanks fer yer 
  time.....an de tea.  Yer a good fren an a good inturvue.  Dis ben fun."

Skratchnar (With a gracious smile):  "Any time, my friend.  I, too, have 
  enjoyed the talk."

Crunch (Eying the cushion that bore 600lbs for way too long):  "Sorree bout 
  de damage.  Tought me felt de flore mitee goo dere at de end."

Skratchnar (With a shrug and a wink):  "Think nothing of it.  I always 
  wanted a rug with that pattern."

Crunch (With a grin):  "Knoe wut sumbodee sed ta me yesturdai?  Ask me ifn 
  me wuz tryin ta pass ya in de guild?  Tought dat wuz funnee.......tinkin 
  de guild wuz fer compeetin an stuff. Wutcha tink bout dat?"

Skratchnar (Smiling as he and Crunch walk out the door):  "Let them think 
  what they will.  We know that the guild is there so that we may help the 
  younger ones.  That's what counts.  So long as we never forget it, what 
  others speculate is of little importance.  By the way, did you notice the 
  diamond to ruby ratio from gold chests this past week......I think I may 
  have found a pattern....."

     Dat's where me notes stops.  Me fingurs gitted mitee tired, let me tell
ya.  Ya oughta try holdin a ritin tool in fingurs dis big.  Wish dey woold 
maik sum stuff fer thugs ta use.  Gonna hire meself sumbodee ta do de ritin

Da alwaiz sed she wuz a dictaiter at home.  Me jus never did see de guy dat

                       Part 2 continued:

 "I can see that, you silly reptile!" she hissed, coming out of her crouch.
She moved out of the alley quickly. Her long strides carried her past him 
and out onto the street before the startled dragon could even turn. He 
followed hurriedly, trying desperately to keep up. He admired her physique 
even as he jogged after her. Standing well over two meters, she was a fine 
specimen of her species. He started taking inventory, starting with her 
long legs, made shapely by sinewy cords of muscle.
  The mugger didn't bother the Leuian as she strode past his hiding 
place. Although she didn't perceive him, he knew better than to ambush one 
of her kind. When he saw that the dragon was not her companion, though, he 
decided to attack. The skin, even this early in the growth cycle, would keep
him in ale for a year. He leapt from the shadows, swinging his mace into 
the dragon's torso. Stumbling backward, the reptile shook off the pain 
quickly enough to see the cat-woman turning the corner of the next street.
  "Wait!" he yelled in desperation. He leapt to his feet, and began to run 
towards her. The mugger stopped him from leaving, an evil grin on his face.
With a snarl, the dragon grabbed his maul and swung with both hands. The 
heavy weapon impacted on the mugger's left knee, and sent him howling to 
the ground. He straightened, preparing to return the blow to his opponent. 
The sight of the Leuian striding towards him, clearly in a fit of rage, 
startled him. She was with the dragon after all, he thought, and swung at 
this new threat.
  She didn't even break stride as she stepped over the low, horizontal 
swing. Her foot continued in its natural motion, the last part of her step 
accelerating into a snap kick. It impacted with a sickening thud across 
the bridge of the nose. The mugger slumped to the ground, his unseeing 
eyes wide with shock. "What do you want?" she demanded, ignoring 
the rapidly cooling corpse at her feet.
  "I am not a dragon!" replied Arrrgh. He stopped, as one of her eyebrows 
raised slightly. "Well, I am a dragon, but that is not what I meant," he 
stammered. She tried to maintain her cool as an amused grin began to creep 
along her mouth. "My name is Arrrg," he declared, rolling the R for as 
long as he dared. "Arrrg Imadragon. Not I am a dragon. Imadragon!" he 
finished quickly, blushing at her bemused expression.
  "Lorelei Nilsfulcentruali," she returned, bowing low. "I am pleased to 
meet you, Arrrrrrrrrg" she said softly, her rolling R turning into a loud 
purr. He felt goose bumps rise quickly along his skin as her eyes met his. 
She continued the purr as she leisurely looked him over. He did the same, 
trying not to stare at her. It was hard not to do, since she wore nothing 
except the fur of her heritage, and a small black amulet around her neck. 
"And what can I do for you on this rather... cold... night?" she smirked 
as she noticed the goose bumps along his arms.
  Arrrg blushed, and began to smooth the upraised scales as nonchalantly 
as he could. "Well," he said quickly, "what are you offering?" He tried to 
leer at her, but his composure was too ruffled. His spirits fell as the 
wonderful sound coming from her throat stopped. She continued to smile, 
but her eyes narrowed, and she turned to leave once more.
  "Twas not an offer. You approached me, remember?" She was disappointed, 
but not surprised. There had been a huge influx of dragons into the 
Training Grounds lately. They were all first-stage, of course. Humanoid in 
shape, lacking in maturity, they had flocked to the opportunities for 
training and treasure. Treasure which was meager in comparison to the 
hoards of their elder brethren, but treasure nonetheless. Lorelei knew 
that maybe one or two out of the three score she had seen so far would 
grow to full maturity. On reflection, she knew none at all might be a safer 
guess. The road to full growth was a long one, and filled with dangers 
that she could only imagine.
  She looked Arrrg over one more time, preparing to take her leave. He was 
a handsome specimen of the breed. Standing a few inches under six feet, he 
was extremely large for his height. Muscular to the point of almost bulging 
against his clothes, he exuded an aura of strength. His red eyes were busy 
admiring her body, even as she studied his. 
  For a moment, with the inner eye that showed her where to place a kick or
how to avoid an attack, she had a vision. She saw this young dragon at full 
growth, his humanoid form discarded with joy. The small scales had become 
mighty overlapping plates, impervious to attack. The wings had flourished 
to gigantic proportions, capable of carrying the sinuous body on the wind. 
In her mind's eye, Arrrg opened his mouth and breathed a stream of fire 
that could melt mithril. She shook her head slightly as the vision cleared.
  For his part, Arrrg didn't know why her steel-hard eyes had softened, 
but he saw an opportunity to rectify his earlier blunder. Stepping close 
enough to smell the sweet musk of her battle scent, he took her hand in his.
"Forgive this humble dragon, milady" he crooned apologetically. "I was 
overcome by your beauty, to say nothing of your prowess in battle." He 
bowed again, his lips brushing gently against the back of her hand. 
Straightening quickly, he released her hand. Where it had touched his 
palm still burned. He dared not hold it, though, for fear of losing 
this chance.
  "What I meant to say was I wanted to invite you to dine with me. Would 
you honor this poor reptile with your company?" He held his breath as she 
stared deep in his eyes. His heart pounded wildly within his chest, as a 
long moment gave birth to an interminable pause. He began to wonder if he 
were in fact hallucinating. Perhaps he had proposed a shared meal to a 
statue; so still was the cat in the moonlight.
  "And what would the purpose of this meal be?" she inquired softly. Her 
eyes seemed to have softened further, but she still was not smiling. 
He regretted having to make his offer like this. He had meant to ply her 
with fine cream, always a weakness of her kind, before springing his idea. 
He had noticed her weeks before, and had made his choice. Others were 
bigger, or faster, or possessing of stronger magic. But none were more 
determined, and none would be more pleasant to spend time with.
  "What would you say to a hunting partnership?" He smiled as she stepped 
back, startled. He could see the thought running through her mind. He 
watched carefully for any sign of her feelings, but there were none. 
When she opened her mouth again, his breath stopped, afraid to interrupt 
her.
  "Just what would be on the menu of this meal?" she purred as she took his 
arm in his. Together they strolled into the night.

                        The History of Grunt.


                       By:Gristle Bonebreaker.


    Let it be known to all that I, Gristle, paid a shadowlord a great deal 
of money to lease a Usil elf brain for 30 days or so.So if this seems 
a little to artistic and creative, it's not me, it's this blasted brain 
babbling again. For your enjoyment, I'll even attempt to use correct 
spelling and other things including punctuation.

                         The Early Years.

    Way back before the modern times when Spur was only a Rijom outpost
there was a very odd happening in a thugian tribe far away. The largest of
the large females of the tribe became a mother.(Actually she became a mother
of two counting Crunch.....us being twins and all.)  Moms had only been 
pregnant for six years....so we were a bit immature. Both of us only weighed
a frail fifty eight pounds, but we grew quickly. We kept the whole tribe 
busy feeding us...they were always out looking for things for us to eat.
Ol'uncle Smash said that they aughta have fed us to the marsh reapers, but 
everyone knows that we would have came outta that a bit fatter and more 
scarred up.

                         How we learned magick.

    During our childhood Crunch and I were out adventuring. We had to go out
alot in order to feed ourselves anyhows, and besides we liked to explore.We
went far outside our normal hunting grounds in search of a critter big
enough to feed both of us.(Oliphants were only like appetizers to us.)Crunch
tripped on a rock and fell into a rather large opening in the ground. I
followed him just like always. This place was strange....but beautiful. We
journeyed deep into this cavern. The whole area began to warm up...and the
walls were made of sheer glass. And there it...well....he stood. This thing
was big,no bigger than that,this thing was huge. Crunch began putting on his
bib and got out his fork and knife. I did the same. Just as we were about to
"dig in",smoke rumbled out of this critter's nostrils. We pressed on...until
its eyes opened. They were huge...bigger than any rock I could carry. It 
said, "Why have you come into my cavern mortals?"We backed off...we learned 
long ago not to eat things that were bigger than you that could talk. We 
snorted and grunted abit, and then struck up a conversation with it.He told 
us that his name was Mallan'a,and that he was a dragon. We had never seen 
one of those before...and wondered what he taste like. Mallan'a asked us why
we'd come,so we told him that we had come to eat him. About thirty minutes 
passed, and he finally stopped snorting and chuckling. So he finally offered
a deal to us...and it was as follows:

              We the hereby mortals agree not to eat this
              Dragon, and shall never reveal his cavern.
              In exchange, this dragon offers you your lives,
              and also training to be warriors.

    He got us to make marks on this piece of paper. Then he explained it  
to us and so forth.

    We began this training and discovered that we sure were glad we didn't
try to eat this guy. He taught us ways to kill oliphants without ever 
lifting a spear. Magick he called it...Crunch and I caught on right away. It
was fun, but really hard to understand. It took us many years to become 
good at it,and a few more to become really great. So we decided with all 
this magick power we now had, we were gonna go back and kill the dragon.
We still thought he would make a great meal. Big mistake. We started 
casting at him, and he made a tailswipe at us, slamming both of us
into the wall. He said, "I figured it would come to this." And with a wave 
of his claws we were in another land.

                          The Spur.

    This new place was very strange. It had a statue of two big dragons 
where we arrived. This was a town. It was new on us, we'd never even seen a 
building before. And the streets! They were filled with every sort of  
talking creature around. There were even dragons here...but nothing like 
Mallan'a. These were smaller versions with bigger attitudes. This town,
called Spur became our new home. There was food everywhere, and as long as 
there is food, we are happy. Also we have met the little guys called 
secians. They wiz and dart around in the air. They are great for amusement.
You drop a rock on the ground and they try to pick it up...no matter how 
big.

                          That's about it.

(Editor's note: Thistle and Aci both assure me that this is the official 
                history, on how the bond came to be. I for one will believe 
                that I am related to a Secian, no matter how far into the 
                past, soon after I wed a Psycian. -Rags)

   Long ago dere was da Dragons, and den dere was the Frontacians.  Tha 
Frontacians want to enslave all of da other guys, but kinda stayed away from 
Dragons, since they had a tendency to be cranky and smoosh little humanoids 
like bugs.  Then one day da Great Change swepted over da world leaving all 
Dragons sterile, except for dose dat were in contact with Frontacians.  In 
this change, the Dragons became more humanoid, and the Frontacians became 
more Dragonish.  These Frontacians got wings and a link just like da 
Dragons, but lost da precious gems in dere foreheads and palms, and makin' 
dem kinda short.  Since dey was livin in a place called Secia, dey call 
dese new little flyin' guys Secians.  At first da Dragons no like 'em, but 
eventually da Dragons figger out dat da new babies and tha Secians liked 
each other a bunch.  Then one of the Dragons started actin' funny and was 
in great pain.  His favorite Secian hopped over and used his Empathic 
healing powers to help the Dragon, causing pain to himself, but completing 
the stage for the Dragon, makin' him more Dragonish.  Now, da question me 
askin is, why do we Secians help these Dragons to become big things that 
might step on us at great pains to ourselves?  The first answer is that the 
Dragons protect us, but if'n you ask any Secian (including me) you will 
find that we're pretty independant if we need to be.  Though having 20 
feet of scaly death on yer side isn't all that bad, it doesn't explain all 
of our involvement with them.  Another reason could be that when Secians 
and Dragons went through the Great Change, parts of their psyches were 
transferred, which explains the Secian link and the appearance of wings.  
This exchange left both Dragon and Secian searching for each other.  When 
bonded, the Secian and Dragon exchange the other parts of their psyches 
back, making them both feel more whole.  This also makes the two linked 
forever in one of the closest bonds known in the lands.  When asked, many 
Secians reply that they always have and always will love the Dragons, and 
that is the only reason that they are so friendly to the Dragons.  I don't 
believe this for a second.  It may have been and always will be, but there 
is something rooted more deeply in the Secian's and Dragon's souls.  Maybe 
something will finally explain this, but unless Elindale herself comes down 
wielding a bunny of knowledge, it might be quite a while.  As me Great 
Uncle Fuster once said, 'Everyone is special and has their own 
ideas...except Thugians...they're just big and dumb.'

                              Becoming One

by: Acinonyx Aquilar

  Thousands of years past, across ages come and gone, the world as we know 
it today did not exist.  As I wander through our realm and see each 
different race, I am constantly reminded of everything that has been 
altered.  Of the races today, only three can be traced to before the Great 
Change:  the Frontacians, the Psycians, and the Dragons, though not all 
are as they were.

  Early in the Second Age, the Frontacians had created a vast and powerful 
empire, one by one conquering races weaker than they.  By the third age, 
all the other races who had once flourished on the many large Isles of the 
North Sea had been extinguished or driven into slavery.  The most 
formidable resistance had been put up by the relatively peaceful Psycians, 
people legendary for their psionic abilities.  Eventually, however, the 
Psycian homeland isle crumbled under the heavily populated Frontacian 
forces.  Only those Psycians who had been away from their homelands on 
expeditions remained alive.

  With the world under their control, the Frontacians were free to turn 
towards exploration.  Many groups settled the newly claimed lands and built 
up many large city-states within the empire.  Two such city-states were 
built on the continent presently home to the Spur, north of the Great 
Divide.  The large city-state built at the base of the mountains of the 
Great Divide was named Penthania, the Living Jewel, the city that always 
shined.  The  second group of Frontacians built their civilization along 
the continent's northern coastline.  This became the city-state of Arcania, 
City of Magick.  

  While the Frontacians were busy conquering their known world, the 
Dragons remained apart and enjoyed their relatively peaceful lives.  In 
those days, Dragons didn't have multiple stages as they do today.  The 
young, in a time when they still came from eggs, hatched into smaller 
versions of the adults.  (the Psycians didn't discover the properties of 
dragon essence until much later).

  The peace, however, was short-lived.  The Penthanians quickly learned why 
their neighboring city-state had been named Arcania.  The city itself had 
been built upon a giant vein of crystal and became an awesome nexus of 
magickal energy.  The crystal deposit acted like a conduit and enhanced 
their already powerful magicks.  The Penthanians had been some of the most 
powerful mages of the entire Frontacian Empire, but were now second to the 
might of the Arcanians.  It angered them further that the Arcanians wished 
to leave behind their history of warfare and conquest and chose to use 
their magicks for peaceful purposes.  To the Penthanians, that line of 
thinking was almost alien, and only seen as proof of the weakness of the 
Arcanians.  They believed that no one with such a weakness should be 
allowed to control such powerful magick.

  Thus began the Penthanian War.  The Penthanians struck Arcania forcefully 
and without warning.  The Arcanians, however, were quick to react and used 
their powerful magicks to defend rather than retaliate.  This tactic 
irritated the Penthanians to no end.  They were using their most powerful 
offensive magicks and very seldom did any damage to the city or its people. 
More often than not, their magick had little or no effect.

  Then it happened.  Driven to the point of obsession, the Penthanians 
attempted something never before seen in the world.  They unleashed the  
Unmagick.  For the first time since the rise of the empire a whole age 
before, the mages tried to control something more powerful than they could 
understand, and while they had targeted the Arcanians, every living 
creature within the "Unmagick zone," a very large area, was touched by it.

  Those Arcanians within the city were the first to experience the horrid 
transformation.  They lost their humanoid-Frontacian form and took on an 
Arachnid appearance.  Their once omnivorous teeth became deadly fangs and 
the jewel that once decorated their palms became a spinneret which shot a 
crystalline web.  It wasn't the physical transformation, however, which 
affect them the most.  Instead, when they were hit by the Unmagick, they 
suddenly and violently lost the ability to use or command runes or magick, 
even though their understanding of it remained intact.  For a people who 
ate, slept, breathed, and lived magick, that was the most terrible form of 
rape one could perform.  Unable to cope with the loss, their once orderly 
peaceful minds became a maddened warp of chaos.  They became what we know 
today as the Arachnians.

  The Penthanians, trying to control this unpredictable force, caught the 
backlash of their actions.  The jewels in their hands and foreheads grew, 
slowly overtaking their bodies, insinuating themselves into the very 
bloodstream, completely transforming their flesh into a hard, crystalline 
substance.

  At the same time the Penthanians had been planning their final move, a 
large group of young Arcanians were exploring an uncharted area some 
leagues south of their home city, collecting whatever they could so that it
could be studied and categorized.  This is a point of history that is 
somewhat blurred, the only recount given by an old Dragon who had 
witnessed the change and had it scribed several years later:

  "They were within the bowl, the open sand-bottom portion of the Great Lair 
where the very young Dragons and egg clutches were kept in warmth so the 
mothers could gather while keeping a watchful eye on all the offspring 
together.  No one saw anything at first.  Then suddenly one of the mother 
Dragon's furious bugle cry echoed across the valley.   There were dozens 
of them, scurrying about the warm sands like a swarm of ants.  I had been 
about to char them to the last, when I noticed something that chilled my 
veins...  They carried with them several of our eggs which had soon been 
due to hatch.

  "Before anyone could think to do anything else, a brilliant flash 
engulfed the entire Lair, blinding me completely.  When at last I regained 
my sight, the scene before me burned itself into my mind for all of 
eternity.  Scattered across the sands were hundreds of tiny gems mixed 
with shards of shattered dragons eggs.  I forced myself to take a closer 
look.  There was neither sign of the invaders nor the dragonettes, but 
there were several little creatures, three distinct types, which moved 
across shards and gems alike.  The black, spider-like creatures at the 
edge of the bowl wreathed about in the sands, their appendages clasping 
their heads.  Movement towards the center of the bowl caught my eye.  This 
creature was no longer than one of my claws, and I noticed delicate silver 
wings which curved up from its back.  The creature looked up at me with 
startling ruby-red eyes...eyes filled with tears.  In her minute hands was 
a jewel.

  "Unable to comprehend the significance, the soft keening of one of the 
mother Dragons distracted my attention.  'Those are our babies,' she said. 
I looked back again at the masses of shards and cold fear gripped my 
throat.  Within the center of each mass of shards lay a tiny being.  I 
nearly dismissed the suggestion until I looked into the tiny eyes of one 
of them and felt its faint link.  My heart sank..."

  Those Arcanians who had not been in contact with any of the Dragon eggs 
experienced the same transformation and stripping of magick as did those 
within the city.  The other Arcanians, however, the ones who had been 
holding the eggs at the time the Unmagick hit, were affected, but 
experienced a completely different transformation.  Somehow, they and the 
Dragons within the eggs they carried were interaffected by the Unmagick.  
Among other noticeable changes, those Arcanians gained wings like the 
Dragons had once been born with and a mental link similar to that of the 
Dragons which worked among those like themselves.  The Dragons, in turn, 
assimilated the humanoid life forms which had characterized the Arcanians.  
One theory is that the magick inherent to all dragons combined with that 
of the Arcanians deflected the Unmagick so that they didn't get the full 
effect, but more of a side-effect.  Not one of the Dragon eggs that had not 
been in contact with an Arcanian had survived to hatching, and no Dragon 
afterwards was able to produce a fertile egg.

  At first, the older Dragons tried to shun and deny this new form of 
offspring, but the mothers protected them fiercely.   The new form of 
Arcanians, call Secians or "Jewel-eyed," tried to return to their home in 
the wake of those who had become Arachnians and fled.  They were quickly 
driven out.  The newly transformed Arachnians were filled with such hatred 
for the tiny secians, who could still control the runes, that the tiny 
beings were lucky to escape with their lives.

  Unable to understand the hatred which had overcome their former race, 
they returned almost without hope to the Dragons.  The Dragons, 
remembering that it was because of these people that their young had become 
what they were, also tried to drive the foot-tall beings away.  Some of 
the mothers, however, noticed that these little, child-like people had an 
immediate taking to their own young (some say that a portion of their 
psyche was exchanged with the Dragons in addition to physical characters) 
and were better suited for caring for the delicate young than their own 
massive claws.  After much arguing, the other Dragons finally agreed to 
allow them to stay.  The Secians felt horrible about what had become of 
the world because of the hunger for power and destruction which had overcome
the Penthanians, and vowed to never harm another creature for all of 
eternity.  They also pledged their services to the Dragons as a payment 
for the transformation which they blamed on themselves.

  As the young Dragons grew, they formed close friendships with these little 
Secians.  Just when the older Dragons were about to admit that their 
long-lived race was winding towards extinction, the first of the young 
Dragons began its transition to the second stage*.  The mother, panicked 
by the distress in her son's link, couldn't figure out how to relieve his 
pain.  At a point near death, one of the Secians who had been the dragon's 
closest friend flew in nearly out of control and began healing him.  The 
young Dragon came back from certain death, not only as himself, but 
slightly more Draconian in appearance.  For several days, the Secian 
refused to leave the dragon's side and the dragon, in turn, became 
fiercely protective of the Secian.  Thus formed the first bondmates. The 
same procedure was used when the other dragons began their transformations. 
All but one of the Dragons survived the transition.  These dragons didn't 
blame the Secians for the transformations of their race, but instead, were 
thankful that the Secians were there to aid them in their survival.  In 
gratitude, the new generation of Dragons swore to always be the protectors 
of the "Little Ones."  The Dragons once again had a future.  

  Through the ages, the bonds between Dragons and Secians have become 
legendary.  A Dragon does not have to seek out a Secian to bond with, but 
if they don't, they take the chance of dying permanently or losing their 
sanity.  Even though one chooses to bond, placing themselves and their 
chosen in danger of dying permanently, it is worth the risk.  

  There has not been a failed bonding in over 1000 years.  However, to 
avoid sure death or loss of sanity, all Dragons need to bond.  Most 
Secians who are not already bonded will happily accept.

  I have noticed a question regarding the changing of Secians.  If a 
Chosen has left the realm for some reason and a bond has not yet been 
established, yes the Secian can be changed.  Any unbonded Secian who heals 
a Dragon during the later stages of the Change becomes the bondmate of the 
Dragon.  If the Chosen is not around while the Dragon is in the later 
stages of the Change, the first Secian who comes in to heal the Dragon 
becomes that Dragon's bondmate.  Any other Secian who tries to heal the 
Dragon after the bond has been established may come to great harm.  In 
extremely rare cases, there is a narrow chance that if the bondmate has 
been gone for a long period of time, the bond may weaken to a point where 
a new bond can be established with a new mate.   Keep in mind that only the 
Chosen may heal the staging Dragon otherwise it may cost the lives of both 
the Dragon and the Chosen.  The third party will feel a backlash and may 
come to harm as well.

  The process of staging is a very painful experience for the Dragon.  It 
is because of the Little Ones that the pain is bearable and does not kill 
us or drive us insane.  My Brothers and Sisters, I urge you one and all to 
take care of the Little Ones.  Cause them no harm and protect them from 
others who would bring them harm.


[* Please Note: It wasn't until hundreds of years later, at the advent of 
the Psi wars did the dragons recognize an unexpected advantage in the 
staging process.  It is a well known fact that both the Psycians and the 
Frontacians need special drugs to keep them sane because of a fault in 
their DNA.  Before the Frontacians destroyed the Psycian homeland, the 
Psycians had cultivated a herb that would produce the drug, but that 
herb could be found no where else in the world.  When the Psycian homeland 
was discovered by the Frontacians (it is rumored that the Dragon's were 
the ones who gave away the location of the hidden isle)and subsequently 
destroyed, the herb, too, was forever lost.  The Psycians were forced to 
find a substitute, which they did...dragon essence.  As it turned out, 
dragon essence was virtually useless if it came from a first or second 
stage dragon.  Only the older dragons could produce the essence needed for 
the drug.  Thus, the staging process came to serve as a protection for the 
young dragons until they could readily defend themselves.}

Woven this third day of the Weaver's Moon,
In the year of the Fang Ascendant,
In the fifty third year of our Lady's reign.


Dearest Kkchrrikkttarr,

  I hope this spool will be able to make it to you in a timely fashion.  
I've entrusted it to a courier of some ability, but we both know how 
difficult it can be to navigate the Wastes during the season of storms.  I 
know he'll get it to you eventually, or die trying, but I need your 
assistance with a matter that requires a timely response.  A number of 
spools detailing some interesting historical happenings here in the city 
are in the pouch that arrived, hopefully, with this message.  Please 
concentrate your attention on the matter they discuss and return to me any 
insights that you may have.
  How go your alchemical studies?  Is that bloated old Matron Chrrkattrris 
still nipping your hindparts to study?  I've been away so long that I'd 
even be willing to listen to one of her rambling lectures on actar and 
it's uses just to remind me of what I'm missing.  This accursed place 
purports to have an establishment dealing in alchemical supplies, but the 
dolt running it can't seem to get more than a few weak essences in stock.  
The sheer ignorance regarding matters alchemical is staggering.  Even a 
spiderling fresh from the crèche could distill far more powerful potions 
and brews than the weak teas that pass for wonders here.  I've tried to
cobble together some basic equipment from what's available, but haven't 
had much success.  You were always the better student at such things.
  I despair even more for the state of the food supply here.  The city has 
a delightful variety of fresh meats just walking around, of which I've 
sent you several preserved samples, but the level of true cuisine is 
appalling.  Not one single shop offers foods prepared in the traditional 
ways!  No spicing broth, no flesh wine, no grubs, and not a single 
flensing table to be found.  How do they expect us to eat without 
binding straps and blood runnels on the table?  They're all barbarians, 
Kkchrrikkttarr.  I know my work here is important, but my mouthparts 
water at the thought of the delicious meals I could be enjoying back 
there at the webhold.  If you should ever visit I beg you to bring a 
thorax pouch filled with treats for your old crèche mate.
  Since my arrival here the weather has been abysmal.  At first there was 
just a nip in the air, but now it seems to snow almost every day.  Not 
the crisp, clean snow of home, but a terrible wet slush that falls from 
the sky and clings to everything it touches.  Every afternoon I'm forced 
to clean a gruesome mixture of slush, dirt, and debris from my footpads 
or spend the night hobbling around like an old Matriarch with eggs.  If 
the teachings of the Gods did not say otherwise I would swear this city 
is a slice of the hells made manifest.
  And the smell!  You'd think that even a two-legger would be able to 
practice the most basic measures of hygiene, especially considering that 
foul liquid that oozes from their skins.  The least bit of exertion seems 
to cover them with an odorous film of the stuff, but do they bathe?  Never!
At best they'll pour some water over themselves.  I've endeavored to teach 
a few of the inhabitants here how to take a proper sand bath like civilized 
beings, but I labor in vain.  I won't even attempt to describe the musky 
odor of wet fur that wafts from certain sections of the city. 
  Speaking of which, has there been word there of a new civil war amongst 
the Khat kin?  Rumors abound here of some kind of conflict going on in the 
hinterlands of that wretched rock of an island they call home.  It would 
make sense considering the number of refugees that seem to have settled 
here in the Spur.  The damnable beasts are everywhere, running through 
the streets like a herd of rutting muck crawlers.
  There was a bit of excitement a few weeks ago when the dull-witted twit 
that passes for their ruler arrived.  He claimed to be visiting in order 
to recognize the establishment of a Pride here, but considering the stories 
floating around I think it's no coincidence he chose to leave the isle at 
the same time a war was brewing.  Could you contact one of the Matriarch's 
servitors and find out what the situation is?  I'd be most appreciative of 
any information you could pass along to me.  
  For about a week after the establishment ceremony the khatkin seemed 
reasonably organized, but then they broke up into factions once again. 
I expect that we won't have to worry about them all that much.  It should 
be simple to manipulate that inane code of honor in order to make them 
impotent at the time it matters most.  It's amusing how easy it is to bait 
them a bit and then watch as they become helplessly entangled in a trap 
they never saw or even knew existed.
  In terms of real power very few of the khatkin are a threat to our plans.
Their magical abilities are amateurish and totally ineffective against our 
resistance, their weapon skills are useless against the heavy armor we 
favor, and they have the discipline of a gang of kittens.  I think publicly 
killing a few until they're permanently crippled should insure their 
obedience.   To guarantee that my information regarding their capabilities 
remains current I've retained several servitors.  Besides the usual 
complement of Psycians I've been lucky enough to locate several disgraced 
khatkin eager for revenge against their kind.  Between the two groups I 
expect few if any facts to slip free of my grasp. 
  The one group I think we may encounter problems with are the dragons.  
At this point a council has been established to help manage their affairs 
with the other races of the Spur.  Not every dragon has sworn allegiance 
to it, but there is a core group of older dragons that does interest me.  
They have a respectable amount of magical and martial ability, but it's 
the level of cooperation present that may prove troublesome.  They spend a 
great deal of time with one another and have developed several useful group 
fighting techniques.
  I will continue to observe their tactics, but I believe we can counter
many of their strengths and play upon their one great weakness.  Beating 
them will be difficult because of the synergy formed by their duel 
abilities in both runecraft and bladework.  Conversely, few of them can be 
said to truly excel at either craft.  Since they're dependent on runes to 
enhance their fighting capability, and the group support that approach 
provides, breaking up any battle groups they form should be a top priority.
If we can spread them out and web them down in the vulnerable period right
after they invoke runes it shouldn't take much time at all to break their 
cohesiveness.  Individually they aren't much more powerful than the 
khatkin, so keeping the battle group from re-forming will go far towards 
assuring us of victory.
  The greatest asset available to us in any conflict with the dragons is 
their reliance on an artifact in the form of a silver dragon's tooth.  At 
this time it is entrusted to one called Michael, a close confidant of the 
council leader Acinonyx.  If we can gain possession of it the mere threat 
of it's destruction may be enough to neutralize any threat the dragons 
present.  I suspect that they would much rather submit than risk permanent 
injury.  How different from the dragons of old, eh?  But not really 
surprising when you consider how inbred the entire species is.
  Which brings me to the most serious threat before us.  Two Imperial 
dragons have visited the city of late and I suspect that they have lairs 
nearby.  When our plans come to fruition I would expect them to take a dim 
view of our actions against their younger kin.  Considering the raw power 
they possess I do have some concerns as to how we should handle the 
inevitable retaliation to our actions.  If you could speak with the elder 
weavers of the Alchema and find out what techniques were used to hunt 
dragons in the old times I would be most appreciative.  Perhaps the news 
that there is a supply of fresh dragon parts just waiting to be harvested 
will be enough to stir up the ancient Matriarchs from their slumber.  If 
that should happen I look forward to seeing the resulting battle.
  While it may be some time before I finally see you in the flesh I want 
you to know that your efforts are appreciated.  If the Gods smile upon us 
it should be just a matter of time before we establish a proper webhold 
here in the city.  When that happens I hope we can celebrate with a feast 
that would put Ttizzarchkichrr's last debauch to shame.  Till then I am, 
as always, in your service.

                       A  Fighter's Skills 

  Hello, all. Though many of you may not care for me much, I know much 
about surviving in the spur and it's surrounding areas.  This article is 
centered towards fighters, barbarians, sword clerics, and Dragon's.  Today 
I will discuss many of the skills useful in hand-to-hand combat.  However, I 
will first discuss the various merits and drawbacks of the different 
armours and weapon types.
  
  There are four basic types of weapons in Dragon's Gate -- Sharp, 
Blunt, Pole and Missile. It's fairly easy to tell which is which from 
name alone; but even the more-exotic looking weapons one occasionally 
sees, such as the black steel whips favoured by some outland Assassins, 
actually operate as one of these four types.  You may also occasionaly see 
what at first appears to be a weapon but is actually a shield. (No, i'm not 
referring to the glitch that caused certain items to change to other 
things.)

   Each kind of Sharp, Blunt, and Pole weapon is available in light, 
medium, and heavy sizes, with the appearance varying by the specific type 
of weapon. To a large extent, weapons in Dragon's Gate operate as one 
would expect from experience in the "real" world. Within each weapon 
type, and to some degree between types, heavier weapons generally do 
more damage per hit than lighter ones, but are more difficult to wield, 
because they are heavier and clumsier... so they require greater 
strength, dexterity and skill for one to hit with them on a regular basis.

  Aside from roleplaying considerations, each type has beneficial 
applications. If you want a faster kill because you're out to make quick 
money, or because you're dealing with something that is highly dangerous 
compared to the amount of uses it gives, like living slimes, a heavier 
weapon may be best, but only if you can hit with it consistently. For 
getting uses from a target that isn't likely to kill you, a lighter weapon 
may be best, since dead things don't give uses.  I prefer a bastard-sword 
for money and a Sabre, Battle-Axe or even a light dagger for uses.  
(However, I've a tendency to kill most things in a few swings anyhow. 
Believe it or not, high damage stat can be a disadvantage, when trying to 
get uses.)

  In general, I, and most other spurians, prefer useing SHARP WEAPONS, and 
they are the best choice for the majority of adventurers. Advantages are 
that they will inflict more damage for their size and weight than other 
types and are available in a good variety of styles. They also cause slash 
wounds, which can bleed and therefore considerably hasten a target's demise. 

  Another minor advantage is that all but the shortest of Sharp weapons 
(short swords and less) allow fighting with the DECAP command, which, with 
Muatan-al no longer available for use, is basically only good for 
entertainment value {:-].  However, it adds a 2 second delay to your 
attack, which doesn't seem like much at first, but if you miss that 
ancient yelican coming at you....

  Types of Sharp Weapons generally available, in ascending order of 
their weight and damage, are daggers, axes, rapiers, sabers, scimitars 
and swords. Some of these have special uses; and there is 
an on-going controversy among professional fighters about the relative 
merits and power of swords and scimitars, which I'll chat about in 
a subsequent column.

  The major disadvantage of Sharp weapons is economical. They seem to 
break more than other hand weapons, and they aren't too cheap, but nothing 
is.  It's not only for economic reasons that sharp weapons can be bad, 
however.  Life and death is a much more important reason for going with 
another weapon type (Broken sword+angry Marsh reaper=dead adventurer).  If 
you carry a back up, though, and take good care of your sword, you shouldn't
have a problem.

   The major advantage of BLUNT weapons is the economic reverse of Sharp. 
Even low-level NPC's, such as rogues, carry all good types of Blunt 
weapons, with the exception of mauls, far and away the best blunt.  They 
break less, for almost obvious reasons, but they weigh a bit more.
   
	The major disadvantage (and this is a BIG one) of Blunt weapons is 
that, except for the heaviest of them, wielded by very strong people, they 
do less damage than a sharp weapon of equivalent size and difficulty. In 
ascending order of weight and damage, the commonly used types are 
one-hand hammers, one-hand maces, two-hand maces, two-hand hammers and 
two-hand mauls. A fair number of mages and clerics also use two-hand 
quarter-staves, which can do good damage. Clubs and Flails are also 
available, but are less popular, as they are thought to do less damage for 
their weight than other types.

   Unless you are a Thugian, Oog-ra, monitanian, or maybe a dragon, the 
only reason you would want to use blunt that I can think of is for 
roleplaying reasons.  Heart clerics are required by their vows never to 
spill blood, but bruises are fine, thus they can use blunts weapons.
One other disadvantage of blunt weapons is, as I said before, they don't   
"bleed" like sharps do, so they don't continue to do damage. The abrasions 
they leave may do a little damage, but not like gaping wounds.  One other 
thing I would like to mention about blunt weapons is that they sell good, 
especially the brass hammers and bronze flails that go for about 900 silver 
each in the curio shop at the merchant circle.
  
    POLE weapons are long weapons, available as lances or pikes, 
with pikes being more powerful in general and doing more damage. They are 
the heaviest and most difficult to wield of the hand weapons, but used by 
one of skill, they can do extremely large amounts of damage. Aside from 
that, the major advantage of these is that their length allows the wielder 
to fight from a retreated position. If a Pole-wielder uses a tactic 
(hit and run!) of alternating retreats with strikes, they can more safely 
engage stronger adversaries with less chance of being hit themselves, even 
if the adversary chases them.(Editor's note: As of this time, Pole users 
are not yet able to attack from a different rank then their target. This 
may be changed though as time goes by.)
 
   A disadvantage of Pole weaponry is that, while advancement in skill 
can dramatically increase the damage you do, they are generally expensive, 
and as said before, hard to wield.  This may, however, be a small price to 
pay for the safety they provide, and the massive damage they can produce.

   The major advantage of MISSILE weapons is that they can be used from
a great distance, and are excellent weapons for flying races, such as 
secians or anthians. They are also useful for others who may be too 
physically weak to engage in direct face-to-face combat, allowing them to 
attack from a distance with less risk of coming into contact with an enemies 
blade.  A skilled Missile-user can cause damage well out of proportion to 
his physical strength. Crossbows generally do more damage than plain bows.  
 
  An offsetting disadvantage is that an archer or crossbowman who does 
get caught in face-to-face combat is effectively weaponless. Missile 
weapons also take two rounds to complete an attack -- one to nock an 
arrow or load a bolt, and one to fire.  
 
  Finally, a brief word on SHIELD PARRY. Uses can be extremely hard to 
get in the lower levels, but you should see at least a few over the course 
of an hour of play. NPC's have a "switch" that has to be turned on before 
they will hit your shield and give any uses at all -- they have to be 
physically attacked first. They don't have to be hit, but they do have 
to be attacked. Sometimes, the "switch" can reset to off in a number of
different ways; so, if your shield hits seem to stop, it's always a good 
idea to make an attack.  Note: I believe they may also have to be attacked 
with a weapon, or maybe claws or teeth, martial arts may not work.
 

  The best opponents to take on for shield uses are anything that can't kill 
you.  Critters around your level of expertise are especially good, because 
they are less likely to get through, but will still give uses.  Experiment 
and find what is right for you.


                  Armour

  This section ought to be shorter than the one on weapons.  Here I will 
discuss the difference in armour materials, styles, and sizes (to this day 
it shocks me that a thugian could wear a secians armour).


  There are 3 different styles of armour.  They are, in ascending order of 
weight and protection, cloaks, tunics, armour, and mail.  Each is suited 
better than another, in most cases, for particular races and classes.  Try 
to find one that isn't too heavy, but gives adequate protection for what 
you need.

 The lightest and weakest style if armour is a cloak.  These are really only 
suited for secian and newbies that won't be fighting anything stronger than 
rogues.  Obviously, a drathain cloak isn't that weak, but you get the 
picture.  Some mages use them, mostly because of the classical "look" of  
a wizard wearing a cloak and holding an oak wand.  You should generally 
stay away from these unless you know what your doing or you sincerly like 
dying.  

  The next type or armour is the tunic.  This is basically just a shirt, 
although it covers your entire body.  Once again, these are really only 
suited for fliers who won't get hit much, or can only carry a little bit.

   Our next style of armour is....ARMOR!  this is your basic middle-age 
like plate armour that protects relatively well.  If you can, a beginner 
might want to try getting light or heavy leather armor.  It protects well, 
and is inexpensive.  Once you get to armour though, you can start having 
problems if you aren't eating your wheaties, or at least reduxa-weight.  
Most of us won't have any problem yet.  If you'll notice I keep referring 
to secians and anthians.  About here I can start adding elves to the list, 
Usil and Fir that is, not san. Possibly Flerians.  

   Enough kiddie halloween stuff though... onto (drumroll) MAIL!  This is 
the hot stuff.  Although it's the heaviest, it protects superbly.  It costs 
a good deal more than other styles, but it's worth it.  If you want 
something to last a LONG time, and protect your life, go with mail.  

  Now I would like to get onto armour materials.  I couldn't name tham all, 
there's about 150 of them, but I can give you some average prices for the 
good materials.

   Leather: it's better than you think. Although it's not the best, it can 
take a beating and protects relatively well.  It's also not too heavy, even 
when made into giant mail. Of course, many Khats swear by Leather and 
refuse to wear anything heavier. They seem to think it is better to dodge
away from a strike than to have it clang off a giant Steel shell which 
surrounds them as though they were a turtle.

Steel: Use your common sense. Steel is steel.  One important thing to 
mention though, metals and magick are a no no.  Wearing metal armour and 
trying to cast a spell is a bad idea.  A giant steel mail will run you 
somewhere around 8000 silver, and will stop a rogue, skeleton, townie, and 
in general any low level vermin's attack.  It has a good tolerance, and 
won't break easily.  Besides the magick disadvantage, some styles may be 
restricting and stop some martial arts moves

Quartz: One word- Excellent.  It gives great protection, is non-metallic,
so it won't interfere with spells, and doesn't "bind" as steel might.  Now 
for it's downside.  It doesn't resist breakage extremely well.  It is also 
heavy. My giant quartz mail weighs 165 pounds.  It does cost less than 
steel though, running at about 6250 for a giant mail.


  In addition to these "general protection" styles, there are Gauntlets, 
boots, helms, and shields.  Gauntlets and boots give added protection to 
your legs and feet, while helms, obviously, protect your head.  They also 
come in light, heavy, and giant, and are available in all materials.

                              Skills

   Now I will talk about some of the skills the fighting classes may find 
most helpful.  I've already talked about weapons and shield parry, so i'll 
skip those.  I wil talk about skills like disarming, quickdraw, and berserk 
attack.  

Disarming:  An effective way of relieving someone or something of their 
weapon.  Stat's affecting this skill are strength and dexterity, both in 
using it and defending against it.  When disarmed, the weapon falls to the 
ground.  Monsters have the ability to get the weapon and ready it again. 
The act of disarming, regardless of whether you succeed or fail, places a 5 
second delay on you.

Berzerk: Not yet in use, will allow extra force to be added to a blow, all 
barbarians start with this.

Dodging: Not yet in use. This skill will grant a greater bonus to your 
defense, and make it more likely that you are able to dodge out of the way
of an opponents blow.

Focus force:  Allows you to add a large amount of damage to an attack, but 
places a HUGE delay on you.  The delay can easily be counteracted, however, 
when used by one of high level weapons.  The hit may be so powerful a 
second won't be needed.  If you miss, you have about 23 seconds of delay.  
Use commands: focus on and focus off.(Editor's note: The delay is not 
standard, and in my opinion may be a function of Strength and Dexterity. No
Tests have been done to prove this though. Delay will not be 23 seconds for 
all players though. -Rags)

Quickdraw: decreases RT on attacks and drawing your weapon.

  Final note on weapons and armour:  To get item special made go to the 
Artificers Guild. It is in the Guild area to the North of Town Square.
From the gate go n, sw, w, and nw. Then buy. To get to the fighters guild 
to train, go from the guild gate n, ne, e, and north. Then TRAIN.
     
  That's about it for now.  I would like to give SPECIAL thanks to Pyanfar  
Chanur, someone most of you will never know.  In the old Spur she wrote a 
document similar to this from which I got much of the weapons information 
and info on shield parry.

                           Letters to the Editor


Psionic Telepathy:  Joy or Curse?              

  Greetings, and warnings, to my fellow Psycians.  As you may already be
aware, our profound telepathic abilities can be a double-edged sword.  
Reaching out and connecting is truly exhilirating.  But those mind messages 
also annoy and invade the privacy of others.
  Trust me, when a band of Psycians fling messages back and forth across the 
void, annoyance is the mildest word used by some.  Many Spurians have sought 
my aid in seeking a reprieve from mind assault by my fellow Psycians.  I too
felt the chagrin of uninvited psionic thoughts recently, when every word 
attempted between my fellow adventurers and I was instantly cut off by 
another telepathic intrusion.  It opened my eyes to the hostility and sheer 
frustration experienced by other races.
  We have the ability to contact each other individually.  No need for mass 
communication.  No need to interrupt someone else's intricate battle 
strategy.  No need to butt into private conversations from a great 
distance.  And definitely no need to die by strangulation because of your 
talents.
  As responsible Spurian citizens,  let's keep in mind that telepathy is a 
profound gift to be harnessed, not a toy to be trivialized.  Allow fellow 
Spurians to admire our power and respect our refined skill.  It may be used 
to their benefit one day, but not if they kill you first.

                                               Allandra Shadowfax

============================================================================


	
  I have traveled around the Spur now fer a couple of months enjoying the 
rich trade and wholesome adventure that is stored within.  But, the one 
thing I enjoy the most about the Spurian community is the large joke that 
nobody seems to notice.  That being the lack of...pants.
  Now being a Hithual, I do so enjoy the comedy of the situation.  But even 
we short races, who could wear long tunics as cover, find it a bit breezy on 
those clouded over winter nights.  Perhaps it was a Drag-al, whom I am never 
seen as needing these lower garments, who started this comical prank.  Or it 
could be the Go-blins that have prevented good breach merchants from 
entering the city.  There again it could be...Well, whomever it was must 
have spent the last months cornering the market on cloth to dry the tears 
of humor from their laugh-wrinkeled eyes.
  I fer one would enjoying seeing a merchant start business within the Spur 
that dealt in these and other fine garments.  There would be a great market 
fer this and some knowledgable and shrewd tailor could become a very 
wealthy person in a very short time, I think.
	
	Thank you from a very chilly and concerned citizen,
		Exyx Worldview

				HeartStone Songs

I hear the soft cries,
drawing, pulling me onward
To quiet them, to end them
Go I.

The forest stands around me
Tall, dark shapes of ages long past
What worlds they have seen,
Only Elindale knows.

I love the life of the forest
Desire to stay, to listen, do I
I could rest here forever,
Listening.

I cannot stay now
Cannot stay and with the forest converse
Onward, onward I am drawn,
Onward

From far away I hear them,
The pain itself does draw me on
Healing, it seems, is not what I do
Healing I am

At last I am here
The source of the cries lies before me
Loud voices, friends and companions
Demand

Quickly I work
The weaving of life is well known to me
And I quiet the cries by instinct and love
Quietly

Many thanks I receive
Joy and hope to these have I brought
And to myself, for a brief moment
Peace

For a moment I rest
A brief moment only, though I want more
Only a moment, for much pain remains
Endless

I hear the soft cries,
drawing, pulling me onward
To quiet them, to end them
Go I.

Pluck the Strings

There is a time, in the dead of the Night,
When I hunger for break of the Dawn.
When the road seems too rough, and my faith seems too thin,
So I staunch all my pain with a song.

So I sit and pluck the strings. 
So I sit and pluck the strings.

There is a time when my purse is too light,
And my cloak is all tattered and torn.
When the way seems too hard, and the monsters too strong,
So I staunch all my pain with a song.

So I sit and pluck the strings. 
So I sit and pluck the strings.

There is a time when my sword is to heavy,
My steps much too slow to keep up.
When the rain is too cold, my boots full of water,
So I staunch all my pain with a song.

So I sit and pluck the strings. 
So I sit and pluck the strings.

There is a time when the Dawn seems to reach me,
When the light warms my face and my hands.
When the way is clear and smooth, when my faith proves itself,
So I greet the warm light with a song.

So I sit and pluck the strings. 
So I sit and pluck the strings.

There is a time when my life seems just perfect,
When the soft wind's a kiss on my cheek.
When the world lays itself like an op'n book before me,
So I greet the warm light with a song.

So I sit and pluck the strings. 
So I sit and pluck the strings.

  Well, this issue we decided to leave in the relative rankings, so we could
see who is the most powerful, and by how much. We also decided to give the
full top 10 list of each guild, at the insisting of a certain Secian who 
shall remain nameless. A great deal of change occured this issue, with 
5 of the 8 Guilds having traded in one master for another. The Spur seems
to be under new leadership, as new blood rushes in to supplant the ones
who have grown complacent at the top.
  Congratulations to Saltine Cracker on achieving the top rank of the Sword 
Clerics. Congratulations are also in oprder for Gristle Bonebreaker on 
supplanting Ragarn Lazlo as the top Runeweaver. Set only knows that Ragarn 
needed to have his ego dropped a few pegs. Leriet was also able to pass 
the ever present Dragonfly in the Clerics guild, while relative newcomer
Worf has risen swiftly to take over the Barbarians guild. Lastly, complete
newcomer netra  dennda has risen to dominate the Fighters Guild. After a bit
of investigation though, this reporter was unable to find anyone who could 
claim to have seen this Leuian in the fur.

                              Rumors

(Editor's note: These are all various rumors that have found their way to 
                DFC HQ one way or another. The DFC makes no claim that 
                any of these are in fact true. We simply report them 
                here, and leave it to our readers to decide on their 
                validity themselves. -Rags)

-For those of you who have been living underground, it seems that the being
formerly known as Soros has returned to once again torment the Spur. 
Whether he will be able to gain his objectives this time around remains to 
be seen.

-In a related story, it seems that many of the members of the church of 
Taath have thrown in with this would be God. Some were seen in the TS lately
doing their best to try to protect Soros from the other inhabitants of the 
Spur. They were reported to have claimed, "You will all be sorry when the 
master comes, he will destroy you all." Is Taath involved with Soros? 
Enquiring minds want to know.

-In a completely unrelated story, Soros was seen rounding up sheep in the 
farms to the South of the city. One can only speculate on the fate of these
poor creatures. 

-The Master Hand Cleric known as Lorelei seems to be having conflicting 
loyalties lately. Seems she may have accidentaly declared for SA, without 
informing Taath of this switch in allegiance. Taath seems to be miffed with 
his #1 Enforcer, even going so far as to deny her the power to ressurect 
when she prays to him. So Lorelei, who's it gonna be? Taath or SA. 
Enquiring minds want to know.

-Dragons seem to be having trouble lately. After a desperate battle with 
several minions of Taath, they were forced to retreat, and their leader 
taken prisoner by Soros himself. It seems that Soros wanted the leader of 
the Dragon Council, Acinonyx, to take the place of his sheep. Fortunately,
Acinonyx was able to withstand the temptation, and eventually win her way
free. It seems Soros will have to content himself with another lamb warming
his bedside tonight.

-Scandal in the Gladitorial games....In the most recent of the Governor's
Games, many of the participants were shocked to learn that they would be 
fighting their last battle completely in the buff. Before hundreds of 
jeering spectators the Gladiators were forced to strip, all for a few 
measly coins. Several of the Gladiators received appreciative catcalls, 
with Mercelle the Psycian commanding a large following. Several Dragons
in the stands were also heard to comment appreciatevly on the Golden shine 
of Acinonyx's shinning scales. Not to be undone, several Thuggian women
almost started a riot when they saw Grunt, the brother of Gristle 
Bonebreaker, take the field. With record attendance for this event though, 
it is assumed that the Elders will continue to pander to the lustful 
nature of the crowd, and order more of these games in the future.
