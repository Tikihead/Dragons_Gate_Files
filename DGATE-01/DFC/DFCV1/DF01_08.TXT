Greetings Citizens of the Spur, it is I, your Editor in Chief with my humble little commentary/editorial. This issue, as you will notice, has returned to it's normal format, minus the Gossip column ::glances at the appropriate guilty parties involved:: and it covers a wide spectrum of content, with stirring interviews, proof that Thugians can actually write, let alone read, and stirring Bardic entries. Over the past month, we have seen unrest grow from spreading rumors, only boding a dark cloud for some. So, perhaps this is the last time I will be able to say something on the matter. Only time will tell what future holds for each of us, so with a stiff chin, stay strong in your resolve. There are effective ways to let your voice become known, but it's rather unfair for it to cross over into the Spur. It takes a certain amount of composure to keep one's dignity, so let's give it a whirl, what say? Now that I got that out of the way, I can continue with my standard long-winded-ness you all have come to love. I feel I should let those that are curious know, concerning my status in the Spur. Some have heard that I have outright quit and departed from the lands, and to you all, my friends, I am not leaving. I am, when I can and my duties to the DFC are not calling, sleeping most of the time. It seems we Dragons get sleepy when our time comes to stage. Perhaps I'm storing up even more fat in my rotund belly, to ready myself when I sprout wings on my back, or my forehead, I forget. Just kidding. So what's going on in Spur nowadays, you may wonder? Well, proudly, the Dragons have formed a Council. Sadly, Paratwa, the Khatyr is gone missing, but I'm sure he'll be back, like a plague. Sadly I stubbed my toe. Cheers to the Hithual's, and getting their group going. ( I won't butcher the name and offend someone, so you all hopefully know what I'm referring to.) Bigger cheers to them if they send some beer my way. ::shameless hint, pokes Kraggon:: Let's see, congratulations to the many couples that were wed throughout the Spur. I think that about covers it all. I'm not used to doing this yet, so perhaps I'm just babbling, so, I'll leave off with this, and now I can get back to sleep. Remember, keep those stories and whatnot flowing to me, so we can have yet another fine DFC for you all next month.

Cheers,
Michael

The Official Oog-ra Cookbook
Volume 1
by
Tarth Ottaba, Oog-ra Chef extrodonaire

Scripted by Nintorintal Greatinfore
Usil Scribe

Throughout my years of scribing and examining different races and religions of spur I have made some insignificant discoveries. My kind is sent forth to obtain knowledge, and share it with the rest of my peers, and I have done so for many years. As my time grows thin, and my age surpasses my ability to travel the lands, my experiences are vital, because they are so few now. The most known people of my race have been awarded with great riches for finding such lost relics and mystical scrolls that would change the known world. I myself have never reached that status, nor will I ever. I have never really done anything spectacular, nor will I ever. I have never been recognized for my work, nor will I ever. I have been a poor miserable soul that has been ridiculed by my race for my excessive failure.

My latest discovery will show my race I am not the failure they think I am, but a genius in my own right. Through years and years of searching the great tundra of the northern mountains, I stumbled upon a horde of people from the Oog-ra race. I had never seen so many of their kind in one place, and was astonished by them. I conversed with these beasts for many days and studied their bizarre culture. They ate excessively, anything they could find, even rocks, anything. At one time I though my own life was in danger as one Oog-ra seemed as though he had me in mind for a meal, but that soon passed. After 9 sunsets, the cold was to great for me, so I brought my diary back with me to the great city of Uitabal to show my peers of my discovery.

Needless to say, they weren't impressed, they hardly cared about any one Oog-ra never mind a whole clan of them, so after a couple more days, I ventured back to the camp of beasts.

Much to my surprise...the camp had been raided and destroyed. Everywhere, these innocent beasts had been slain and pillaged. Oog-ra bodies littered the area and there was no sign of life. I stood over one of the slain corpses and a single tear strolled down my face and fell upon the beasts chest, as the tear hit, one massive Oog-ra stepped out of the shadows and introduced himself. 

He told me of the massive war that had occurred between his race and the massive Thugian Armies who were out to eliminate his kind forever. He told me amazing stories of battle and how his people fought valiantly, but failed. We talked for hours of his race and told me that he would bury his friends, and make his way to the great city of Spur to start his life anew. With that he handed me this book of ancient Oog-ra recipes, and strode off to begin his life in the grand city of Spur

You all are aware of Tisha's present state..being of penthanian form here is a bit of what has been happening. After she was possesed..and changes..part that I was not around for...I became her chosen somewhat recently, she was told through a magick tome to assemble 8 of the true blood.

Eight penthanians, still wonder if they have blood, gathered and began a quest to look for 8 shards. The information we were getting was being read from a magical tome Tisha was given by Asherak...(apparently an ancient penthanian of the time of un-magick and the defeat of the arachnains long ago, that is a guess as of right now but he has immense power.) I am certain he chose Tisha for her great magick abilities. So reading his tome to us, (it has his name inscribed on it), through Tisha we slowly learned what we had to do. Tisha, her foster father Skratchnar, Sordum, Berial, Pepperi, the 8 penthanians, Silouette, Rockheart, Rokken, Runedrawer, Gunthat, Naimh, Noonan, Kasim, and Berem, ok that's 9 we lost and found one or two as necessary, were the questing party.

As the group was assembled in the mage guild the tome opened and we were set about the task of finding 8 shards...based on clues read to us on various pages of the tome..the highest being in the 3000. The FIRST shard was in the very depths of the Tanga jungle..most of the penthanians are still very young and the whole lot worked well together, none happened to die..through revenants..spiders etc. ..the subsequent 7 shards were all over the spur..s.lands, the HH, Guardian Island...I had the distinct honor of leading the group.

Each of the penthanians had been given a magical tattoo with a gem color...when the shards were found that penthanian picked up the shard and i guess 'melded' with it in a glowing light..they felt stronger and some claimed channeling increases. A few of the shards were held by Tisha till the appropriate pent was able to return from poofville.

Upon finding all the shards we were given clues leading us back to Tanga and over a new sapphire bridge...one I had never seen before...The penthanians joined together in an octagon and the tome opened...with resounding powerful words Tisha/Asherak invoked a spell calling forth a massive crystaline tower with gargoyles on top and no entrance. The shards had been used in the making of the tower long ago. And Asherak need them in his out of body state to recall the tower from time past. With this the group was let to rest for the night and day...my legs and body were sore from pushing through groups of most all the various monsters in the lands to get the team where it was going..I slept well.

Soon thereafter with the group again at the tower in the Eastlands...several trips were necessary, not all had vissed the tower the first time or vissed over their initial spot not knowing about multiple visuals.. The group made their way to the governor's mansion and found a small flask..which initially to all our horror was needed to be filled with dragon blood, of an ancient dragon...there was much commotion in the group especially Tisha who refused to bleed any dragon. Skratchnar suggested we go to meetpoint and talk. There we decided that Myself and Tisha alone would seek out Thiarin's and ask for his blood. Some thought that blood was the same as essence, which is not true..Appealing to Thiarin'as dragonly nature we spoke with him and defined the situation..he gave no hesitation as the flask grew a magical pointed spout and Tisha not without a shiver and shake stuck Thiarin'a and bled him for a small amount of his blood filling the flask...She was very brave in doing so and she honored him with being brave as he let us take some of his life blood.. Returning to the group many were overjoyed at our success i was equally as pleased..that we have such a gracious imperial, that he was there and willing to aid Tisha.

That is where we stand now....the rest has yet to unfold, but I am optimistic, Asherak SEEMs to be an good penthanian (they are entropic by nature) and has don't little harm to anyone..and no direct harm without warning. I was killed by the tome when I readied it early on...but it had warned us only the one could carry it.

Blood on the open field.

Bye: Pagaine Souleater.

Day 6:  It has been six days since my exile of the cursed village of the dead... I wonder aimlessly through fields, searching for any type of shelter during the night.  Sometimes I'll find a roving group of humans to feed me,but I take precautions of hiding my gem atop my forehead.  At night we discussed the lands, and one human brought up a interesting topic.
"War," he grunted, between bites of a mutton. "War over east... between those big Thugs... heard they fightin' the hairy Oog's and those little twerps, the Fleriens."
I found this very interesting... being a mage and a scholar, I packed up the next day and headed east.

Day 7:  After a long walk, I reached a giant camp.  Massive in size, with maybe eight hundred Oog'ra's brandishing their blades, and two hundred Flerians making themselves busy in other peoples belongings.  One flerian was unlucky enough to be caught stealing a dagger, and had his arm cut off from the very same blade.  Amongst the taller Oog's was a massive, hairy one, munching on a pie, and batting away another Flerian carrying a massive umbrella trying to warn him about the effects of overeating... this was definatly a strange bunch.

Day 8: After walking past the tents, I came into a large open field... this made me wonder why in Sa's name the Oog-ra's would pitch up here, with no enemy in sight, when I saw it.  A massive boulder, over two-hundred feet in hieght, and miles across... with all sorts of lookout towers jutting out here and there.  It was truly a marvel.  Upon closer inspection, I discovered an entrace, through a crack around the back of it.  Sliding through I nearly landed in the middle of a Smith's pot.  Yelling and screaming the blacksmith reached for a cudgel around his waist... but of course a fire mace stopped him in his tracks.  I walked out through a door with confidence, I never met a Thug, but they were dumb for their size... I could easily use that to my advantage.  Outside the door came a giant Thugian female, who grabbed me by the neck, lifted me... my world went black.

Day 9:  When I awoke, I found myself in a throne room.  Obviousily of Hithual make, I ‘oohed' and ‘aahed' at the statues lining the walls.  Each one was of a former king or queen, dressed majestically in battle armor, and crown... the first a massive one named "Thump" who had in his hand a giant club, and ant head.  A grunt interrupted my thought, as I turned around to see the king of this subterreanian villiage himself, Thwack Buckhanna.  At his side was a massive, stocky-built Thugian, with chisled looks and a eyepatch that shone through the shadows around him.  His clothes were mostly green, except for the eyepatch and the gloves around his hands... I noticed something on those gloves, a mark of some sort that I could not depict.  At the other side of the king was a shorter form of the first Thugian... a massive five-foot blade hung loosely at his side, while a glittering mail covered a muscular frame.  He sneered at me from head to foot... then stood straight like his counterpart.  Thwack himself was a... full figured man, sitting atop a transparent throne, that seemed to shift constantly... with a clean shaven head, the mark of Taath stood out greatly on his skull. 

"Frontie..."  The Thugian rumbled, "You kilt prize smith... give Thwack reason let live."
I rammered for a moment, uncertain of my next move... without thinking I shot out my hand, a fire dart racing toward the head Thugian's heart.  What happened next appeared a blur, the taller Thugian reached a hand out from beneath a faded cloak, and pointed toward his king.  A blue shield rippled about Thwack, and my spell danced off, shooting upwards before disappearing.  A Thugian MAGE?!  The mark on his gloves shone brightly, on one arm there was the mark of Sa, on the other, the dark vulture of Taath, and the rune of a plague burning through.  The shorter Thugian leaped forward, snarling a war cry of "Buckhanna!" before the hilt of his blade sent me sprawling to the floor.  I knew it was over for me... so I did the best I could with the last ounce of strength to cast a fire storm, and send my killers to Taath himself.  A small delicate hand touched my head, and I felt the pain dissapear...  looking up at the smiling face of a Secian and a Flerian, I dropped me head back, and rolled my eyes back into my head.

"Balinor! What's the matter with you?!" The flerian shrieked and began to hit the Mage on the head with a massive umbrella.  The Thugian mage, scowled and sat back, as the shorter Thugian received a fair beating of his own from the small female Secian.  

"I-I-I-I-I didn't mean to Minnie! I swear!" The short one pleaded, as a stuffed animal hit him upside the head from the Flerian.  The taller mage whirled around, and sent a Fear web on his counterpart, sending him running out the room, dragging the Secian along.
"You tried ta kill Faddur?" Balinor asked. "Why you so dumb?  Ya wanna git plagued up real nice?"

I stuttered a little, and tried to think... "Smite!" the thought raced through my mind, as I called out pointed at the mage.  Flying backwards into a tapestry, the Thug fell... as a red aura shot out from no where into my lungs.  I felt my limbs turn to putty, as I saw a female Thugian tower over me... her head shining like a mirror itself...

Day 10:  I came to in a dreary cell, cold food of Flerian meat lay beside me. Shaking my head, I recollected my spells and my numb head.  

"Oh Taath they plagued me..." I groaned, before a deep click echoed through my cell.

"Ch...." The Flerians voice was cut off by a quick motion of my hand.  Dragging the sleeping body to a corner I prayed for sanctuary, and stalked off.

The hallways in the fortress twisted and turned, zig-zagging every way imaginable.  After awhile I entered the city of Buckhannia... Thugians of all shapes and sizes, most tall, most huge in size, but also the occasional fat one, walked in all directions.  Some of them seemed to look directly at me, but shrugged and continued on.  Finally I approaced a gigantic hut I figured as Thwack's home.  Climbing in stealthily through a window, I turned to the sound of humming.  A aging Female Thugian of perhaps 7'4" hung over a basin, plucking a chicken.  Her head raised for a moment, then lowered again, continuing on with her humming.  In the other room the Thugian mage, and Thwack himself were getting into a heated discussion.  The shorter Thugian with the massive blade sat down on a severed Oilaphant foot stool, and watched the Mage and king argue.

"First Balinor come home, an bring Secian.... even FLERIAN! Den Frontie come home and make early death for Thwack!"

The one named Balinor stuttered a moment, stared at the floor below, and began to answer.

"Pappy.... dey... dey ma friends.  Secian heal hurt Thugs, Flerian special, she heal too!  Da Front not ma fault, I have nuttin ta do wit hi-"

"Nuff!!" Thwack shouted, slamming the back of his hand into Balinor's face, "Mages all same! Mages share thoughts! Mages ruin Buckhannia!"

There was something of these Thugians... something I could not piece together, and curiousity began to torment me.  How could there be a Thugian mage?  Putting up a aura of magick force, I revealed myself.  Both Thugians shrieked, as the shorter one lunged forward.  Balinor caught him before the sword dismembered my head, and shouted "Wesley! Git down, I wanna see how dis guy got out.  Mebbie he know sumptin of why Oog-ra's came ta kill us."
Realizing it was my chance to speak, I began to talk, "I am Pagaine Souleater, a warlock of Taath, and a scholar... you fascinate me, Balinor?" the tall mage grunted, "I wonder how you could become a mage... nonetheless, I have taken interest in your problem, and offer my services."

"If we refuse?" A tall barbarian Thugian that looked almost identical to Wesley entered, and stood beside him.

"Well, I could just cast a ice wall... and freeze you all to death, but I'm  a scholar, and I wish to record this battle for my records... plus I have a blue aura up, Balinor, so don't think I won't cast an ice wall..."

The humming continued from the kitchen and a voice called, "Actually, it wasn't up long."  I knew, she was right.

Day 15: After spending a number of days with the Thugians, I discovered them to be very hard working and efficient people.  Smith's made giant quartz greatswords, and with the help of Balinor, flaming bastard swords, which burned like the pits of hell itself.  Every once and a while I saw Balinor's mother, who I heard her name was Panzer, watch intently with dark eyes that shone with knowledge.  Whoever this woman was, I could not understand her, but maybe the way her head glistened, as if diamond, and intelligent words, could be the answer to my question.  How could there be a Thugian mage?  I had heard of one, a tall Thugian, with the name of "Bonebreaker," but that was just an old tale to scare children of snapping dragons with huge tails.

New armor was being ringed out for Balinor, translucent in colour, it reflected all the light around it, and seemed to suck it up into the mail, entrapped for magickal use.  Giant spikes jutted outward from it, and I knew, that in close combat, an enemy could easily be impaled upon them.  The maker, a human, which puzzled me more, draped in forest green material.  The human continued to make all sorts of bizzarre and wondrous items, and when he was finished, simply walked out, pulling a Newt along with him.

The army training area was a sight to see.  Over 500 hundred Thugian males, from Buckhannia and adjoining Trybes, practiced daily rotations of flipping, stabbing even practicing to rip a  practice target apart with their bare hands.  Wesley was teaching them many a move with a blade, while his son, Smakem showed them various techniques of fighting barbarian-like which included ripping off limbs with their teeth, and heads with their feet.  Telemad, Wesley's wife sat through this, occasionally casting vigors at her beloved husband, who seemed to continue on through each tiring workout.  Balinor sat with me in a corner for awhile, not saying a word, studying each of his family with growing interest, and worry.  Suddenly he spoke up. 
"I not like dis..."  The Thugian mummered.

"W-what?" I seem surprised that the mage was talking at last.

"I not like dis... dis whole war ting, pappy's been ravin on fer hours about it... sumptin gonna happen, I not like it."

I didn't say a word, but nodded my head.

Day 17:  Today the Oog-ra's lined into an army, now over 1,000 of them, they were an awesome force.  An occasional Flerian bounced among them, but seemed to disappear as soon as they were found.  Thwack gave order to move out, and Buckhannia's army was divided into divisions.... the first division: Flaming steel, was Balinor's, he stood among 100 of Thugians, wielding flaming blades which rang in anticipation.  Balinor shaved his head for the occasion, and the dark rune of plague burned utop his skull, a symbol for the upcoming wrath on the Oog-ra's.  The second: Quartz death  was led by Wesley, who gribbed his massive sword in both hands, with 200 Thugians behind him... his son Smakem stood nearby, and I spotted Telemad praying for a hide behind him.  The last: The Trybes, was a massive army of 300 men, led by the small Flerian, who now wore a ice necklace around her neck, and the Secian, who waved a wand at the Thugians to get them into line, when another small Secian joined alongside of her... strange Secian this one was, wearing a walnut on his head, and continued to rave to the Thugians, "One with the emerald! One with the Sparklie!!!"  Thwack Buckhanna sat utop a pillar overlooking his army with pleasure... Panzer at his side, a dark cloak pulled over her head.  Thwack raised a massive Thugwieser bottle, and threw it toward the battle field, as Quartz Death raced forward and split into two lines.  The Thugians met roughly three hundred Oog-ra's and about fifty Flerians.  The Flerians were mowed down at once, as the Oog-ra troops fought on.  Wesley was heard screaming "Buckhannia! Buckhannia!" before lopping off the head of two Oog-ra's.  Telemad appeared behind her son Smakem, enveloping him in a red flame... Smakem jumped forward, and smash a massive club onto the heads of the enemy, the flame turning the enemy behind him to ash.  A loud grunt echoed as Flaming Steel pierced forward from the west of the Oog-ra's, cloaked by Balinor's blending aura.  Everyone of them began to slice down Oog-ra's, and helped Wesley's division who was mowed down one-third of his army.  Balinor began to cast red auras this way and that, compliments of his mother, as Oog-ra's fell gasping on limp knees and began to spasm, from the cold enveloping their bones.  A shriek erupted from behind the Oog-ra lines, and Flaming Steel and Quartz Death recoiled in horror... fifty 3rd stage Dragons flew overhead like the reaper themselves, spitting flame on the defensless Thugians who scattered.  Wesley's team was down to 75, and Balinor's 25... but stopped a moment and rushed the dragons.  Wesley stood on his head for a moment as a Dragon swooped down.  Clipping his leg's upward, the massive Thugian caught hold of the dragon, before impaling it with his massive blade.  The Dragon swerved upward, shrieking and crying in Dragon tongue, before letting out flame on the Oog-ra ranks, blinded by pain.  Wesley leaped down and ripped his blade out, grinning his amusement and whipping his blackened face.  Balinor began to send small sleeping darts this way and that, as Dragons fell from terrific hieghts, before being shredded by burning blades and ripping hands of Smakem, and other barbarians.  The strange Secian yelled "Kaaaaaaablooooie!" as fire spheres darted burning dragons to ash.  The Oog-ra's retorted in terror, as the Thugian Trybes howled and snarled forward... the small Flerian danced and hopped about, yelling excitedly.  The Oog-ra's now only down to 200, knew a lost cause, and quickly ran back west, where they had come from.  A loud cheer erupted from the Thugian army, as they all ran back to celebrate a battle well fought.  Balinor grunted his approval, before being bowled over by the small Flerian, beaming and yelling.  Smakem suffered the occasional scratch, and received treatment from the female Secian.  Wesley, lost a finger or two, but was happy of the loss, grunting "Man marks!"	

I could not believe my eyes, that such a small force of Thugians could beat such a large group of Oog-ra's something did not seem right.  

Day 20:  Standing up on this tall ledge surveying the carnage of war, I turned to Thwack, who grunted at my look.   A idea flashed through my mind.  If Thwack died, I could claim the land, and Panzer, to teach me the ways of how she acquired magick.  Staring at Thwack through emotionless eyes, and a spell churning through my brain, I cast.

***************

Another cry echoed throughout the battlefield, but this time from the air.  Thwack Buckhanna, King of Buckhannia flew over the top of his watch tower, arms flailing to grab anything in sight.  He landed with a sickening thud, the crown sparkled a final time, then grew dim.  Balinor growled deep in his throat as Wesley unsheathed his sword.  Above the tower, a Fronc glanced downwards, a twisted smile on his face.  His joy was short-lived when Panzer called to Sa and a giant blue beam shot from the skies, into her hand, straight through the heart of the Scholar.  Pain and anguish reflected into his eyes, as he slowly crumpled away to nothing. 

Hovering down, Panzer Buckhanna looked down at her deceased husband with slight grief.  Picking up the crown she placed it on her head, gave a final glance to her family, and led her army back home.

--CIBOLA---

By Chiriga Zenphiir

I heard the bells of old Taath temple ringing out over the sand last night.

Saccha'i just grunted at me when I told him.  He holds nothing in  reverence now that his mate is dead—got the Whispers and walked off  alone, at mid-day, when the rest of us look for cool shadows to keep us  from broiling in our carapaces under the sun-- and he is our best fighter  now, throwing himself into battle like fresh blood is all that keeps him  alive; like he's praying for a talon or a dagger to send him back to Taath. And nothing hits him, ever.

He'll get the Whispers himself soon.  Or just give up and lay down in the sun, and wait to die.

So I went a little ways past the edge of camp to listen.  Desert wind brought those bells to me in its howling.  That wind never ceases,  and at night it is bitter cold, and some say you can hear voices in it, 
the desert speaking to you...When the voices become all that you can hear,  you have the Whispers, and those seductive demon voices lead your off into the deep dunes, to bake in the sun.

I'd never heard the windvoice, until that night; perhaps the  desert knew I would listen to nothing else.  I have no time for voices. But the echo of my Lord Taath; those bells!

Long time before I returned to the fire; the moon in its endless fall left us behind, abandoning the sky full of stars.  The desert is incomprehensibly dark at night, and makes of everything a silver-edged shadow.

I dreamed.

And in my dream it was the old city come to me, in all her dusky  splendor, as I had heard my mother tell it-- stucco-skinned, barefoot, strong woman with dust in her hair, blood on her fingers; an earthen jar 
of water at her feet.  She sung a hymn, alien high-pitched raspy melody, and I closed my eyes as she anointed me with water from the jar, fingers of her left hand drawing the symbol of Taath in cool wet lines between my breasts.

And she pointed west and I saw the sun setting, scorching the sky, behind a huge ancient fig tree; and I woke up yearning.

For some reason the others were silent as I told them that we had to turn west.  Dreams of their own, perhaps.  Saccha'i didn't even stop to glare at me-- we packed, and we left; they didn't ask, and I didn't explain. The mountains followed us, shadows of the birth of the world, locked in silent stone forever.

I was not surprised when we saw that tree on the horizon.  The hollow-sounding bells caught and danced on the wind again as we approached.

Desert-dwelling scorpions half as big as we were waited at the tree's roots, snapping at something.  Venom gave their stingers a pale milky sheen.  They fought something quick and slender and black; a dervish 
warrior wrapped in rags.  It flew; it danced in a smooth deft ecstasy of bloodlust; the scorpions fell before it.  Desert wind curled its long fingers around the fighter, murmuring hushed approval.

Little Liasa, the wild abrupt one, joined that ragged shadow with an enthusiastic screech, tearing legs and crushing chitin with abandon.  Saccha'i and I watched, silent, as the two decimated their prey.

The sand was sticky with blood when they were done; the ragged figure saluted Liasa with its shattered broadsword.  She chittered curiously at it in reply, faceted ruby eyes glittering, and bowed, and the figure swept back its tattered hood and looked at me with a kind of recognition in its dark eyes.

Moons later and the desert is giving way to grasslands.  There is much food and we are brewing new flesh wine, but something in me reaches for the lonely desert wind, and something in it, I think, reaches back.

Kyloa is still with us.  Saccha'i too, surprisingly; the old killer took Liasa under his wing at some point and the two are quite a formidable team now, Liasa quick and merry and devious, Saccha'i solemn and powerful.  It seems Kyloa has brought him to a new faith in Taath.

The dark one and I fight together, but we seldom talk.  There is little to say.  I think the desert calls him, too.  The elvish-slanted eyes in that dusky face are often distant, especially at night, when we watch the fire and drink flesh wine.  He calls himself San;  I don't know what that means.  I have never yet seen another like him.

We are very far from the old city.  I never hear the bells any more.

To be, or not to be…PvP

With my first journey to spur, I was confronted, as all Spurians have been, by Mort Sa-al, the 3 ft dragon, and the question: Do you want to be immune from Player vs Player attacks?

 Is it that simple?  Is it just another question?  Actually, all the questions asked are important.  The most important to me, however, is the PvP choice.

As an anthian who has seen both sides of the story, I have my own opinion.  Player versus player immunity.. how do you describe it?...  sucks?  It reeks of marsh reaper's manure mixed with some yelican droppings sprinkled delicately with bits of wet newt liver.  Really.  Maybe it's not that bad, but it does take away the entire Spurian identity.

To be immune to other players mean that you cannot spar.  Nope.  Not even a small fire dart.  It also means that you cannot be pickpocketed.  Being stolen from is somewhat a Spurian experience.  I love thieves.  They now steal from me, and I hug them.  Being immune means that gladiator game mean nada (zero) to you.

Being immune, however, gives you the security of saying whatever you want, and never having to suffer the consequences.  Being immune makes everything so much easier, such as carrying around money and never fearing thieves, never fearing sleep dart, never fearing someone 'web of fear'-ing you.  

I converted to PvPism, not because some fir elf spit in my face for being PvP-unable (which really did happen), but basically because of the weekly games (Saturday 8 pm EST).  The first time I entered, I didn't know that I had to be PvP-able.  So, I was left standing there, kinda watching everyone else's limbs falling over the places.  It was really really bad.

I chose unwisely.  I regret my mistake.  Because of my choice, I could not live up to my duties as forestor, which is something the DGate manual leaves out.  The different duties of occupations, and emphasis on 1)  alignment 2)  god 3)  and obviously, PvP status.

Choose wisely, that all anyone can say.  And saying that it's just another choice that will affect your life is an understatement.  It can fester like a wound, and cause your whole life to revolve around it.  Like how it did mine.  Luckily, a nice Elder took pity on me, and sprinkled me with some dust, making me PvP-able, making me a new Spurian.  (wink to Ursula).

Life and Times of A Young Frontacian 
by Farssh Othuran

Life can be hard when you're a Frontacian.  The Spur is a rough place, and it seems that everywhere you look, you see people that are bigger and stronger than you.  It can be intimidating.  It doesn't help any - the fact that I seem to be almost alone in the world, so far away from Sorcerer's Isle, our homeland, and seat of the greatest empire this world has ever known.  It seems that I can go days without seeing another friendly gem-studded face around, so when I do, it's a special occasion.  Some races clearly don't suffer from this trouble.  Take the Leuians, for example - plenty of them around.  Too many, I sometimes think.  I mean, you can't swing a dead cat without hitting a Khat (as the expression goes).  It makes you wonder if they're up to something, increasing their numbers, breeding like mad.  They must be up to no good - sure they have their honor, their Pride, but still…can't help thinking that at some point, when they outnumber all other races combined, something bad will happen for the rest of us.

Not that there aren't plenty of good things about us Frontacians - a sense of uniqueness for one.  With so few of us around the Spur, I feel somewhat unique.  Some would worry that this would be a cause for despair, but that is not so.  Sometimes it's good to be alone, good to collect your thoughts, reflect on life.  Not too good when a nasty band of muggers slips out of the shadows and starts harassing you,  but we have ways of dealing with them.  I will someday, anyway, if I'm lucky.  I can handle the occasional attacker one at a time, but I can get into trouble beyond that.  Someday, with practice, study,  and a little luck, I will be powerful enough to handle the toughest of foes, and come out of it in one piece.  

For a while, things looked particularly bad, when Spur's criminal element seemed to show up in waves.  They concentrated in large groups, determined to cause as much havoc as possible. They were mostly just large groupings of rogues or muggers.  Not dangerous individually, but apparently they had learned that there's strength in numbers.  Many of the citizens of Spur eagerly rushed to the places where they would gather, but for me it was a nightmare.  I'd be walking along, on my way to Market Circle, when all of the sudden, I'd be surrounded by five or six crazy muggers, all swinging their hammers at me.  The only thing that made sense was to run - which was easier said than done.  I'd try to move away, and one of them were always standing in my way.  Fortunately, an aura of blending would get me out of there before it was too late.  Thankfully, they've discontinued this practice, preferring to cover more territory, I guess.

Many in this world rely on muscle to solve their problems - either by beating senseless some creature of the wilds that happened to cross its path, or trying to win an argument with a club or sharp blade, rather than a sharp tongue or sharp mind.  Others rely on dexterity and speed - after all, the best protection is to never get hit.  For me, and others of my kind, that is not really an option.  For us, we have a complete reliance on the arts of magick.  We simply don't have any other means of self-defense.

For me, magick is my life, my blood.  There's something quite satisfying about frying someone between the eyes with a lightning bolt.  Sure, I carry a small dagger around, but it's mainly just for show - it doesn't really provide much protection.   I have a few good ways of doing harm, with fire, acid, and even smoke -  but I know the good stuff is still to come.  Fortunately, I can also fix myself up after a rough battle.  I just need a quiet little corner to hide away in for a while.  I'll occasionally try my hand at first aid - not bad, but not great.  A good healing spell never fails, though.  That's an important lesson - stick to what works.  It's much more reliable than the clerics and their laying of hands, which only seems to work well for the highest of clerics.

Lately, it seems, magick is behaving a little strangely.  Perhaps the great God Sa is on vacation right now, or maybe he's just testing us - the gods have been known to do that from time to time.  Some spells I had come to rely on, I have forgotten how to use.  I am not worried, however. I am sure that they will come back to me eventually.  I must admit, the world of magick seems somehow more exciting now, if that's even possible.  As I get older, I can learn increasingly more powerful spells - it gives me something to look forward to.  With the magickal laws of the land in constant flux, it's difficult to guess what will happen, how things will be in the coming weeks and months.  Still, however, I am optimistic - magick will always be my life, regardless of how it changes.  It could be no other way.

As I said earlier, there are many good things about being a Frontacian.  One of the most important items is our clear mastery of the arts of magick.  We pride ourselves on being the best of runemages.  Magick comes to us quite naturally, as smashing things with a rock is to an Oog-ra.  I remember when I was a child, back in the homeland, seeing the elders of our race perform incredible feats of magic - some of which were for some highly important cause, some just for show. I also remember watching as the more skilled members of my race would create very powerful magickal weapons - weapons which could aid greatly in keeping the more adventurous of our people alive.  I believe it was also a source of income, selling or trading the weapons away to less capable races.  Fighters throughout the Empire were proud to own a Frontacian weapon, one that was so much more than just a piece of steel or quartz.  Often, it meant the difference between life and death for them - not that it mattered much to us, anyway.  There were always a steady stream of customers, it seemed. Unfortunately, weapon crafting seems to be something of a lost art - I haven't seen anyone even attempt it since I left the homeland and traveled here to Spur.  Maybe as I get older I will try my hand at it, to try and resurrect the time-honored traditions of my ancestors.

One of the best things about being a Frontacian is the one thing that seems to cause the most discomfort among the other races in the Spur.  Most by now have heard of our ability to drain fatigue out of others - either heard about it or experienced it firsthand.  It's a remarkably useful ability - if I'm feeling tired, I can just reach out and touch someone, and I'll be rejuvenated.  It's essential for maintaining those tiring spells - I don't know how the other races survive without it. Some seem to take offense at being drained, but they really shouldn't.  It's a perfectly natural, as well as completely harmless process.  All you have to do is just sit down and rest, and you'll be as good as new.  I personally try to have some consideration for the other races around me - especially when they outnumber me greatly - and will only drain someone when absolutely necessary.  Unless, of course, they are trying to annoy me in some way.  The difficult part about being superior is the number of little things that start to annoy you (like a Psycian, for example).  If something or someone accosts me in the streets, a drain or two will calm them down considerably (except those rogues, who seem to have unnaturally high fatigue - they must work out or something).  Once the lucky victim is out of fatigue, the possibilities for punishment are almost endless, as are the possibilities for my enjoyment .  At this point, the offender deserves whatever he gets.

Even though life as a Frontacian can be hard, feeling like, as one has put it, "Spur's own punching bag", it is certainly rewarding.  Difficult times early on will give way to power and glory as I grow in experience and knowledge.  It will take time before I am strong enough to stand up to the rest of the Spur without fear or hesitation, but I am confident that day will come.

============================================================================

My beginnings are clouded at best.  I do not remember the journey through the dragon's gate I assume that my mother brought me through at a very young age.  My mother brought me to this world while she still donned the human form.  I never got to see her full majesty in dragon form.  She cared for me through my troubled times for as long as she could.  She had to leave before I had fully recovered because she started feeling the changes returning.  She returned to her world and I was left to mine new one.  I was left with a friendly family of Secians who wouldn't allow me to leave until I was fully recovered and so stuffed I could barely move (I still haven't lost all that weight to this day).  Though I loved the family dearly I knew that I was eating them out of house and home (their home was just too small very cute but small I was sleeping under the heavens anyhow).  I mean a ate as much food in one meal as they both did in a entire week.  So between my feelings of imposement and my inborn wanderlust I decided to part ways with my adopted family.  It was a hard goodbye and I wasn't allowed to go without a last meal and them giving me a few things that my mother had left me for she new this day would come.

I traveled to many far lands in my search for knowledge, wisdom, and a general lack of purpose.  I visited many of the lands that the people of spur call home.  I visited the outskirts of Skaa and Secia but that is far as I dared to tread it was beautiful but the tallest of there spires was only about 100ft tall which may be small to even a Hithual but if you're less then 2 ft tall, a beautiful and large palace it is.  I attempted to visit some of the ancient Hithual forges (as a note don't try this at home ) but understandably I was requested to take my leave.  I was still young but smart enough not to cross 4 Hithual armsmasters who decided that I was unwelcome.  I wondered to the forests the fir elves were said to inhabit.  I ran into a few Elves which seemed very surprised at my presence, but I never was invited or came upon the actual Elven city.  I pondered trying to find the Athians homeland but then remembered that it was many many moons until I would gain my wings, and looking upon the terrain decided better of that trip.  I thought for maybe a second or two about checking out the Mutana-Al or San Elf home lands but thought better of it,  something about inviting death to ones front door.

It has been 37 moons since I left my adopted family.  My funds and my wanderlust started to wane, and I decided that my travels of the world were to come to a end so I decided to find someplace that I would be able to call home.  I heard of a city by the name of Spur in my travels it seemed that everyone had been there or was on their way there.  Traders, Mercenaries, Fighters, Healers, Mages any and all races seemed to be headed to or from there.  I heard that there were more dragons there than any other place in the world at this time, so I packed my meager belongings and started the long journey to what I would hopefully call home.  On the first few days of my journey I started felling the changes I was warned about.  My funds remaining funds ran out in just a few days feeding my overwhelming appetite.  My headaches were becoming worse and if it wasn't for the wayward pines that I spent many  a night in unprotected environment (having a childhood friend that was a forester was more valuable than I could ever imagine).

I knew the first change was coming and that it would be one of the most traumatic experiences that I would have till I started the staging process.  I decided to wait out the next few days in a large wayward pine.  When the pains of the changes weren't overwhelming me I collected any food that I could and enough wood and bedding material to keep me comfortable as I could out in the wilds that I now found myself.  I had about two days before the pains became so unbearable that I was confined to my pine for all but the briefest periods.  I lost track of time during the worst of it days and nights blended into a haze of pain and confusion, for I knew only that changes would happen not what they would entail.  I remember looking around to find that it was early morning my fire was long since cold, my food stores totally gone or spoiled,  and all my clothes at best were tight.  I looked over the body that I used to know to find that I had a silver/gray hued leathery skin and the beginnings of what looked to be claws.  I searched my pack for my spare set of clothes I found that only my cloak and a now tight but manageable pair of pants and tunic would have to do until I could afford a new set of clothes.  I grabbed my pack and last of my supplies and decided I needed to make spur in the next few days of travel otherwise I would go hungry.  I tried to pick up the pace of my travel but found that I was a little clumsier and still a little lightheaded though I found that weight of my pack was like that of a  feather.  I only made about half the distance that I had hoped when I decided to find a place to wait out the night and what looked like a brewing storm.  I kept up as fast of a pace as I could handle in my condition until I found another wayward pine which would keep me safe from the storm.  I came upon the pine only to find it occupied, luckily it was a friendly Leuian forester who was kind enough to offer me some food and the shelter of his pine.  I woke the next morning to find that the forester was gone.  I gathered my things making sure they were all there and continued on.  The rest of my trip was adventureless, which brings me to where I am today. 

I have been in spur now about 13 moons.  I have focused myself on continuing my quest for knowledge and developing my Entropic nature.  I have made many friends and remarkably few enemies in my brief time in spur.  I attribute this mostly to the fact that I try to keep no preconceived notions about those of differing race, religion, class, or ideals.  I found that friends can be made anywhere given a little time and some patients.  I also try to solve problems that I encounter without runes or swords though I'm not against using them if the need arises.  Well I've taken up enough of your time as it is so I will end this now (can just imagine the applause at this).

DA LESSION

Me remember a day,
From so long, long ago,
Me was just'a foolish youth,
Only thirty or so.

Grillka, me fair cousin,
On that day was to wed,
A joyious occassion,
Da truth ta be said.

Da clan spared no expence,
From Moldavian veils,
Ta dozens of barrels,
Of Hithualian Ales

Now me lova a good joke,
As all Hithuals do,
But ta prank da whole clan,
Would make me'a legend true

Then me laughed to meself,
As me thought of a plan,
Me crept out with da stealth,
of a most crafty San

Me carried out da ales,
One barrel after one,
Emptied'm inta da creek,
Filled'm with water when done

It is da perfect prank,
Me chuckled to meself,
Most awaited da ales,
More'n da wedding itself.

Then after da wedding,
At'a couples reception,
When da bride and da groom,
With great expectation,

Exchanged thier wedding mugs,
Made of silver and gold,
They went to'a barrels,
Ale da mugs were ta hold.

Terror, shock, and dismay,
Raged across thier faces,
As water filled da mugs,
Takin' da ales places.

Horror swept da carern,
Da whole clan was amazed!
Me laughed out in triumph,
But then Grillka was crazed!

"Meqetlh!", she yelled fiercely,
"Ye did this evil deed!
I shall slay ye quite dead,
by Odarous, indeed!"

She grabbed her war hammer,
Violence in her eye,
Me then ran for me like,
Me did not want to die!

"T'was'a joke, dear Grillka",
While running, me pleaded,
But me knew from her face,
Me words were not heeded!

Me ran throughout da cav'rns,
Until me rounded a bend,
And making a wrong turn,
Ran into a dead end!

Me turned ta see Grillka,
And me heart filled with dread,
With one swing of'da hammer,
She smote me quite dead!

Me ghost stood there for hours,
Waiting where me corpse lay,
For m'clan didn't rezz me,
Until late da next day!

Pa wouldn't look at me,
Mother's eye held a tear,
Most wouldn't speak to me,
For well over a year!

Thinkin' back to dat day,
Me learned me lesson well,
Don't pull'a prank at'a wedding,
And ne'er mess with'a Hith's ale!

Slepinfiction

You bump into Slepinfire at bazaar, as he is trying to find Sylvenn, his Chosen.  He greets you with an enormous dragon hug, and considering his girth, you gasp for air.  He asks you if you have seen Sylvenn, and when you say no, he frowns and mumbles something.  You think you hear him say probably off getting into more trouble.  He asks you another question, and it isn't long until he won't shut up.

So, you have never heard one of me tales?  Ok, ok, me must tell you the one involving Sylvenn, considering me can't find the Lil fearless one.

One fine eve, me, Sylvenn, and Erana, the Secian Sword Cleric, were on our way to the Haunted House to find some trolls.  It wasn't hard to recruit these two; all I said was the possibility of diamonds, and they were draggin (no pun intended) me to our hunt.

When we reached the gate to the Haunted House, our party was greeted by a bone-chilling gust of wind.  We thought nothing of it at the time, but me now look back on it as a warning of what was to come.  We continued on to the door and were met by a score of skeletons! The undead were chanting "Death.  Death.  Death," as they tried to make us one of them.  Now, at this point, me was not scared, for Erana was cutting them down with her blade, and Sylvenn was throwing lightning bolts left and right.  For precautionary reasons, me linked for my Brother Derkestnai to come back us up with some friends.

Me is glad the call was put out, for just as me was turning the last skeleton into a Mjolnir-made pancake, the HH door exploded outward, taking out Erana and Sylvenn.  Me looked up at the door in time to see dozens of wraiths, spirits, and shades spewing out.  Me only thought was to drag Erana and Sylvenn to the outward gate, and lock it.  The hundred or so undead advanced on us.  The chant of "Death.  Death.  Death," become deafening.  Me threw Erana over me shoulder, and tucked Sylvenn under me arm, and made a mad dash for the gate.

And crashed right into the coldest, scariest, most feared undead of them all.  Death, himself, incarnate.  Shock, then fear, crossed my face.  Me remembers saying, "but…but…you are vanquished…you are dead in the Realm."  Death cackled at me, throwing back his cowl to reveal his bare-skulled  visage and gestured at the gate with his blood-red scythe.  Me heard it close, then lock.

"Death may be delayed, but I am never vanquished from any Realm.  You wish to frequent my House, murder and  pillage my kin, and not be punished for it, Worm?"  he said in a low, scratchy voice that reminded me of bone scratching on bone.  "Now learn what it is to challenge Death!"  he said, as his minions closed in on us.  Sylvenn stirred, thank his god Sa, and woke to the sight of the evil grins of  the undead.  He gestured quickly, and rainbow shimmers removed all three of us to outside of the locked gate.  

As the world blinked back into view, we could hear evil laughter, and a voice entered our minds, "Oh, go ahead prepare yourselves … to die."  Me stood up and looked around to find a small militia gathered.  Derkestnai, me Dragon Brother, had indeed brought friends:  BladeEdge and Phenix, the Levian couple, and Skylar, the blowgunmaster Anthian.  Their looks of concern deepened as me summized the situation.  Erana was healed up, and a very unSecian-like growl came forth from her.  "A door!  I let a door take me out?  They will fall beneath the sweeps of my schythe," she said, waving her holy blade at the gate.  Derkestnai, chiding me as always, said, "Oh, only Death.  No biggie.  Slep, you ALWAYS bring me into your trouble.  But, I guess that is why I love you."  The Khats only nodded at me, sheathing their weapons in favor of their three inch razor-sharp claws.  Me distinctly remember seeing Phenix pull out a file to sharpen them.

The chant of "Death" grew louder, as the gate started to buckle under the undeads' combined weight.  The group quickly devised a plan in which Sklyar would fly as high as possible and take out the toughest opponents with his blowgun.  The Khats and Erana would take the point in hand-to-hand combat, leaving Derk, me, and Sylvenn to cast at the montrosities.  A quick glance over at Sylvenn revealed a look of joy and boredism on his face.  Me raised eyebrow at him brought forth the response, "Hey.  It is not everyday you get to takes on a big meanie baddie and his friends with your friends.  This is going to be funnnn!"  He then took off into the air and did some aerial acrobatics.  Me couldn't believe his attitude, and the gasp on me face was met with a wink from him.

Only the Khats quick reflexes and Erana's experience saved them from the rennants of the exploding gate..  The shades and spirits came thru first.  Before me group of casters got five spells off, the front line had shreaded the insubstantial undead to pieces, leaving only pouches and closed chests behind.  BladeEdge and Phenix kissed each ??? while on top of a pile of melting shades.  Derk and me rolled our eyes, but felt the eve was to be ours.

Me should have known better, for next the wraiths and little things issued through the gate.  Sylvenn and me had to throw heals and vigors, while Derkestnai and Skylar joined the frontal line.  Even with this formidable group, we were hard pressed to keep them at bay.  My Brother received a mortal wound, as a thing slipped through his defenses to score a hit to his head.  Me screams of rage finally silenced the chanting, as me pulled my Brother back, and cradled him in me arms.  Erana next fell, as she had been too tired from laying hands on the Khats.  A wraith sliced her stomach, and she doubled over from the pain.

The undead suddenly withdrew, as Death stepped through the gate.  His damnable laughter burned in me ears, as he pointed to Erana and Derk.  "Ah, I see two more ready to join MY Realm," he whispered to me.  When he gestured at my fallen comrades, they turned a pale gray color and lay very still.  

An evil grin came to his mandible, and he said, "Prepare to join them and me."  A quick look and nod sent Sklyar zooming out a view into the sky.  Me still does not know where it came from, but an instinct told me to cast a fire aura at Death.  As I did so, the Khats came in clawing away at his bony form.  Sylvenn was behind me, whistling some Secian tune with a smile on his face.  Me yelled at him, " Vigor me.  And do something!"  A frown crossed his face as he started flying toward Death.

Sylvenn readied his short ruby thunder morningstar, and started whacking Death over the head.  Any other time, me would have laughed at the sight.  Death was swatting at Sylvenn like an annoying gnat.  This allowed me spells, the Khat's claws, and Skylar's darts to get thru his defenses.  He was sent backwards by an acid bolt, and Sylvenn knocked the Reaper on his tailbone with a visage swing of the star.  Sylvenn giggled at Death, saying, "You're not so tough, you overgrown skeleton."  We actually had him on the ropes!

Death jumped to his feet, and gestured at the Khats.  They froze in place, and then slumped down to the ground, turning pale gray in each other's arms.  "Two more," he spat at me, "to join my army."  A number of rune gathered around me, freezing me in place.  Death smiled at me, but also winced at all the efforts his spells were taking.  Sylvenn sneaked up behind him, raising his star for a blow.  Death simply threw out his arm, blocked the blow, and flicked Sylvenn away with his bony appendage.  Sylvenn went sprawling head first into me, knocking me over.  Me was still held by the runes, not able to move.

Death winced in pain, as a look of frustration came over his face.  Me could tell he was pressing and hurt badly.  So could Skylar, who was still way up above.  A volley of darts rained down all about - me wondered if there was such a thing as a dart storm.  Death grabbed BladeEdge's corpse to use as a shield.  A few darts found their mark, but most did not.  Death finally got a spell off, sending a dissolve flesh spell at Skylar that knocked him from the sky.  His charred remains hit the ground with the sound of death echoing all about.  This was it, and me knew it"

"This was no challenge!  Is this all this Realm had to offer me?," he screamed at me.  "This was a game, worm, and obviously, for me, it was no game of  chance.  For you and yours had none."  Death gestured at BladeEdge, Phenix, Erana, and Skylar's corpses, and with a fiery spark, they all stood.  "You see Worm, I have officers for me army now.  We march on your Spur tonight," he said.
He motioned at Sylvenn the same way, but Sylvenn opened his eyes, winked at me, and soared into the air, narrowly avoiding the zombie-bolt.  Me chosen was still alive!  What little joy me received from that fact soon left me as me realized he had no chance against the Master of the Undead.
Sylvenn flew up to Death and said, " So, you wanna play games?  Games of chance, huh?  Ok, I gots one for you.  But there must be risks involved on your part.  I propose if you lose, I get all my buddies back unharmed and your abolishment from my Realm.  If I lose, well ,you get all my help in your conquest of my Realm."

Death looked back at the diminutive one and said, "Why should I, Master of Spur, bargain with you?  Look at your force, and see what I did to them.  Why shouldn't I do the same to you?"
Sylvenn giggled his reply, "Cause I am just a lil fairy and you are the Master of Demise, King of Undead, Ruler of Misery.  Are you afraid of losing to a fairy?  Probably, you overgrown bone pile." Death stared at Sylvenn, and then spat.

A story about Spoon

Hey dere everybuddy, its me, dat silly lil' thug who keeps peelin' Flerians frum his maul, Spoon Buckhanna! ::Applause:: Anyway, I took some time off frum beatin endlessly on sharkies and taked da time ta rite dis story dat me mum used ta tell me sometimes aftur ar Thugweiser baths. It about how da draggunfly came ta be. Ah met up wit a dragginfly wunce, ah tinked ta meself, "Ha ha! Lookit at dat lil thing buzzin and hummin! Ah'll smash it!" Yeah, dat wut me tinked, but it had different plans. Mainly, biting me practikully in half through me armer (Ah also had a similer sperience wit a fire and a lil' ting). Anyways, here it go, strait frum da thug's mouth:...

A long long long long time go, back when Secians wuz ate feet tall, when you seed dem Muats heart clerics of Elindale as frekwint as you see dem Secian ones tuday. Back when dem silly Arachnians wuz as nice and kuddley as Secians, dere wuz a bunch of dragguns. Two of em stood out, Bonanza and Alfonzo. Da two were da same age, and wuz practically born on da same day, and growed up ta be reeeeeeeeeeeel trubble makers. 

At furst stage, dey stealed dere first god-gift; at seckund stage, dey de-winged dere furst Secian; at 3rd stage, dey skinned a Looian and gave him a nice, long, bath of salt. But da reel killer wuz, at 4th stage, dey performed da tousand cuts to a lot of non-dragguns. Now, lemme take a sec ta splain wut da tousand cuts is. Imagine a Looian wit all his boddie parts intakt. Kay? Got it? Now, imagine him witout his fingers, toes, ears or manhood, dats wut da tousand cuts is. Da udder draggins opposed dis, so Bonanza and Alfonzo killed nearly alla da udder ones, cept a few dat skaped. At dis time, da two had grown up tagethur and gradually became lovurs. Den, dey're planz fur werld domination began. Furst, dey started wit da lovely city of Spur, and taked over it and rooled it harshly, and gradually dey taked over more and more of da werld. 

Now, half way cross da wurld, dere wuz a brave human knight named Arawn. Now, Arawn didna like wut he wuz hearing about Bonanza and Alfonzo, and he vowed ta get da wurld back ta normul at wutever costs it took. Swim da highest mountain, cross da largest peanut, and climb da deepest oshin (Er somethin like dat). So he started his trek cross da wurld ta stop da tyrant draggins.

When he got ta dey're cassull, he yelled out, "Come out you cowardly iguana, and fight me. For I challenge you to a duel! And the winner shall be the new ruler of Spur!" Now, dis reely made Alfonzo mad, cuz it wuz da mating time for da draggins, and-ya guys out dere know what I'm talkin' bout-nobody likes ta git intarupted when dey in da middle of dey're mating time. 

Dis also scared Alfonzo a tiny bit, because he knew that da human knight musta known dat Alfonzo and Bonanza had great powerz, so he woodn't jez come alla dis way jez ta kummit suicide. So dis made Alfonzo tink that Arawn wuz really skilled. No matter, Alfonzo thinked ta himself, I shall dispose of this weak being and get back to what I was in the middle of. 

So Alfonzo swooped down from his castle tower where he wuz sleepin, and landed a few meters away from where the human was standing. "Shall we begin?" Arawn asked, as he laft coldly. Alfonzo didn't answer, but jez snarled and spat a blast of fire that Arawn dodged easily.

Arawn laughed in a chillin' manner, and said, "You'll have to do better than that if you want to remain ruler of Spur, iguana face!" Arawn hacked at Alfonzo with such ferocity that he almost severed the dragon's arm. He chuckled ta himself, thinking that this was easier than he thought it would be. The knight went in again, but misjudged his slash and lost his balance. Alfonzo taked his oppertoonity and slashed the knight across the face wit his klozz. After Alfonzo picked one of Arawn's eyeballs off of his claw, he slashed again, but missed. Arawn wuz reely pissed now, and slashed again and again at his adverserrie.

Meanwhile, up at da tower, Bonanza had been watchin da whole ting and she feered fur her hubbie's life. She swooped down frum da tower and landed quietly behind da human. She took a deeeeeeeeeeeep breath, and breathed a solid streme of fire dat took Arawn by surprise, and charred him inta human charcoal. 

(Now, back in doze days, da way ta git stronger wuz priddy weird. If ya wanted ta be stronger, ya had ta eat somebuddy. Da stronger and more skilled dat person wuz dat ya ate, da stronger ya would git.)

So now Alfonzo, who wuz priddy cut up by now, split up the charred remains of Arawn wit his wife and eated him, and got reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeely powerful. Meanwhile, da gods had been watching da whole ting, and saw how honorable da human was, and how unhornorable da dragons wuz, so dey shrinked da dragons so dey was teency tiny itsy bitsy reely small, and in doin so, made em less powerful. Dey also ressurected Arawn, and as a reward for being so honorable, dey made him da first elder of Spur.

Da End

Leyenda Marcaset 
 
Any number of words
Could not describe my love for you.
A picture is a thousand words, all of them in the world
Could not describe my love for you.
 
With every breath I take
I think of you.
Every breeze
Softly whispers your name
 
I am forever yours,
My heart is bound to you.
Not words, pictures, poems or rings,
Nor any of all material things,
Can describe my love for you.
 
Nothing short of total destruction of this world
Shall keep me away from you,
And not even that
Shall keep my soul from you,
My true love, Leyenda.

"The News about the Moos"
By: Nempheri, all around cool gal & the player of Zenthiana Drakula

I suppose it's about time to address that question that has been on everyone's mind, no, not who would win in a match of wits between Wesley, Jazbo and a rock, but where do all of those silly yet alarming shouts of "Moooo" originate from.  Well, though this one-time-only agreement with the Spurian Bovine Committee on Public Relations and Cheese Roll Sales, I Smirgle the cow am going to tell you my story.

Well, my very early life passed without incident, I was born on a small ranch outside of Leuia, a bleak future to be sure.  Leuians preference for red meat tends to spell a bleak  future for a young steer such as myself.  Lucky for me, my impressive intellect was noted at an early age.  The farmer's pesky youngest son became stuck in a well early one day at the farm.  I had just happened to be walking by this point, theorizing on the mating habits of the wild aardvarks that also inhabited our farm, when I head a shriek from the well.  Rushing immediately to the scene, I pushed a nearby Collie into a ditch and went to calling for assistance with my now legendary "Moo," but, I'm getting ahead of myself.  The farmer was so grateful that he turned me over to the Committee for a few Spurian killer 2nd squirrel pelts.  Bringing me to my current position. 

I know what you really want to know it was it is that I actually do.  Well, my day consists of a rigorous schedule of getting up late in the afternoon and fraternizing with the cows for a bit.  Afterwards I strap on my trust magical wings, a gift from Aloysious himself, and leap off to find some hapless (or overly amorous) adventurers.  Many ground dwellers do not realize how beautiful Spur is from the sky.  You should ask your nearest Anthian.  I fly around for a bit enjoying the scenery until I spot a group of adventurers that look slightly needing of some fun.  My quarry then spotted I zoom down in front of them and usually succeed in scaring the Reduxa out of them.  My job done I then send out a triumphant "MOOOO!" and fly off to buzz someone else.

Yes, it's a dirty job keeping those hardened adventurers on their toes, but somebody's got to do it, and I'm sure Skratchnar is too busy.  (I just hope he isn't stuck in another well....)
	
Well, I am off to continue my quest for adventure, silliness and the Spurian way!

My Interview wif Kraggy 
by Minerva Darkmyst 

The other day while I wasa sittin' in Town Square, healin' an' talkin' wif peoples, I suddenly remembered I had an appointment wif Kraggon Rockhard in the Rose Eternal Tavern. Givin' a li'l Secian-sized shriek, I hurried to the Market Circle. Smoothin' out my gown and makin' sure my tiara wasa on straight, I walked into the tavern an' saw hims sittin' at a quiet table in the corner wif quite a few empty ale-mugs in front of hims. I could feel myself blushin' as I flew up an' landed on top o' the table an' curtsied. As I wasa 'pologizin' for my lateness. 

Minerva smiles shyly, "Sorries for bein' late. I losted track of the time.
 
Kraggon grins and says (in a surprisingly sober voice, considering the number of empty ale mugs), "Quite alright, Lil' One."
 
Minerva giggles as she unrolls a blank scroll and readies a fluffy white quill. She sits down on the edge of the table and smoothes out her skirts.
  
Minerva says, "What isa the Colinth Argonix?"
  
Kraggon smiles with pride. "A Colinth Argonix be a union or fellowship of Hithuals. Each of our communities outside of the Great Divide has a Colinth Argonix. The phrase means 'Forge and Anvil' in the common tongue. So, sometimes folk can just call us the Forge."
  
Minerva nods and says, "What 'zactly does it do?"
  
Kraggon says, "So far, we have helped as many new Hithual immigrants as we can. We show them Spur and help them with manners and disputes. We do have a few rude Hithuals."
  
Kraggon rolls his eyes and sighs.
 
Minerva mutters something beneath her breath and nods to Kraggon.
 
Minerva sniffs and says, "I know the feelin'."
  
Kraggon says, "We also want to record our stories from the Great Divide and our history here. Ye know, many of us have even written short biographies."
 
Minervas beams and claps with delight.
 
Minerva says, "I love stories!"
 
Kraggon grins at Minerva.
  
Minerva blushes and says, "Isa it like a militia?
  
Kraggon's eyes get big.
  
Kraggon says, "No. We be not a militia, a clan, a brigade, a legion, or anything like that. We be Hithuals."
 
Minerva sticks the tip of her tonuge out of the side of her mouth while she jots something down.
  
Minerva says, "And you isa the leader-type person?"
  
Kraggon blushes. "Well ..."
  
Kraggon beams proudly. "I am honored to be the first Master of the Forge, the Colinth-tek. That means I preside at meetings, calling on speakers by waving me Hithual ale mug at them."
  
Minerva giggles and says, "An ale mug?"
  
Kraggon blinks in momentary confusion, then grins broadly to Minerva, "Well, yes. What else would we use? We're Hithuals."
  
Minerva giggles.
 
Kraggon says, "Anyway, we have four other elected officers. Rebel is our Magresh-tek, Hunt Master. He leads weekly hunts and helps new Hithual with finding good hunting lands. Forlan is the Donix, the Hammer. He handles military matters for the Forge. I'd add that both are highly skilled with weapons and are in the top ranks of the Fighter's Guild."
  
Kraggon beams proudly.
  
Kraggon says, "Armonius is our Progtah, the Revered One. He helps teach the new folk with issues of manners and religion. Ye know, he is at the top of the Sword Cleric guild."
  
Kraggon grins.
  
Kraggon's grin grows wider. "Then there be Jinko, who is the Gresh, the Shield. This is the clerical counterpart to the Donix. Jinko helps protect Hithuals in Spur from unprovoked attacks and unfair thefts. I think that he is the most colorful Hithual in Spur. Chaotic, ye know."
  
Kraggon nods and chuckles to himself.
 
Minerva dangles a sparkling glass slipper off her foot while she writes furiously.
 
Kraggon says, "We also have appointed positions. Kalys and Agouth are our Magick-teks, the Masters of Magick. Folk can ask them about the use of those rune thingees. Khain sort of is an unofficial Magick-tek, as well."
  
Minerva blinks and says, "Isn' they all sword clerics?"
  
Kraggon gasps as Minerva's sparkling glass slipper falls off her foot. He dives for it, and it plops into his ale.

Minerva shrieks and blushes bright pink.
  
Kraggon says, "Well, yes. That be as close as we can be to being a runie mage. Hithuals are not very magickal."
  
Kraggon suppresses a smile as he fishes the sparkling glass slipper out of his mug.
  
Kraggon says, "Theea be our Bolk-tek, the Brew Master. She advises on cultural matters. She also is a successful sword cleric. Exyx be our Sun-tek, our Master Chanter, or bard as ye all would say."
  
Minerva looks a bit perplexed, "But he isa  hand cleric."
  
Kraggon says, "Yes, but he has a soul of a poet."
  
Kraggon blinks as he hands the sparkling glass slipper back to Minerva.

Minerva blushes and pours the ale out of her slipper, then dries it off with a nearby rag before slipping it back on her foot.
 
Kraggon says, "Actually, all of them hand clerics can be a little odd. They get hit a lot in the head, ye know, as young 'uns."
 
Minerva grins in total agreement.
  
Minerva taps her chin with the quill and sneezes when the feather tickles her nose. 
 
Minerva sniffles a bit and says, "When does the Colinth Argonix meet?"
  
Kraggon grins. "We have Gatherings every couple of weeks or so. We meet the Hithual Hall. Great ambiance."
 
Minerva blinks at the use of such a big word.
  
Minerva blushes and says, "Isa the Hithual Gatherings like Khitty Pride meetings? Both rep... repre..."
 
Kraggon smiles at Minerva, "Represent."
 
Minerva beams to Kraggon and says, "Represent orderly groups."
  
Kraggon chuckles. "I've never been to a Pride meeting, but I expect that they are rich in solemn ritual. We are a little less formal. Armonius starts with a prayer. I go through the agenda items. Exyx and Snert tell jokes. Jinko touches himself. We throw things at Jinko. Ale is sipped, and mugs are brandished."
  
Kraggon wipes a tear from his cheek.
 
Minerva poorly attempts to supress a giggle.
  
Kraggon sighs and winks at Minerva.

Minerva calls for a fresh mug of ale for Kraggon.
  
Minerva grins at Kraggon. "Isa there a lots of Hithuals in Spur?
  
Kraggon leans back in his chair, "Folk come and go, but I think our numbers grow. Many of us have established ourselves here, only journeying back to the Great Divide on business and personal matters occasionally. Besides the folk that I've mentioned, Xxerox, Maddyn, Corren, Aedene, Grzarn, Solic, Angellic, Vasile, Cinzar, and many others have done well in their guilds. I am proud of them all."
  
Minerva swings her legs. "How does someone learn more 'bout Hithuals?"
  
Kraggon takes a long drink from his ale-mug and says, "We have a board in the Message Center, as well as areas in the Lore Center. The Lore Center also has scrolls written over 200 years ago by Jedico Bloodstar. He was the High Priest of Odarous and Lord of the Host. He also wrote much on our people and our history."
  
Mineva nods and jots something on her scroll, "Finally, what 'bout Hithual senses o' humor an' practical jokes?
  
Kraggon grins mischievously, "Ah well, our humor does evade some folk. Ye know, we be one of few races that are noted to have a sense of humor. We do like our practical jokes. Forlan and Rebel killed matriarch yelicans just for the empty chests that they used to have. They would drop them around Town Square and then hide to watch folk open them. We got quite a laugh from the looks on their faces. Jinko and I still do that with the empty gem sacs on young cicadas. We got you that time..."
  
Minerva raises an eyebrow and mutters something about Hithual sense of humor.
  
Kraggon clears his throat and sinks underneath the table.
 
Minerva stares at Kraggon who slips down until only his eyes peek out over the table top.
  
Kraggon says, "Well, sorry about that, Minerva. Want another ruby?"

We talked a bit after that an' Kraggon drank a whole bunches. I wasa verra surprised at the amount o' ale one Hithual can consumed... Kraggon isa definatly one o' the nices persons in the Spur an' I wasa verra honoured to be able to talk wif him.

Minstrels and Musings

Since this column will be reserved for the works of Bards and all things bardic, I'm including another stellar piece by Fynn Vyrrn, along with a poem from my recent collection:

Gypsie Queen of the Bards                 By Fynn (who wishes he was king) Vyrrn

The Bards are all chagrined at leastwise while the Queen is gone
But now she has returned so let's all hug and greet and fawn.
She left and things were gloomy, but she came back with the 'PING,
So now the bards are happy, so let's dance and clap and sing.

Oh, Gypsie left, but now she's back
She did not say good-bye or pack.
She doesn't know just where for sure,
but her name is Gypsie Zigeuner.

Her travels may have been quite wide.  Perhaps we'll never know
who she met, or what she did, for the booze affects her so.
But, when I saw her walk right in, triumphant in her splendor,
I hugged her fast, 'twas glad to see she'd survived this latest bender.

Her eyes are green, her hair is black
For loveliness she does not lack
But sobriety I'm not so sure,
And her name is Gypsie Zigeuner.

Oh, dear lady fair and fun and sweet and kind...
...and drunken
Born in a wagon, raised on the road, never know just where you'll be bunk'n.
Lady, please let somebody know next you choose to drink,
And bards, let's look out for the queen 'cuz she needs our help, I think.

Her eyes are green, her hair is black
For loveliness she does not lack
But sobriety I'm not so sure,
And her name is Gypsie Zigeuner.

She left and things were gloomy, but she came back with the 'PING,
So now the bards are happy so let's dance and clap and sing
Again her highness graces us with her presence and her style
Now we've her and 'PING and plus this bard's regained his smile.

Oh, Gypsie left, but now she's back
She did not say good-bye or pack
She doesn't know just where for sure,
but her name is Gypsie Zigeuner.
Her eyes are green, her hair is black
For loveliness she does not lack
But sobriety I'm not so sure,
And her name is Gypsy Zigeuner.


The Forgotten                   by:  Allandra Shadowfax 

'Round a corner quite dim
From history, 'tis wrought
Flam'd embers of memory
Of an empire once sought.
Sole left, the remains,
Of some once kingly blades;
Resting rusted in halls:
One dirk;  an old maul.

With capes cloaked in dust,
Upon finely carved thrones
Perch the shadows of kings
Wearing now dull'ed stones.
In one hallowed hall,
Fine tapestry-filled,
Linger songs of the ages:
A nightingale's trill.

Oh, woe, for the night
When the battles were fought;
When silver clashed silver
And shields held for nought.
The flash of a scimitar
On great fields of snow
As arrows and flame-throw'rs
Sped forth from each bow.

Where brave men stood tall,
Breathing ice at their foes,
Clutching scabbard and hilt,
Huddled shoulders 'gainst blows.
Oh, hear loud the shouts,
Ten thousand voice-howls,
The thunder of boots
And the sight of men's scowls.

For kingdoms and empires
Grow,  waver,  and fall;
Time passes for all men,
Both mighty, and small.
And once, by a chance,
In great halls of cut glass
You may stumble upon them,
Hear murmurs long-past.

Bow low, and remember,
With hushed honor grave,
The deeds of the worthy,
The glory of the brave.
For one day, some traveller,
Heart-weary, bone-tired,
May happen upon ye,
Your crown......likewise mired........

"The End of the Beginning"

The leaves, still wet with morning dew,
The sky, a slightly paler blue,
The world has seemed to start anew.

The sounds of roosters in the clear,
The sounds of battle drawing near,
The black of night whispers in your ear.

The soldiers never sheathe their swords,
And as you cry, you hear the words
Of old, forgotten, magick lords.

They tell you not to fear the end,
They tell you you can still begin,
And don't dwell on what might have been.

You see a light
Of astonishing sight,
And suddenly, you're free of fright!

You awaken,
Slightly shaken,
Glad that your soul wasn't taken.

You step aside,
Fears set aside,
As the last two soldiers...
...collide.
