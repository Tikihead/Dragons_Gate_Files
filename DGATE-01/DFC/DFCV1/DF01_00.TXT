-Hunting Etiquette
	by Milanden Sa'Kar



	As many of you may well know, I am a psycian hand cleric under Elindale.  I've made many accomplishments out of my physically inept racial qualities, and am ranked within the higher rankings; sandwiched in between leuians.  I've come to you in regards of hunting etiquette.
	Although hunting is one of the best parts about living in the  Spur, it is also the time to be respectful of those about you.  Everyone is trying to make a name for themselves, and everyone is looking for money to fill their pockets.  In efforts to allieviate the pains of bickering and arguing over who gets what, this simple list of hunting etiquette should suffice in the ways of courtesy and respect:

6.  Do not search after the kill until all monsters in the room are dead.
	-This will keep the room from overloading with creatures that will 	eventually overthrow you.  Also, the delay time you get when 	searching the monster will leave you open for some heavy shots.  In 	hunting parties, it gets harder to distinguish which creature to hit 	(the 5th wretch just changed to 4th wretch, etc.).
 
5.  If you enter a room where someone is attacking their monster-
	
	A) Don't jump in.  Ask first.
	B) If you decide to leave the room, either sleep dart it or confuse 	it or web it, etc.  If you can't do any of these things, either stay, 	or bring back the creature if it follows you out.
	C) By all means, don't start taking things in the room! This is 	viewed as thievery and questions won't be asked.  Most likely the 	owner of the room will start hammering on you.

4.  Don't heal any members of your party or any other adventurer unless asked to or you tell them beforehand that you are their cleric.
	-This is an important and overlooked courtesy.  Remember, everyone is 	trying to raise their skills, especially the first aid skill.  Again, 	unless they specifically ask to be healed, don't touch them.  Only 	exceptions for this rule is if the harmed person is a newbie or is 	down to "nearly unconscious."

(Editors Note: With the new rules governing the effectivness of First Aid, 
               instituted by the powers that be, I would say that healers 
               should feel free to heal anyone who is Pale, Ashen, or nearly 
               unconscious. Waiting any further may lead to the demise of 
               the one in need of the healing. If they object, than you can 
               let them fend for themselves...the ungrateful buggers,                                              Clerics need uses too you know. This has been an unsolicited 
               opinion. We know bring you back to your regularly scheduled 
               article. -Rags) 

3.  After searching of the monsters, don't start picking up the weapons.  (Hunting Parties Only)
	-Remember: Everyone wants their share.  It's best to leave it to the 	biggest guy in the room to be the pack 	mule and take all the 	weapons.  When the hunt is done, go to the bank, deposit the cash,  	then go to the curio. The big guy needs to deposit his cash so he 	doesn't end up splitting that with the money he'll get from the 	weapons. The big guy transacts, sells the weapons, and distributes 	the money evenly.  Also, there is nothing I hate worse than, "I 	killed this one! I get his stuff!"  Kill him/her on the spot is my 	advice. ;)

2.  When attacking, don't use just one letter to represent the monster you wish to attack. (i.e. ATTACK R)
	-This gets really frustrating, and I've lost many a familiar taking 	newbies out to hunt.  When you only use one letter to represent your 	victim, it leaves a multitude of choices for you to hit.  You could 	hit the rogue, Rudolph, the raven, etc.  Use at least three letters 	to help distinguish what you truly wish to hit.  If you end up 	killing someone else's familiar, offer to pay them back for their 	loss. <---and mean it!

1.  GOLDEN RULE:  Trust those that you are hunting with.  ;)
	-Don't just go out with anyone.  It might help to check the thief 	list with the WHO THIEF function, or look at what they are wielding, 	armor, etc.  See if they look like they can last in the place you 	wish to hunt.  More monsters come when more people are in the room.  	If your party dies quick, so will you.

                        Let the Games Begin
                               by
                          Acinonyx Aquilar

  If you can for a moment, try to imagine the Spur as it might have been several hundred years ago, not the busy city it is today, but something closer to a large trading outpost.  In the midst of a land wild, untamed, and for the most part, uncharted, a few bold pioneers looked to the Spur as a center of civilization, a place they called home.  From before sunup and well into the night, the residents of the Spur spent their waking hours exploring the unfamiliar territory and defending their new home from the savage creatures without.  

     As the months wore on, the populous found themselves in need of an outlet, something which would take their minds away from the dangers they faced day in and day out, something...fun.  There came an evening when a pair of notable Spurian citizens, Baal AkAar the Dragon and Nikoli Omakae the Muatana-al, put their minds together and came up with an idea which would provide a means for their fellow citizens to have some good, fun competition.  

     The basic idea was simple.  For a fee of 10,000 silver pieces per individual, a group of people battled each other in a designated area called the arena.  Spells, weapons, psionics, the use of familiars, and mesmerizing were all legal.  In fact, the only three things which were not legal were Holy intervention (prayers), the attacking of or with familiars, and leaving the arena.  The point of the game was to be the last one left standing.  Players were removed from combat when they were either killed or surrendered.  Once only one was person was left, the dead were resurrected, and the winner awarded a prize.  Half the entrance fee went towards resurrection and half to the prize.  The first ever of these games was held at the Anything Goes Club and the second at the Governor's mansion.  The idea was so popular, that the games were held each Saturday night.  This was the budding of what we now know as the Governor Games.

     Today, the tradition continues, and the Governor Games have become one of the most popular Spurian pastimes. Thanks to those earlier Spurian citizens and their persistence, we have a facility to use specifically for the games.  Every Saturday evening, the residents of our city--fighters, mages, clerics, Dragons, thieves, every class and race are usually represented--gather in the Green Room to participate.  Unlike the early days, however, the competitors may participate without a fee, and win or lose, each person who takes part in the event takes home a cash prize.

     Through the years, the games have progressed to become a very refined sporting event with a specific set of gaming rules and several different types of games.  I will cover both in the following section.

Governor Game Rules:

1.  Magick, weapons, psionics, webs, and the use of familiars is legal.
2.  No stealing, which includes pickpocketting, disarming, or stripping of bodies.
3.  No harmful prayers though helpful prayers are legal.
4.  No attacking of or with familiars.
5.  No departing.  If you are killed, report DEAD.  You will be removed from the arena and resurrected.  By departing, you risk the loss of your skills as well as your prize.
6.  No laying hands on opponents to hold them down.
7.  No unsportsmanlike conduct.  The games are made for people to have fun.  If you are attacked or die, do not use vulgar or abusive language or actions.

The Events:

Free-for-all -- 

     The free-for-all is almost the exact replica of the very first of the games, using the modern rules, of course.  In the free-for-all, it's you against everyone else.  However, it doesn't always work that way.  More often than not, small alliances are formed between combatants, each agreeing not to harm the other until everyone else has been eliminated (from experience, be very careful who you trust and how much you trust them).

Team Play --

     This is the most commonly seen of all the events.  All those who wish to take part gather in the Green Room.  Captains are then selected and begin the process of picking their teams and starting areas within the arena.  There are usually two to four teams, depending on the size of the crowd.  The winning team is the team with at least one member alive while no one from the other team(s) remain standing.

Cromarty Style --

     In the cromarty event, there are two teams, and the fighting lasts for thirty minutes straight.  If you die, your team loses five points, you are resurrected, and get sent back in.  Each kill you get, your team gets 10 points.  At the end, the fighting stops, and the count is figured to see who won.

Drag the Elder --

     This is the only one of the Governor's games that is not held within the arena and is quite different from the others.  Have you ever heard of capture the flag?  If so, you will see many similarities in Drag the Elder.  In this, ever participating Elder has a team.  In this game, the Elder is the equivalent to the flag.  The team first picks a spot in the realm to hide their Elder.  This spot becomes their base.  The object is to guard so that no one steals your Elder while at the same time trying to find the other team's Elder.  Once you've located another Elder, you drag it back to your base as fast as you can to win.


Governor Games Strategy:

Selecting Teams--

     Each person may have their own unique approach  to team selection, and it may depend on the event as to who your pick may be.  The strategy I will be describing is for the general version of the games.

     As many experienced gamers can attest, in this day and age, the runemages are a force to be reckoned with.  My first selection is from the experienced runemages, but even from among them, I have a specific method of selection.  I tend to take the runemages who have multiple abilities first (i.e. a Psycian who can confuse or a Frontacian who can drain).  Once the stronger runemages have been taken, I look for other Psycians.  Psycians can confuse runemages who are not using protective Magicks to defend against  mental attacks, thus rendering them vulnerable.  Once those choices are gone, I look for the stronger channeling Dragons.  Dragons have the combination of effective runes, decent spell resistance, and body armor.

     From the primary spells casters I move on to another choice, the Arachnians.  While they can't cast magick, they are incredibly resistant to it.  In addition, they have their special webbing ability, strong body armor, and are very effective with weapons.  So while the powerful runemage is fighting to cast a spell at them, they can be chopping the mage to pieces.  The only disadvantage is that in a long competition, they must use their webs sparingly as they take time to regenerate.

     If those choices are unavailable, I look for a well learned Sword or Heart Cleric as they both have effective runespells.  It is unfortunate at this time, but the Hand Clerics are sorely disadvantaged.  They do not have quick casting runespells, and at this point in time, deliver very little damage to their opponents.  Their best role is as a support unit for someone who does a lot of casting, particularly for Dragons who cannot pray for vigor.  After that, I look for a Leuian who is skilled at clawing or a heavily armored and hard swinging fighter.  A Leuian's claws are deadly and are, themselves, hard to hit, and a fighter can hit hard and take a beating.

     A lot of thought is involved in creating a good team.  If possible, it is good to have a mixture of talent types so your teams doesn't have any particular weakness.   Someone who is a friend or enemy outside the arena may be just the opposite during the games.



Fighting Tactics:

DEFENSE --

     As a Dragon, these tactics will be from a Dragon's point-of-view.  There are some hints which you can use, anything else, you may have to disregard.  However, I am both a rune and weapon's user, so  I can relate to both.  Prior to the start of the game, I cast and maintain three force magick auras on myself and one mental magick aura.  Why this ratio?  There are more runemages than there are Psycians.  Why three force magick auras?  Force magick aura is the spell that makes you resistant to magick.  It is also the spell which is dispelled from you most frequently.  If I used only one, I would be vulnerable if two runemages (or Dragons) ganged up on me--one to dispel the spell, the other to attack [Please note, in order to dispel a spell, you must have that spell already memorized].  

     For the most part, I do not use my armor aura as the combination of my armor and thick skin absorbs most physical damage, but if you are one who needs more physical protection, I would suggest using that spell.  It really depends on the individual.  I would strongly advise, however, that each combatant carries an extra set of armor with them in the event their current one should break.



OFFENSE

Spells--
 
     The most popular offensive spells are those which take the least amount of time to cast.  This gives the target less chance to run.  Fire fists seem to be among the more popular, unless you're a Frontacian runemage with the fatigue to cast several fire spheres.

Weapons--

     If you are a weapon's user, it is my best advice to use the most damaging weapon available to you.  Two-handed weapons are usually the most effective and are able to penetrate a mage's armor aura.  There was a time over two hundred years ago, when  the damage of spells was half of what it is today and weapon users were able to get several strokes in with a single exertion; but with the remarkable damage of today's runes and the decline in weapon's work, those who use melee weapons are at a considerable disadvantage.

Hiding and Dispelling--

     A very popular tactic, particularly for those who can pray hide, is to lurk in the shadows for a wandering, spelled up opponent and dispel their protections.  If the a person has a spell which you have memorized, you may dispel it by doing the following:  DISPEL <corridor or rune> <target>.  This takes some exertion and time on your part, but if you are hiding and do this, it will not reveal your location.  In addition, one shouild remember that not every attempt to dispel another persons spells  will be successful.

Targeting--

     A good team leader in the games is one who knows his or her opponents, both their strengths and weaknesses.  If I am in a group, I prefer to allow a non-magick user to lead the group as it frees me up so that I may cast my spells without having everyone wait for me.  My first targets are usually the Psycians.  Why?  Because there are fewer of them, yet they have their remarkably effective ability to confuse people.  Once they are gone, I no longer have to worry about maintaining my mental magick aura, and will save  that much more fatigue.

     Once the Psycian's are gone, I tend to target the low to mid-ranged runemages. While these guys probably can't kill  too many people with one spell, they can sneak a few spells in to do enough damage that could tip the balance away from you at the end.  Usually by this point, many of the weapons users have finished each other off or have been finished off by mages and only the ones who can either run or swing hard remain.

     Since physical attacks don't bother me too much, I am at this point, free to concentrate on the stronger casting mages.  This calls for quick thinking and reflexes as you need to keep your spells up, watch for those dispelling you, search rooms for those possibly hidden, and cast your spells off on them before they can get one off on you.  In these last few minutes of the game, first aid, energy, and quick feet will decide the winner.  One mistake and it could be your last.

Teamwork --

     In some cases, a good show of teamwork can decide the winners of a confrontation.  Not the entire team, but perhaps a two or three person combination.  A Dragon, Psycian, Arachnian combination for example would have a good chance of overtaking a lonely runemage.  A pair or trio of runemages (or Dragons) would work well as two of them can hide in the shadows and dispel those who come spelled up while the third one serves as a distraction and/or bait.

     The best way to learn your own specific strategies is to participate in the games and experiment.  Learn how others operate and what does or does not work for you, and what you can use to your advantage.  Don't be discouraged if you are one of those who is picked towards the end.  When the others get to know you better and you learn more about the games, that will change.

     It is said that the best competitor in the history of the combat events of the Governor Games was Nemesis Oblivion, the Ice Dragon, and the foremost authority and most consistent winner of the Drag the Elder Games was the Drake, Junor Lemmsjid.  Who is to say who the modern champions will be?  It is still too early to tell.  The runemages are and always will be quite powerful, but I believe in time, they will start feeling the pressures from the other classes and races.  With time, patience, good sportsmanship, and a will to learn, you will find that, win or lose you can have a good time and make some money while you're doing it.

Thoughts on the Great Games

by Lucia DeTalonart
     Leuian Fighter
     DragonMistress

Ah, the Games!  They're a good way to make money, to get to know fellow Spurians, and to die.  But with free rezzes, who's counting that?

Well, I was.  Just once, I wanted to stay alive past the first 5 minutes.  Being a simple fighter with no runes didn't help much. The fact that Leuians can't fly was also a detrimental factor.  Possessing 200+ HP's like the Monits and Thuggies would certainly add to life expectancy, but no such luck.  So, I asked myself, what's left?  Strategy!  We Leuians at least have a brain, don't we?

So, to test my theory, last night I jumped through the silvery portal and joined the Great Games.  Many brawny, nigh-invincible Spurians were there, as well as a couple of adventuresome souls new to the Spur.  (I smiled, recalling my first games as a newbie and the minute or so I managed to hang onto my life.)
[The narrator chuckles. Ah memories... She hums, then remembers she isn't a bard.]

After Kirstanel read us the rules (and the riot act for clowning around while he was explaining them), I was chosen to join the team of Acinonyx.  I also managed to file a few of my claws into pointy little daggers while I waited for the draft to wind its way down to me.  But that didn't bother me.  I had 'Strategy'! I was going to make my mark.

We entered the Games Grounds and separated, each team sent apart to plan its attack.  Acinonyx was absolutely overjoyed to find that we didn't have one high level magick-slinger among us.  Not to worry though!  We merely faced opposition like Ragarn, Gristle, Thistle and the like.  Simple!  (Ha!)  Well then... no access to cham web. OK.  (I knew that without my Strategy, I'd be dead in no time.)

Acinonyx and Miricas told our group to try to stay alive and swing at people.  My thoughts exactly.  We charged in!

That was the last I saw of Miricas.  He had said he believed our foes would try to overwhelm him early on.  I guess he was right and met an untimely, but doubtlessly heroic end.  I followed Acinonyx upstairs, along with a couple of other team members.  Acinonyx, large dragon that she is, paused once she got there.  (We Leuians are quick creatures you know--a brief blink of an eye to a hefty dragon can give us a night's sleep.)  So, seeing my chance when Aci paused, I snuck into hiding.  And stayed there.  Aci and company continued on north.  I sent my wolf around the battlefield, directing him from room to room, watching the action through his eyes from the safety of the shadows.

I was waiting for just one of the opposing team to unsuspectingly wander into my lair, someone I might have a chance of killing.  At one point, my teammate Delrin (only a week or so of Spurian experience under his belt but, none-the-less, filled with bravery) came into my room.  Out popped Ragarn from the shadows, and in the five seconds it takes for a Fire Sphere to form, Delrin was counted amongst the desceased. As Ragarn prayed to his God to return to the shadows, I chuckled to myself. If it weren't for Strategy, I'd be as dead as Delrin!

All along, there had been action updates broadcast by Kirstanel.  Over the distant sound of combat, I finally heard, "It's now down to just Acinonyx and Lucia! But where IS Lucia?"  Hiding for her life, that's where!  But I figured I was going to have to do something fairly soon.  Just then, in walks Saetine.  Now, I remembered when I first started seeing Saetine around town.  "Great!" I thought.  "He's fairly new.  Maybe I can take him out.  Besides, he's always trying to kiss me."  I decided I'd let him kiss my little black scimitar for a change.

I revealed myself, then started swinging!  Saetine stood there for a while as I pounded on him.  Obviously, I had managed to take him by surprise.  Then, I began to have big doubts.  I swung again.  And yet again.  Saetine laughed at me.  Saetine swung at me. WHAM!  I was dead in two swings.

So much for strategy.  I guess my next lesson is how not to under-estimate your opponent.  And that it's preferable to have Saetine kiss you than swing at you.

Well, it's certainly fun talking with all the other ghosts back in the holding tank.  I was whisked there just after Saetine cut me to ribbons with a mere flick of his sword.  But the good news?  There were already quite a few there since I had stayed hidden so long.  And as I always say, better the last ghost than the first!

What? You're asking about my title?  Well, it's simply that I'm an humble fighter who... Oh, not that one.  DragonMistress, hmm?  Well, that's a whole 'nother story in itself.
[Lucia grins slyly and goes into hiding.]

The Psyche of a Thief
by The One

  Another one was arrested today.  Its all over the papers.  "Boy Executed for String of Burglaries", "Thief Arrested after Peddle Scam".  Damn Thieves.  They're all the same.  Have you, in your conformist and intellectually devoid life, ever looked into the eyes of a Thief?  Ever wondered what made him function?  What shaped his existence?  What experiences might have molded his ways?  I am a Thief, welcome to my world...
  I live in a world that starts as a child with learning.  My parents, and even the occasional teacher has tried to 'educate' me.  I'm more intelligent than the average kid, this crap is boring and useless to me...
  
  Damn underachiever.  They're all the same...

  I'm in a merchants shop.  I'm being followed by the merchant everywhere I move.  "No sir, I didn't steal anything."
  
  Damn kid.  He's probably lying.  They're all the same...

  I'm in trouble again.  I don't understand why the things I do are so wrong.  These people never bother to look at their laws and rules and see that they're pointless and unnecessarily restricting.

  Damn kid.  He has to be different from everyone else.  They're all the same...

  I discovered something today...  I met a Thief.  This is great.  He accepts me for what I am.  If he gets angry with me, its because I messed up.  Not because he hates me.  Not because he's scared of me, or threatened by me.  Not because he thinks I'm a snotty punk, or because I'm young.

  Damn kid.  He can't stay out of trouble for 5 minutes.  They're all the same...

  Suddenly, I began to change.  A new way of life presented itself, and I was in a different world!  Rebellion flowing through my body like magic through a runemage... A spark of freedom, a place to get away from the monotony of life, a reality for myself.  "I like it here, I belong here..." I understand everyone, even if I have never met them, never seen them, or will never see them again.  I know all of them.

  Damn Thief.  Where did he go wrong?  They're all the same...

  You better believe we're all the same.  We've be shoved into a world where we're told what we believe and how to act...We've been given an ultimatum when we wanted freedom.  If we try to break away from the way we're supposed to be we're labeled criminals, and feral, and Thieves. We've been controlled by the conformists, and condemned by the conservatives.
  We live in our own world now.  The world of the discreet and cunning, the mentality of the Thief.  We use products and services that should be dirt-cheap, if it wasn't controlled by money-grubbing nobles, and you call us Thieves.  We explore, and you call us Thieves.  We hunger for information, and you call us Thieves.  Our world is one without notice of Race, Religion, or Belief.  You build weapons of destruction, you execute those who you don't understand, you cheat, you lie, and then say the we're the Thieves.
  Yes, I am a Thief!  My crime is taking advantage of the world the way it was intended to be.  My crime is judging someone by the way they think or act, and not how they survive, or what they look like or who they worship.  My crime is being more intelligent than you, something you cannot accept or forgive.  I am a thief, and I am proud of it.  You may stop one Thief, but you cannot stop us all.  You said it yourself, we're all the same...

  The One

Sites of Adventure: The Thieves Guild
By Chkkzrat Zzcharkk

  One of the most overlooked hunting grounds in the land is the vast 
complex that the thieves of the Spur call home.  It's no place for a 
recent arrival, as far too many young thieves can tell you, but offers the
perfect environment for the mid-level adventurer.  Even more experienced 
characters can find themselves challenged by it's many denizens and 
challenging geography.

  What follows is a guided tour of the Guild's layout from one 
Ttrrachkkichrrk, an Arachnian of some repute.  To get the most out of the 
tour you should have a copy of the excellent map available in the archives 
(theifgld.gif).  For purposes of brevity all redundant room descriptions 
and extraneous text has been removed from the transcript of the tour.  
A bestiary describing the creatures you're likely to encounter is also 
ncluded.

  We begin our journey at the Poor Quarter entrance to the Guild...

You are on the front stoop of the thieves' guild. Children and peasants 
mill about you. They have an unusually healthy look to them. Above the 
rune-covered door is the emblem of Set, the symbol of the guild.  An open 
wood door is here.
This area is illuminated.
Obvious paths: northeast*.

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "The entrance."

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "As you can see, the local residents are 
quite accepting of our activities and existence.  Many of them feel 
indebted to us because of the aid we provide."

Ttrrachkkichrrk  smiles at a ruddy-cheeked waif.

You follow Ttrrachkkichrrk through the door...

You are in the dimly lit entry hall. The door back outside is behind you. 
Sitting in the far corner is a thick-necked thug holding a spiked club you 
would swear is a tree limb with nails sticking out of it. There is a pair 
of alcoves on the far wall.  An open wood door is here.

This room is illuminated.
Obvious exits: None.

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "If Bruiser here isn't enough to 
discourage interlopers..."

(Ttrrachkkichrrk points to the well muscled thug.)

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "..there's a little surprise awaiting 
anyone who's not familiar with the entryway."

Ttrrachkkichrrk chuckles.

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "The first alcove is trapped and will 
send the idiot who uses it on a one way trip to the sewers."

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "With that in mind I think we'll go into 
the second alcove."

Ttrrachkkichrrk winks.

You follow Ttrrachkkichrrk through the second alcove...

You are in the rather busy guild reception hall. A sign over the 
receptionist's desk is opposite the alcove leading back out. Several doors 
and other passages exit further into the guild.  A wood sign, an open black 
steel door, an open grey wood door, and an open bronze door are here.

This room is illuminated.
Obvious exits: north south* west.

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "This is our main reception area.  
Occasionally the members give arrivals here a hard time."

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "All the administrative activities of 
the Guild are handled in this area."

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "This section of the complex dates back 
to the very earliest days of the city.  It was originally a chapterhouse 
for an order of monks dedicated to Set."

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "The artwork on the main door and 
throughout this area is from that period."

You follow Ttrrachkkichrrk through the first door....

This is the Room of Law, the door leads back out. You are quickly shuffled 
to an ornately carved table upon entering. The Keeper points to the booklet 
thereon and says, 'Learn it well if it is your desire to stay'. His face 
is pale and drawn.  An open black steel door and a booklet are here.

This room is illuminated.
Obvious exits: None.

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "Here we maintain the rules and 
regulations that mean so much to the Guild."

(Ttrrachkkichrrk points at the booklet.)

The booklet has nothing written on it.

Ttrrachkkichrrk chuckles.

You follow Ttrrachkkichrrk through the door...

(This brings us back into the reception hall.)

You follow Ttrrachkkichrrk through the second door...

This is the waiting room and you can see many people doing just 
that...waiting. Whether to see the guildmaster, the house mage, or one of 
the guild trainers, the hardwood benches ensure everyone's discomfort. A 
door leads back out.  An open grey wood door is here.

This room is illuminated.
Obvious exits: None.

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "This is where the good citizens of the 
Spur and our members wait when they wish to see one of our Masters."

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "It seems harmless, but you'd be 
surprised how big a body can fit under those benches."

You follow Ttrrachkkichrrk through the door...

(This brings us back into the reception hall once again.)

You follow Ttrrachkkichrrk through the third door...

Lushly furnished, this chamber serves the guildmaster. You get the strong 
feeling that you shouldn't be here without some very good reason. On the 
far wall, a large painting of the symbol of Set stands out boldly. A door 
leads back out.  An open bronze door is here.

This room is illuminated.
Obvious exits: None.

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "This is the demesne of our leader.  As 
you can see, we believe in living life to it's fullest."

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "What's the use of having money if you 
can't spend it, eh?"

Ttrrachkkichrrk chuckles.

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "The painting is an original Andorius, 
the famous Frontacian artist.  He went mad shortly after it's completion."

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "The tapestries are Arachnian originals 
from the Ttrrazzakkat webhold.  I'm in the process of importing some of 
the work of my creche mates from the Arkkata webhold."

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "You wouldn't be able to appreciate it, 
but the threads used to weave the tapestries actually tell the story of 
the scene depicted.  Our written language is a series of knots in each 
thread."

Ttrrachkkichrrk rubs his forearm along the weave of the tapestry.

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "Ahh..an adaptation of Recault the 
Scribe's epic poem of the defeat of Soros.  Timely, eh?"

Ttrrachkkichrrk chuckles.

You follow Ttrrachkkichrrk through the door...

(This brings us back into the reception hall once again.)

You follow Ttrrachkkichrrk south...

Trophies and mementos of great thieves, past and present, fill this large 
room. The King's crown graces several displays, which kind of makes you 
wonder a bit. You have the strangest feeling that someone, or something, is
watching your every move.

This room is illuminated.
Obvious exits: north*.

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "Here we honor the accomplishments of 
those rare Masters of the craft."

(Ttrrachkkichrrk gestures to the trophies lining the wall.)

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "Whether catpurse, thug, assassin, or 
thief we respect them all."

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "Personally, I enjoy the work of the 
great thieves.  They were able to slip into a home like a shadow.."

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "..lift the most well guarded coins and 
objects..."

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "..and then disappear into the night.  
That takes style."

You follow Ttrrachkkichrrk north...

(This returns us to the reception hall once again.)

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "Let's take a look at some of the 
training facilities."

You follow Ttrrachkkichrrk north...

You have entered a narrow, unlit hallway. To the north you can hear the 
faint sound of voices, maybe three of them. They seem to be discussing 
royalty. Strange.

This room is illuminated.
Obvious exits: north south*.

You follow Ttrrachkkichrrk north...

You are in a long, dark hallway. The walls are ornately carved of teak and 
rosewood, but for the life of you, you can't make out the design. The sound 
of voices drifts in from the north. It sounds oddly like counting lessons. 
A door is in the west wall.  An open wood door is here.

This room is illuminated.
Obvious exits: north* south*.

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "This beautiful woodwork was..donated...
by one of the previous Governors."

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "If you ever have a chance to be in his 
office take a close look at the walls."

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "You'll find they're newer replacements 
for older, much finer work."

Ttrrachkkichrrk chuckles.

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "These panels are the originals.  Very 
fine Hithual carving."

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "Now *that* was a heist!"

You follow Ttrrachkkichrrk through the door...

You are in the room belonging to the house mage. Shadows dancing about the 
rune-covered room send chills down your spine. Across from the door back 
out is a small shrine to Sa and a glowing portal. The mage isn't in right 
now.  An open wood door and a portal are here.

This room is illuminated.
Obvious exits: None.

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "This is where our membership receives 
instruction in the uses of..runes."

Ttrrachkkichrrk scowls.

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "I suppose some of them need to use such 
things."

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "They learn the runes elsewhere, but 
it's here that they learn our techniques for using them."

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "You'd be surprised what some of the 
more esoteric combinations can do."

(Ttrrachkkichrrk looks around to make sure no one is watching.)

(Ttrrachkkichrrk tips over a few of the alembics and vials sitting on the 
counter.)

Ttrrachkkichrrk snickers.

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "I and the house mage don't get along."

Ttrrachkkichrrk touches a portal.

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "This is simply another of our escape 
routes.  In case those dolts in the guardhouse decide to get feisty again."

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "It leads to the temple of SA in the 
temple district.  Nice place that.  I love the decor there."

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "Not nearly as pleasant as the fittings 
at Taath's glorious edifice, but not bad."

You follow Ttrrachkkichrrk through the door...

(This brings us back into the hallway running north from the reception 
hall.)

You follow Ttrrachkkichrrk north...

The hallway ends before three doors. Each is distinctly carved with 
patterns that make no sense whatsoever. A couple of guards straighten up 
from their card game which you appear to have interrupted. They don't look 
pleased.  An open door, an open door, and an open door are here.

This room is illuminated.
Obvious exits: south*.

(Ttrrachkkichrrk gestures to the patterns on the doors.)

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "The old form of written Caneer, our 
Guild tongue."

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "Very beautiful, actually."

You follow Ttrrachkkichrrk through the door...

This is a now deserted trainer's quarters. The memories of she who once
dwelt here have dimmed as time passed. (Especially the ones of her brutal 
death.) Legend has it that she will return one day. A door leads back out 
to the hallway.  An open door is here.

This room is illuminated.
Obvious exits: None.

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "This room is maintained in honor of one 
long gone."

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "In her day she was something to behold."

Ttrrachkkichrrk sighs.

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "She is missed, but they say that 
perhaps she can return to us."

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "So we keep her second home ready."

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "I just hope she has better control of 
her temper this time around."

Ttrrachkkichrrk snickers.

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "She was always losing her head."

You follow Ttrrachkkichrrk through the door...

(This returns us to the intersection at the end of the hallway.)

You follow Ttrrachkkichrrk through the second door...

This is the room of the trainer, Nate the Quick, the fastest thief in the 
guild. As befits the owner, the room is sparsely furnished. He always 
travels lightly. Several pieces of dubious literature grace an end table 
to one side. A door leads back out.  An open door is here.

This room is illuminated.
Obvious exits: None.

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "Hmmm..too bad Nate isn't here."

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "He'd be a good one for you to talk to."

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "This is where he trains the membership 
in the dark arts of thievery.  He's a very good instructor, but you should 
have seen him in his prime."

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "His nickname comes from the time he 
grabbed an elfin arrow right out of the air.  Needless to say, the elf was 
quite surprised."

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "I think Nate even keeps that elf's head 
around here somewhere."

(Ttrrachkkichrrk rummages around a bit.)

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "Ah well, guess that will have to wait 
for another time."

You follow Ttrrachkkichrrk through the door...

(This returns us to the intersection.)

You follow Ttrrachkkichrrk through the third door...

This room belongs to the trainer, Slippery Slone. He is renown for his 
silent movement and hiding techniques, both of which he teaches. The room 
appears empty at the moment. The door leads back out to the hallway.  An 
open door is here.

This room is illuminated.
You see the 1st rogue.
Obvious exits: None.

Ttrrachkkichrrk searches the room thoroughly.

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "Slippery?"

Ttrrachkkichrrk shrugs.

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "You never know when he's actually out 
or when he's just hiding in the shadows."

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "He trains the membership in the arts of 
stealth."

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "Guess he isn't here after all."

Ttrrachkkichrrk turns, and you notice what appeared to be a coat hanging 
on a rack flash a smile at you.

You follow Ttrrachkkichrrk through the door...

(This brings us back once again to the intersection.  We traveled south 
down the hallway and returned to the reception hall.)

You follow Ttrrachkkichrrk west...

You are at the top of a descending stairway. From below drift some strange 
and exotic scents. Briefly you are reminded of various foods and...is it 
something else? Have you been here before?  A stairs is here.

This room is illuminated.
Obvious exits: east*.

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "As you can tell, we have cooking 
facilities downstairs.  I think you'll be surprised by the quality of the 
fare."

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "This is where the old chapterhouse used 
to end.  Down the stairs is a newer level excavated at the same time the 
city sewer system was being built."

You follow Ttrrachkkichrrk through the stairs...

You are at an intersection formed by a hallway and the bottom of the 
stairwell. To the west is a bar, loud and welcoming. There is a foul smell 
coming from the east which is an easy clue to its purpose. A sign is posted
by the north hallway.  A stairs and a wood sign are here.

This area is illuminated.
Obvious paths: north east west*.

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "This is the second level of our complex.
This area is dedicated to keeping the membership happy."

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "Food, rest, supplies, and companionship 
can all be found here."

You follow Ttrrachkkichrrk west...

This is the (in)famous Thieves' Bar, where everyone who is anyone, to the 
guild anyway, can be found from time to time. There is a bar and grill to 
the south and seating to the north. Someone calls out a greeting as you 
enter...as everyone enters.

This area is illuminated.
Obvious paths: north* east* south*.

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "We in the Guild believe in meeting all 
the needs of our membership."

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "That includes making sure they get 
decent meals."

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "Many of them come from humble roots and 
don't eat nearly as well as they should."

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "Others of course enjoy the finer things 
in life.  You'll find food items here that you can't find anywhere else."

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "Mainly because we heisted them before 
they could get there."

Ttrrachkkichrrk chuckles.

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "You wouldn't believe the wine cellar 
that the Guildmaster has.  Truly astonishing what's been misplaced over the
years by the local wine merchants."

Ttrrachkkichrrk winks.

You follow Ttrrachkkichrrk south...
 
Here is the bar and grill where thieves come to wet their whistle and 
satisfy their hunger. You are quite pleased by the quantity and quality of
the service. Members of all races and sexes stand about to 'help' you with 
your meal...and maybe later, too.  A wood bar is here.

This area is illuminated.
Obvious paths: north*.

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "As you can see, we're quite egalitarian.
 All are treated equally regardless of race or sex."

You follow Ttrrachkkichrrk north...

(This brings us back to the entrance to the Bar)

You follow Ttrrachkkichrrk north...

Here the tallest tales, the shadiest deals, and the best information can be 
swapped. Many lucrative schemes have been transformed into bulging purses 
for those with the forethought to come here first. Planning is everything.

This area is illuminated.
Obvious paths: north* south*.

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "Here is where many of the greatest 
plots every hatched started."

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "It's also one of the few places in the 
Spur where you can get vincarne, the delightful flesh wine brewed by my 
kind."

You follow Ttrrachkkichrrk north...

You are in the game room of the thieves' guild. Games such as Slam Cup, 
Catch The Knife, Silvers and the old Shell Game are played here with fervor 
and skill. Some games are even fair! See how friendly the thieves about you 
look?

This area is illuminated.
Obvious paths: south*.

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "I wouldn't advise playing any of the 
games."

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "We train some of the best street 
gamblers in the world right here in this room."

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "Keep that in mind the next time you see 
someone set up a game on some streetcorner."

You follow Ttrrachkkichrrk south...

You follow Ttrrachkkichrrk south...

You follow Ttrrachkkichrrk east...

(This brings us back to the intersection at the bottom of the stairs.)

You follow Ttrrachkkichrrk north...

You are in a featureless hallway. To the north are the rooms of the little 
sisters while the east and south lead to stairways. The echoes of laughter 
float past you, but you are unable to trace their origin.

This area is illuminated.
Obvious paths: north east south*.

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "As I said, the Guild believes in 
meeting the needs of it's membership."

Ttrrachkkichrrk chuckles.

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "All their needs."

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "The little sisters are here to provide 
comfort, in all it's forms, to them."

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "This area also serves as a training
ground for some of the finest courtesans in Spur.   Oftentimes a pretty 
face can gain us more information than a sharpened dirk."

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "Why don't you stop by the guard 
barracks when we're done here and ask Captain Greatholme how he met his 
wife."

Ttrrachkkichrrk winks.

You follow Ttrrachkkichrrk north...

The open doorways to the west and north each lead to a room of the little 
sisters. The door to the east also leads to another. Many a thief looks 
forward to his visits down here from the tales you have heard.  An open 
wood door is here.

This area is illuminated.
Obvious paths: north* south* west*.

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "Welcome to the gateway to paradise."

You follow Ttrrachkkichrrk west...

You have entered the room of the first little sister. You feel oddly at 
peace. After a short while here, you are well rested and ready to take on 
most any task.

This area is illuminated.
Obvious paths: east*.

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "After a short while you feel rested.  
Give her about three hours and you won't be able to move.  There are also 
"brothers" for the female membership."

You follow Ttrrachkkichrrk east...

(This brings us back to the intersection)

You follow Ttrrachkkichrrk north...

This small room is filled with cots that can be rented. Guild law, both 
written and unwritten, guarantees the safety of those who sleep here. A 
small sign tells how this can be arranged for newcomers. Simply lying down 
makes you feel better as well.  A wood sign is here.

This area is illuminated.
Obvious paths: south*.

(Ttrrachkkichrrk gestures towards the sign.)

The wood sign reads:
"NOTICE:
Cots rented by the day or week.
     See the Receptionist"

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "This place serves as a home for those 
without a home."

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "Many people don't realize that the 
Guild performs many of the good works traditionally reserved for the more 
established charity organizations."

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "It's really a shame folks can't see all 
the positive things we do."

Ttrrachkkichrrk sighs.

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "Instead they choose to dwell on the 
negative."

You follow Ttrrachkkichrrk south...

(This brings us back to the intersection yet again.)

You follow Ttrrachkkichrrk through the door...

One of the little sisters is running the Thieving Specialty Shoppe here. 
Many tools of the trade can be bought, or the hard won 'fruits of victory' 
can be sold here at prices that are very reasonable indeed.  An open wood 
door is here.

This area is illuminated.
Obvious paths: None.

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "This establishment is where items can 
be fenced."

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "Anything that would be accepted at the 
pawn shop in the city is accepted here.  Makes it easier on the members 
that don't want to show their faces up top."

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "We also sell a variety of items that 
can be found nowhere else. The products from our importing business."

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "We have a very active group of 
procurers working at the docks.  Whenever they see something interesting 
they pass it along to us."

You follow Ttrrachkkichrrk through the door...

(This brings us back to the intersection yet again.)

You follow Ttrrachkkichrrk south...

You follow Ttrrachkkichrrk south...

You are in a featureless hallway. To the north are the rooms of the little
sisters while the east and south lead to stairways. The echoes of laughter 
float past you, but you are unable to trace their origin.

This area is illuminated.
Obvious paths: north* east south.

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "Let's go take a look at some of the 
finest stonework in the world.  This section we're about to enter is over 
fifty feet below the surface.

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "Normally that would make air 
circulation a problem, but the Hithual that built the tunnels were masters 
of their craft."

You follow Ttrrachkkichrrk east...

You are at a bend in the hallway. Even if there was a regular light 
source, this corner would still be dark and dingy. To the north is a 
forbidding stairway leading down while to the west is an intersection of 
some sort.

This area is illuminated.
Obvious paths: north west*.

You follow Ttrrachkkichrrk north...

Looking down the dark stairway before you brings to mind all the better 
ideas you've ever had. It descends into a dark and silent void. Are you 
quite sure you want to go down?  A stairs is here.

This area is illuminated.
Obvious paths: south*.

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "This is where we enter the deepest part 
of the complex."

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "The Guild hired some of the work crews 
that designed and built the sewers to excavate these facilities at the 
same time."

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "On some of the original plans these 
rooms are marked as cisterns and overflow chambers."

You follow Ttrrachkkichrrk through the stair...

Darkness surrounds you. An opening of some sort leads off to the north 
while the stairs head back up and also continue further down. Only silence 
calls out from either direction the stairs run.  A stairs and a stairs are 
here.

This area is illuminated.
 Obvious paths: north.

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "Remember this area well.  The stairways 
can make it confusing to navigate.  Of course, that's what they were 
designed to do."

Ttrrachkkichrrk chuckles.

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "The first set of stairs here will take 
you back the way we just came."

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "The second set of stairs takes you to 
the section of the complex that adjoins the sewers."

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "Let me show you some of our..
accomodations.  The Arena is this way as well.

You follow Ttrrachkkichrrk north...

The north-south passage is joined by one coming in from the east at this 
point. Noise drifts in from the north, ringing off the stone walls about 
you. As you glance up, a small drop of water hits your eye after falling 
from the ceiling.

This area is illuminated.
 Obvious paths: north east south*.

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "There are natural springs scattered 
underneath the city.  That's where this water comes from.  They're 
responsible for the great dark lake as well."

You follow Ttrrachkkichrrk north...

You are in the stands which overlook the Octagon, the guild arena. The 
name comes from its eight-sided sand pit. Here crowds cheer on their 
favorites while betting is carried out under the careful guidance of the 
guild officials. Stairs head down.  A stairs is here.

This area is illuminated.
 Obvious paths: south*.

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "This is our private arena."

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "It serves as a tool for both training 
and discipline.  Fighters are able to hone their skills while punishing 
those that have offended the guild."

You follow Ttrrachkkichrrk through the stairs...

This is where contestants and animals are prepared for their so-called 
wrestling matches. Sharpening teeth and claws usually helps little against 
the animals, but the thieves will keep trying anyway.  A stairs is here.

This area is illuminated.
 Obvious paths: east west*.

Ttrrachkkichrrk smiles at the equipment scattered about.

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "I fought here myself in my younger
days."

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "Many of the best trainers from the 
city Arena come here to recruit new gladiators and develop tactics."

You follow Ttrrachkkichrrk east...

This is the guild's arena. Here the guild helps its members hone their 
combat skills against a wide variety of nasty critters. Bets are placed on 
almost every match.

This area is illuminated.
 Obvious paths: west*.

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "The Octagon.  A place of blood, sweat, 
skill, and honor."

Ttrrachkkichrrk bows.

You follow Ttrrachkkichrrk west...

(This brings us back to the preparation area.)

You follow Ttrrachkkichrrk west...

You have entered the guild dungeon. Held sometimes indefinitely, those 
without substantial means and under suspicion of violating guild rules find 
themselves here. The various doors are securely locked and barred.  A 
closed iron door, a closed iron door, and a closed iron door are here.

This area is illuminated.
Obvious paths: east*.

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "This is the holding area for those 
under suspicion of betraying the Guild."

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "If they are found innocent they are 
free to go.  If they are guilty it's off to the Octagon with them."

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "Our justice is harsh, but fair.  Few 
complain about it."

(Ttrrachkkichrrk gestures at the three doors.)

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "These are cells for the accused.  They 
are rarely occupied for long."

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "I doubt you would want to spend much 
time in them anyway."

Ttrrachkkichrrk chuckles.

You follow Ttrrachkkichrrk east...

(This returns us to the preparation room again.)

You follow Ttrrachkkichrrk through the stairs...

(This brings us back to the stands overlooking the Octagon.)

You follow Ttrrachkkichrrk south...

The north-south passage is joined by one coming in from the east at this 
point. Noise drifts in from the north, ringing off the stone walls about 
you. As you glance up, a small drop of water hits your eye after falling 
from the ceiling.

This area is illuminated.
 Obvious paths: north* east south.

You follow Ttrrachkkichrrk east...

This sleeping room is for those unlucky enough to have failed in their 
plans of thievery. Those who cannot afford the services of the little 
sisters come here instead. An old story teller lives here as well.

This area is illuminated.
 Obvious paths: east* west*.

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "Here you see another of the services 
provided by the Guild.  No member is ever without a home."

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "Do you see the other Guild's providing 
such worthy charity?"

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "Does the Pride, or the Council of 
Dragons?"

Ttrrachkkichrrk shakes his head from side to side.

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "But they say we are the bad ones."

You follow Ttrrachkkichrrk east...

You are in the far end of the guild dorm room. There are far more sleeping 
individuals here than near the entrance to the west. A sleight-of-hand 
artist practices his trade on a far bunk.

This area is illuminated.
 Obvious paths: west*.

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "We even allow the orphan children of 
the city to dwell here under our protection.  We teach them a trade, feed 
them, and give them a family."

You follow Ttrrachkkichrrk west...

You follow Ttrrachkkichrrk west....

(This brings us back to the three way intersection.)

You follow Ttrrachkkichrrk south...

Darkness surrounds you. An opening of some sort leads off to the north 
while the stairs head back up and also continue further down. Only silence 
calls out from either direction the stairs run.  A stairs and a stairs are 
here.

This area is illuminated.
 Obvious paths: north*.

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "We take the route leading to the sewer 
system this time."

You follow Ttrrachkkichrrk through the second stair...

You are at the bottom landing of a grim stairway. It stretches up into the 
darkness in relative silence, the water dripping down the walls is all that 
disturbs it. An equally dark passage leads off to the north.  A stairs is 
here.

This area is illuminated.
 Obvious paths: north.

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "This entire area was carved from the 
soft volcanic stone of the island."

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "In many cases, as in my homeland in the 
Wastes, volcanic rock is amongst the hardest in the world."

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "But the Spur was built upon the remains 
of a collapsed plug of ancient ash and pumice.  The resulting stone is 
resilient, but soft."

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "You'll also notice spots lined with 
the yellow baked clay bricks of the southlands.  These are sections of the 
tunnels that had to be watertight."

You follow Ttrrachkkichrrk north...

This dark hallway has a small passage leading off to the west. The stone about you is cool and damp to the touch, a drop of water occasionally falls from the ceiling, splattering on you or the floor.

This area is illuminated.
 Obvious paths: north south* west*.

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "Take care that you keep your sense of direction.  This section of tunnel is often confused with the section leading to the Arena by recent arrivals."

You follow Ttrrachkkichrrk west...

This huge chamber is filled with all manner of mundane supplies. Sacks and chests of food, barrels of potable water, shelves filled with everything imaginable. Even the numerous guards are generously equipped with all the latest equipment.

This area is illuminated.
 Obvious paths: east*.

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "You'll notice that we have enough supplies to last us years."

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "In case the city is ever subject to a blockade we will be able to weather it unscathed."

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "It's not unknown for such actions to also inflate the worth of basic supplies.  It seems only fair that those who were prepared get some recompense for their vision."

You follow Ttrrachkkichrrk east...

(This brings us back to the three way intersection.)

You follow Ttrrachkkichrrk north...

This dark hallway brightens slightly to the north, its crudely carved walls are unadorned of even the simplest designs. The floor has yet to be worn smooth from usage so the occasional stumble can be expected.

This area is illuminated.
 Obvious paths: north* south*.

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "Watch your footing, this section was just rebuilt.  The constant tremors and erosion caused by the water took quite a toll."

You follow Ttrrachkkichrrk north...

In one wall is set a door which seems to be in amazingly good repair. The hinges look freshly oiled, the wood firm and new. Carved over the door in many tongues is a single word; 'SEWERS'. Usually this door is heavily guarded.  An open wood door is here.

This area is illuminated.
 Obvious paths: south*.

(Ttrrachkkichrrk gestures at the door.)

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "Give you one guess where that door leads."

Ttrrachkkichrrk chuckles.

You follow Ttrrachkkichrrk through the door...

This small room has two doors. One leads into the depths of the Thieves' Guild, the other out to the sewers. Members are expected to change before tracking sewer slime all over the guild.  An open wood door, an open iron door, and a wood sign are here.

This area is illuminated.
 Obvious paths: None.

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "Going through the first door will take us back into the Guild."

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "We'll be returning that way in just a moment, but for now..."

You follow Ttrrachkkichrrk through the second door....

This room is filled with benches and short partitions, offering a sort of communal privacy. It reminds you of a large changing room. A plain door is set in one wall while there is a dark hole in the wall opposite it.  An open iron door and a hole are here.

This area is illuminated.
 Obvious paths: None.

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "This is the changing room."

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "The sewer network provides us with a way to rapidly move throughout the city without being seen."

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "Unfortunately, sewers are filled with...muck...that is terribly unsightly.  This is where our agents change after arriving from the flowpipes."

(Ttrrachkkichrrk gestures towards the hole.)

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "That leads directly into the pipes.  From it you can be anywhere in the city in just a matter of seconds."

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "And it is here that I must regretfully end our journey together."

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "I hope you've found our hospitality pleasurable.  We're pleased to let everyone know exactly what the Guild is like."

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "Then again, maybe this isn't the real Guild at all."

Ttrrachkkichrrk laughs.

Ttrrachkkichrrk says in Arachnian, "But do you really think we could be that devious?"


Thieves Guild Bestiary
     The guild is home to an interesting mix of creatures and beasts.  The distribution of critters throughout the complex seems random, but the Octagon contains the same creatures you would find in the Arena.  Here's what you can expect to face.

Amateur gladiator- The Octagon's version of the rogue, but with more hit points.  Treat them the same.

Assassin- Nasty hombres.  They hit pretty often and can cause some surprising amounts of damage.  

Battle cat- Strong attacks, but doesn't have the hit frequency or hit points that would make them truly monstrous.  Octagon only.

Dog- Leave it alone and it'll leave you alone.  Some nasty attacks.  Easy for groups to defeat, but can be troublesome for individuals.

Fire lizard-  Slightly more powerful than an ice lizard.  Regenerative abilities make them even more difficult to kill.  Octagon only.

Giant rat- Can take lots of hits, but don't deal out too much damage.  Can swarm.

Hound- Won't attack unless provoked.  Slightly weaker than a dog.

Ice lizard- Has some strong attacks and regenerates.  Takes forever to kill.  Octagon only.

Killer rat- Aptly named.  Bite is powerful and capable of piercing even heavy armor.  Use extreme caution.  Octagon only.

Mugger- Same beastie as you'll find in town.  The ones with wood clubs are handled pretty easily, but when they're armed with hammers or axes you can run into trouble.

Old rogue-  A rogue with some experience.  Only slightly more difficult than the younger variety.

Old thief- Potentially deadly.  Hit as often as the younger variety, but cause considerably more damage.  Must get stronger as they age.

Professional gladiator- Tough.  The ones armed with bastard swords and pikes are lethal.  Can soak up a lot of damage.  Octagon only.

Rabid Dog- The bad boys of the canine family.  A devastating bite combined with slightly more hitting ability than a dog.  Watch out for packs. 

Rooster- Mean.  Very mean.  It's pretty embarrassing to be killed by a chicken, but they're capable of doing it with frightening regularity.  Use caution.  Only found in Octagon.

Rogue-  Everyone's favorite punching bag.  Only moderately difficult, but they do swarm so watch out.

Thug- Just under a rogue in difficulty.  Bonkable.

Thief- They spent all their time in thieves school studying breaking and entering, to the detriment of their weapon skills.  Don't hit too hard, but they do hit often.

Ttrrachkkichrrk-  Avoid.  Foul tempered.  Can cut you to ribbons and has a web attack that immobilizes victims.  Best to offer him gold to leave you alone.

War dog- They can have a tough time hitting you, but when they do you'll know it.  Bite attack is devastating.  Octagon only.

A Hunter's Dream	(AOL name:Sunshield1)

Hunter's blade and shield,
Before them he kneeled.
He'd take them to battle,
To be slaughtered like cattle.

At home his family awaits,
Behind the stone of castle gates.
Would their hunter return?
Or would there be,
Another funeral pyre to burn?

Oh glory, fortune, and fame!
His life never the same.
As time passes as a stream,
So does the Hunter's Dream.
	
Saddened eyes look ever on
For the hunter has surely gone.
Into battle and die for glory,
His tale would be told,
In many a story.

But on the horizon they see,
Their hunter-born on wounded knee.
He hath returned to his home.
His epic death for another tome!

Oh glory, fortune, and fame!
His life never the same.
As time passes as a stream,
So does the Hunter's Dream.

                        ***SOCIETY COLUMN***      

Byline: Allandra Shadowfax,  Psycian Heart Cleric

A hush fell over the audience as they listened to the rhythmic, hypnotic words. 
 
No, it isn't a group chant at your friendly neighbourhood temple.  This scene is from the first Bardic Recital at Bard's Hall, sponsored by the Leuian Guild.  For those who missed the glittering event, you have much to look forward to in the coming weeks.  Astounding poetic talent, cash prizes, door prizes, and an insider's view at the new designer collections by REHAS INC.  (modelled by yours truly).   

The first gala sponsored two competitions:   PREPARED ENTRIES by Spur's 
illustrious poets, and 'SPUR OF THE MOMENT',  a fun but nerve-wracking 
creation of instant verse on a topic chosen by the Mistress of Ceremonies.  I'm glad I wasn't one of the judges  --  the competition was fierce.  First place in the PREPARED ENTRIES segment at this first of firsts went to Thistleroot.   A close   Second place was taken by Lantine.

Ragarn captured a landslide First Place in SPUR OF THE MOMENT for the topic 
'Chivalry',  with Thistleroot again placing in the finals as Second.

I would be remiss if I didn't congratulate Skratchnar Mistoffeles and Mister, both of whom disqualified themselves for a conflict of interest, yet would have taken hefty prizes for their poetic presentations otherwise.

Special thanks is also in order to Skratchnar, without whose patronage, 
planning, and support this event could not have taken place.  Thank you, 
Skratchnar. 

All participants dazzled the audience with their contributions, and I look 
forward to many more enchanted nights.  So get out your quills, inks, and scrolls and head over to the Guild for the next Bardic Recital.  Watch for it in the Events Calendar.  And I'll join you there as the Mistress of Ceremonies.


ON A LIGHTER NOTE

Has anyone else seen the two lovey-dovey Oog-ras walking hand in hand on 
moonlit nights in the Arena area?   No?   Well, watch for that story in my next column.   Spicy details to come.

Till next time, Allandra

                               Rumors

A new Spurian enterprise has hit town, and it's sure to make money for the founder. Bonebreaker Tours is the name, and giving guided trips around the Lands is its game. Gristle Bonebreaker apparently loves showing new players around so much that he decided to make a business out of it. Reportedly, his favorite customers are Secians who giggle a lot.

Our top story this issue is the wedding of Suki Tawdry and Skracthnar Misstofelles. Marriage vows were exchanged on Thursday in the beautiful ceremony of Khat'sara. Friends of the couple, which include many of the Spur's Ressurectionists, celebrated with the happy pair at the Grand Royale. Everyone was treated to a beautiful banquet, including seafood platters and KhatNip Champagne.

Speaking of Rezzers, a new and very disturbing trend is making itself felt in our fair city and the surrounding environs. Apparently, some people are not honoring their debts to the Clerics who bring them back from that bleakest of realms. There is talk of a "blacklist" being circulated, listing the deadbeats, in order to restore the proper respect to these Priests and Priestesses. All who make the list for not paying the now standard 20,000 silver fee will apparently be denied rezzing by all.

A certain Secian was asked by a certain Dragon to be his Bondmate. The Secian, known for his wild and maverick attitude, apparently took offense at the mere suggestion. The little one, in a very un-Secian-like move, Sleep Darted the poor repilte and proceeded to strip him bare. The Dragon was last heard saying, "Don't give me your answer now. Think on it!"

The stresses of running the day to day activities of the Dragon Council seem to have reached Acinonyx.  While this dragon was known to have displayed remarkable skill and patience in dealing with newbies in the past, lately, a darker side of the Golden One has come out and newbies should beware of her razor sharp bone sword before approaching her with too many consecutive questions.

Gavin the Thief, the most eligable, if not the richest, bachelor in the Spur has announced a "Win a Date with Gavin Contest". The lucky lady will be chosen by a panel of Arachnian Judges, and will win a nite on the Spur with the small but plucky Rogue. You can contact Gavin using ESP during daytime hours, and please remember, he's a "bad boy"! (The preceeding was a paid advertisment sponsored by Gavin Swordsbane)

A certain San Elf by the name of Kilmaron is said to have had his heart broken, as the lovely Kalaa seems to have moved on to bigger and better things. A master/slave relationship like this one doesn't come along very often, and we are all pulling for this couple to have a happy ending.

The head Khat of the Hand Clerics, Lorelei Nilsfulcentruali, was recently seen leaving Aloysious tent in a manic, Khatnip-like craze. Seems that she was told a certain reptile would be giving her a very special Rinnamas present that had been bought just before she had a chance to chat with the Merchant Mage. The reptile has yet to have the item charged, but when he does, we can be sure Lorelei will be bouncing around the Spur, showing it off. No word on what it is, or who the Dragon is. But this reporter has managed to learn that ARRRG IMADRAGON was seen very soon after, asking directions to a place where "large gems" of a certain caliber can be found.

Sant'a came to town to celebrate Rinnamas Eve and the Spurian tour leader, Gristle Bonebreaker, was magically transformed into a GRINCH that stole the Rinnamus tree in the town Square.  A number of the spur's finest tracked him down and got the tree back, and all left standing were treated to several presents tossed out by Sant'a and his elder helpers. The hottest item given out? Why the ticklemeJaxie doll of course!  With a real lace outfit this replica of everyone's favorite elder made many a flerian's dreams come true that night . . .

There are rumors of a series of Taathian built tunnels through out the spur.  While we haven't seen them, everyone is openly encouraged to use them for mass transport -- provided you have a good rezzer around if they catch you.

Ferragus the elder has been spotted bleating in the town square, we're not sure if Soros is behind it but it certainly is worth mentioning.

Awards:

Thief of the Week: Smileface. Killed at least 24 times in one weekend alone by angry victims.  There's a on-going pool of who gets dibs on the caracss when his 30 days are up.

The "Please stop" Award: ARRRG IMADRAGON for  continuing to use ESP to contact everyone when a dear departed dragon needs a rezzer.  To ARRRG -- take one of your own clue cards and contact a rezzer directly next time as we all have headaches!

Most Likely to Win:  Mystress the Secian and Kallamar the Dragon in the upcoming New Year's Eve Kissing Contest. This couple has spent many a quiet moment practicing for the event in the town square, in the haunted house, in the graveyard, in the guild halls, in the Curio Corner, and just about everywhere else. .

Rise of the Classes

Welcome to "The Rise of the Classes."  In previous issues the top five and top ten of each class were brought to you.  From this issue on we will review only two classes at a time, but with the top 30 of each class.  In this issue, we will take a look at two classes with honed fighting skills as we examine the Clerics of the Hand and the Barbarians.  I would like to welcome those in positions 11-30 of both classes to the Rise of the Classes.

What's happening here?  The Barbarians have gone completely topsy-turvy, with only one person holding the same position since last issue.  Five newcomers enter the top ten, including Smakem who has usurped the spot of Guildmaster from Worf who has fallen to number 2.  The others who are new to the top ten are Sensuous, Talor, Reave, and Magoth, holding spots 3, 5, 6, and 9 respectively.  Only two from last issue's top ten have not fallen.  Mar (4) and Tralizar (8) continue to hold on to the same spots they had before.  What's happen to Modi and Brizza?  They have dropped from the 2 and 3 spots to 7 and 10, respectively, and I do not believe either has been seen in the realm since last issue.

1: Smakem Realhard the Thugian 
2: Worf Hellbringer the Arachnian  
3: Sensuous Helbringer the Arachnian  
4: Mar Slarslthsla the Monitanian 
5: Talor Schlort the Thugian  
6: Reave Trollblood the Thugian 
7: Modi Nailbearer the Monitanian  
8: Tralizar Faldoran the Hithual
9: Magoth Durr the Oog-ra  
10: Brizza Whiplasher the Arachnian 
11: Gokuo YamchaSan the Thugian 
12: Sorin Gilgorath the Hithual 
13: Cheetahlord Renegade the Hithual 
14: Casius Canthiar the Thugian  
15: Traegue Oleran the Thugian 
16: Demesne Tome the Thugian  
17: Razzor Deathfist the Thugian 
18: Andex Corlione the Hithual 
19: Lizalia Eliza the Monitanian  
20: Huntur Ratatoskr the Go-blin-al  
21: Deros TheDestructor the Thugian
22: Darksword Xar the Human  
23: Fireface Por the Monitanian 
24: Ryonuske Ryoga the Monitanian 
25: NeyHawk Laserman the Thugian  
26: Ballin Gorgoff the Thugian  
27: IAMLoRDWeS WeSiZME the Oog-ra 
28: Darios Braknar the Thugian  
29: Tobold Ulhammer the Thugian  
30: Pwent Pinner the Thugian  

The Clerics of the Hand, too, have seen some interesting shifting of places.  Lorelei and Dnara still maintain the first and second positions respectively.  Shinto has moved up a notch from the number four spot to number three.  Kusan and Requiem has made no progress nor has been seen since the last issue, and have droppe from 3 and 5 to 5 and 11, respectively. Five newcomers have come to take their place among the top ten, Paratwa now holds a strong fourth, and Inkha, Rugal,  retta, and Exyx, now hold spots  6-9, respectively.

1: Lorelei Nilsfulcentrual the Leuian 
2: Dnara Hesseneth the Leuian  
3: Shinto Askani the Leuian 
4: Paratwa OsKaloq the Leuian 
5: Kusan Kudi the Leuian 
6: Inkha Pyreethan the Leuian  
7: Rugal Orochii the Leuian 
8: retta clawsworth the Leuian 
9: Exyx Worldview the Hithual 
10: Bent Ironhill the Leuian 
11: Requiem Mass the Leuian 
12: sitruc nitsua the Leuian  
13: Danica Deathdancer the Leuian 
14: Sarcath Brighteyes the Leuian 
15: Tetyanna Velvetpaw the Leuian 
16: Arclight Lastday the Leuian

Greetings fine writers of the DFC,

I have a minor change to the prize list. You will note, that at 10,000 words, you can select a mid-level fam from Enrique's Familiar Eporium. However, I have a problem with this. I have sent me assistant Elijah all across the Spur and beyond looking for these creatures and he has found none of them. I can only guess that when Enrique left the Spur all those 200 years ago, he also took his breeding stock, leaving none in the Spur. To correct this, I am adding familiar collars in place of the above familiar options.

               Yours truly,
                     Aloysious Xavior Sparkleman

Greetings Fellow Spurians, 
  I am Jonkirk Bayard, First Speaker of the Cleric's Guild.  I am honored to announce the formation of the Guild and hope all clerics of the land will choose to attend our Assemblies and be heard.  We meet every Sunday in the evening at the Guild Hall in the Guild District.  All clerics are encouraged to attend.
  The purpose of the Guild is to; share information among the clerical masses, help new clerics get started in the Spur, give the Spurian citizenry a responsive body for all religious matters, and provide a Council to rule on matters when necessary.
  The formation of the Guild was no easy matter.  The blackened walls and ceiling of the Hall attest to many different religions, races, and alignments each having their say in how the Guild should be organized.  A quick discussion of the Guild's organization is in order.  All Guild positions are elected and serve at the will of the other clerics.  I am honored to be First Speaker of the Guild.  I preside over Assemblies and represent the Guild at official functions.  The High Council represents Chaos, Entropy, and Order and meets when needed.  The Council is the main body and represents each temple at Assembly.  An important point to emphasize is that each cleric has a vote when they attend Assembly.  Council members will be published in the next issue of the DFC.  
  The healing of thieves was previously debated.  The Council quickly voted not to restrict healing on the basis of profession but did agree to discuss the issue on a by-name basis. 
  There are still some vacant seats on the Council that should be filled within the next few Assemblies, so show up and guide the direction of your Guild. Future plans include organized hunting groups and other events designed to help new clerics along the difficult but rewarding path they have chosen. More information will follow in future editions but be it known that the Cleric's Guild is alive and well in the Spur.  See you out there.              In Service to the Guild, Jonkirk Bayard.

*Notice from the Spur Council of Physicians*

There is an epidemic of mass delusion spreading at an increasing rate among the citizens of the Spur.  The origin of this disease was traced all the way back to the Training Grounds, and somehow made it's way in to the Spur. Please if you see anyone displaying any of the symptoms below they might be infected.  Please this disease can be highly contagious to those who are not aware of it!


                             Emag A Ni Gnivil
                      (technical name for the disease)
                             Living In A Game

1) Inhabitant keeps begging for help with the game
	Cause: Sudden and unprepared arrival upsets chemical brain composition.  Makes people think they are playing some sort of game.
	Cure: Swift bop over the head followed by screaming in their right ear 'this is not a game!'

2) Inhabitant wants to know how to improve something called Stats 
	(this one is still unsolved by the council)
	*update* we have determined that guilds refer to one's attributed, like one's 	strength, quickness, mental sharpness, ect ect as Stats.  This was first thought a symptom of the disease, but further testing has shown otherwise.

3) Inhabitant displays signs of severe hysteria when they can't see
	Cause: The new surroundings causes short term memory loss.
	Cure: Swift bop over the head followed by explaining that you can't
      see in the dark and you should Ready a Torch

4) Inhabitant ask the same questions over and over again.  Usually these questions are along the lines of day to day simple tasks.
	Cause: They failed to receive the Manual that would answer most their questions.
	Cure: Swift bop over the head and instruct them to the library where they can obtain their copy of the Manual (note the Manual is now free due to the massive influx of people)

5) Inhabitant become spell bound and believe that any dead creature lying on the ground belongs to them.
	Cause: A heavy feeling of egoism and heliocentrism.
	Cure: Instruct them that you should search monsters you kill.  *Warining, do not	attempt to remedy this with a Swift bop over the head.  These people are usually highly temperamental and possibly violent

6) Inhabitant believe that everyone who lives in town should be attacked and killed.
	Cause: Sheltered life, no exposure to nobles, merchants, townsmen, et et.
	Cure: Explain calmly that not all inhabitants of the Spur should be attacked (Rogues and rabid dogs excluded)  If problem persists, let the local guard handle it.
7) Inhabitant repeatedly asks for directions
	Cause: Lack of obtaining a map
	Cure: Swift bop over the head and instruct them to the same place where they got their manual.  A free map is available to them as well.

8) Inhabitants become paranoid and distressed when they can not invoke rune magic.
	Cause: No exposure to magic except for what traveling bards told them
	Cure: Swift bop over the head followed by personal instruction (by you) or refer them to the Manual ( see number 4, section heading Cure:)

9) Inhabitants start talking in strange tongues (origin unknown.)  Speech is very had to understand, but some words have been recorded; they are : 

Computer, Modem, 	14.4 (?), 28.8(?), AOL, Genie, Crash, Freeze, et et.

	Cause: Taking to many hits to the head during combat
	Cure: Stare at them (important to stare) and say 'Watch your ooc', or 

'No occ'. Although the meaning of ooc is unknown at this time, it seems to have some countering ability to this speech.

10) *This was reported to us by a dragon who wishes to remain anynomys*  Inhabitants on the link tend to use the word type to instruct people how to preform actions. 
	Cause: Persons still unable to get rid of the shock of thier new surroundings
	Cure: If one responds with the word Type? (question mark is very important) 	the person who said type will often snap out of thier daze and realize that they are rambling

Final note, more and more symptoms are being discovered, so read the local bulletin board for updates. The council has also concluded that eradicating this disease is futile, we can only hope to contain and diminish the number it infects.
