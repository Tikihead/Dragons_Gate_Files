Letter from the Editor

Greetings Citizens of Spur, I write to you from the Lair, deep in the south lands, as I am Outlaw of Spur. As you all are becoming aware, there have been recent developments with a Peddler, a Drag-al named Pensirlious Prenn. He has the audacity to sell me an item that has forever changed my being, and thus he paid the price for his mistake, as I have struck him down. I see my actions as justified and right, as for the Justices he cried out to, they see his plight as the legitimate plead for help. Prenn will find that his days will catch up to him, from all the bad items and people he has crossed in the past come full circle. I am working on having the Merchant's Guild expel this fraud for what he is, and thus, the shops shall return to normal business. Until then, I am sorry for the inconvenience I have caused, but I will not recant, and I will not feel sorry for actions justly deserved on his part. It was sad to see Divine Justice put a price on my head, and cause other fine Citizens of Spur to put their lives at risk to get my head. I see this as bringing on their deaths, thus Divine Justice is as much of a murderer as she lives by her own laws. I do not recognize those laws, and I will not stand trial to satisfy the cries of the guilty. I see the greed in the eyes of those that came to hunt me, and I have dealt with them, exacting a price for their troubles. I see this price paid in full now, but should any others come, I will defend myself. I am sorry for those that must see this, but it happens, as we cannot make everyone happy with everything we do. We do not live by Spur's laws, but most of our actions fall within them, it is times like these when we dispense our own form of justice that some may not agree with.

Sincerely,
Michael
Editor in Chief

A messenger enters the postal area. He opens his pouch, pulls out a scroll, and approaches the bulletin board. Peeling off the seal, unfurling the scroll and dropping the seal to the floor, the messenger attaches the scroll to the board, jots down some notes after reading your recent posts and exits. As you pick up the seal you notice that it dons a familiar insignia depicting a single arrow. You take a look at the post.

My friends, I write to you from the garden of our beautiful temple. My purpose is to tell you of the events leading to my recent coming of age. 

It began a few days ago, as I tracked a young Arachnian who'd evaded me, towards the temple of Taath. I flew to the earth to examine the tracks in a puddle of mud. As I knelt to get a better look, there was a bright flash almost immediately in front of me. When I looked up I saw standing before me a huge eagle-like angel who's size and splendor blocked all from my sight but her. It was ELINDALE. Now, those who know me well know that I've never been a very religious man. This was the first time I'd ever had any relation with my God!

"DarkRanger," she thundered, "How is it that the only time you've kneeled before me is when you are tracking a weakling and I had to sneak upon you like a thief in the night?" I fell flat upon my face before my maker. After a brief, startled pause she boomed deep, rumbling laughter from her most guttural of regions. "Save that for the alter, my son... I wish to show you something about being a true forester. On your feet, now." Her voice had the gentleness and caring of a loving mother, but at the same time the deep, overwhelming strength of the eldest fourth staged dragon.

As I began to heave my not-so-in-shape body to my feet I felt an intervening force gently helping me to my feet. I gaped in awe at this wonderful being, not even noticing that I was hovering slowly towards her. As I joined Elindale in spirit, my body in the physical world fell temporarily lifeless to the earth, to be later stripped of all my dirty, mistempered belongings by thieves.

Meanwhile, I was taken on the journey of a lifetime. As each of Elindale's followers called to her for help I zipped and zapped with her all over Spur. I saw many things that day. One such scene was that of a kind forester, praying to Elindale to heal a badly weakened Arachnian! This shocked me as I've never seen an Arachnian help anyone but this kind being was humble enough to help one when they were down. We shot to another place. Here, I saw Guztymne being beaten to a pulp by some rogues! Elindale seemed to eye him as an old friend and chuckled, knowing he would find his own way out, somehow (she told me to tell you that's why you spent so long and got no answer). We zipped somewhere else. Here, I saw one of my long-time mentors, Rahvin. He seemed to be at perfect peace, meditating in Elindale's Grotto, surrounded by nature. He opened his eyes, briefly, sensing a foreign presence. I wondered why we came here, Rahvin obviously being in no need of assistance, but later I think I understood. After doing this for a while we finally came back to the place where our voyage had began. 

I stood up feeling somewhat more spry (and still not knowing why) than when I had left. I looked around for my new prime interest but she only remained as an echo in my mind saying, "Remember what you saw... do not forget my teachings and always follow the true Elindalean ways..." The voice faded away leaving me standing in not only a cold mud puddle but an eerie silence.

Since then, I've found a quiet, out of the way place to hunt in the Tanga jungles and I've devoted all my time and earnings to Elindale, which is why you won't be seeing me much anymore. I have reformed my deviant ways and now follow the path of a full fledged forester. I have forgotten any quarrels I've had with anyone. I will try to make it to the Gladiators' Games as often as I can and hopefully, one day, I will reach my full spiritual potential and be able to join you all again as an active part in the Spurian community (OOC: that is, hopefully these cursed charges aren't permanent.). Until that day, I will continue to send word of my experiences and receive word from you, via my messenger and this message board.

============================================================================
The following is the tale of the youth of Melraath, and how he came to Spur, where he would someday be one of the most skilled thieves in Spur, and one of the most famous, hated, pompous Khats ever.

Born Melraath Enstice Rheop, Melraath was the youngest of 9 boys and 3 girls.  He was always the runt of the family, far weaker and smaller than the rest of his family.  He proved to be utterly useless to his poor father.  His mother had died in birthing him, something his father Jarkrek'l never forgave him of.  Karkrek'l was a thief, and poor at it.  He sold his youngest, weakest son to a "rich", childless merchanting family when the boy was a mere 8 years old.  The family name was SilentPaw, they provided a good life for him in Meetpoint, his adoptive father Keshmef's affluence pulling him from legal binds often.  Melraath grew fond of the SilentPaw's "servant". more of a slave, Un'teel... a Muatana-al.  He was kept locked in the old wine cellar, allowed only the vermin and rodentry that came to the basement to stave off the bloodlust of his race.  Un'teel was a wise thief, and taught Melraath much that he knew.  Melraath, at age 12, was quite a good thief already.  He and Un'teel practiced most of the time, as Un'teel could do naught in the daylight.

When Melraath was 15, there was an odd plague.  No rodents or vermin of any kind were seen in Meetpoint that summer.  Un'teel began to fade away, slowly dying, and Keshmef forced Melraath away from his old friend.  Melraath would sneak to the cellar at night, with an ability at stealthing that none in Meetpoint had ever seen, and allow Un'teel to drain small bits of his health away, reveling in the closeness of the touch that stole his life, and gave to another.  Melraath was quite a compassionate young man, until Keshmef found out about his nightly trips to "feed" Un'teel.

Keshmef's actions on this matter wholly changed Melraath.  Keshmef, with his "piety" and "devotion" (through Gold) to Set, hired a Priest for 2 days.  He staked Melraath's dear friend Un'teel in the back of the house, at dawn on Melraath's 16th birthday.  The priest was to use his healing powers to keep Un'teel alive.  The moment the Sunlight touched his skin, Un'teel began to scream in ultimate agony.  His flesh was being dissolved before his eyes.  Melraath watched wide-eyed, looking blankly from Keshmef to the Priest who was healing Un'teel and back to Un'teel himself.  Un'teel suffered 16 hours in the sunlight, being healed by the Priest, and dying slowly from the pain.  Keshmef truly believed he was showing his "son" he cared for him, by killing the thing that brought Melraath pain.  But Keshmef was a blind man,  not realizing Melraath gave his life to save his friend openly!  The Evening of Melraath's 16th birthday, he slid into Keshmef's room, and silently opened  Keshmef's personal safe, finding a rather large bag of gold, a small fortune, enough to pay a prince's ransom.  He took this, and a small, ebony stiletto from Keshmef, his clothes and headed to the back of the property, to Un'teel.

"Un'teel, friend, come with me," Melraath hissed close to Un'teel's face, slicing the ropes with the stiletto. "come with me to freedom!"

Un'teel moaned almost silently, then pulled Melraath close to him.  "Mel... yer a good thief.. I'm almost dead, get yer arse out of here.. I'm gonna be dead before the night's over, just..." and then fell silent, dropping limply to the ground.

Melraath's eyes blazed with a dark fury, something he had never felt before.  His heart turned to ice and he ran back into the house, and into Keshmef's room.  He took a deep, hard breath, about to change his life forever.  His paw tightened around the hilt of the stiletto.  He stood over Keshmef, his father for all these years, who treated him so well.  Swallowing hard, he taped Keshmef on the shoulder, then shook him a bit, bringing him to wakedness.  "Keshmef," he whispered. "For Un'teel."  Melraath leaned over Keshmef, driving the stiletto into Jarsala, Keshmef's wife, piercing her heart, killing her before even a moan could leave her.  Keshmef pushed Melraath upwards, screaming in Fury.  "how, you little son of unwedlock mother, could you do this!!" he screamed.  Melraath pointed out the window, facing the back yard.

"How," Melraath said, sliding the stiletto silently to Keshmef's throat, "Could you do that?"  Melraath let out a long slow growl, and pushed the stiletto blade upwards, into Keshmef's throat.

*************************************************************************************

When Melraath was 18, he ruled Meetpoint.  He was better than any thief that had lived there, and had more gold than the governor himself.  He and Pov Nerp the flerian, his lackey and dearest friend, lived in a small house near the city's small business district.  Melraath was GuildMaster of the Thieve's Guild of Meetpoint.  Feeling that the fun of Meetpoint was gone, he convinced Pov to take him to Flerome.  They bought a few supplies, and Melraath, in a new set of light steelwood mail, brandishing an old stiletto, and  Pov wearing little more than a pair of buck hide moccasins and carrying no weaponry, left Meetpoint for Flerome.

Aside from being jumped by 3 highwaymen, whom Melraath sweet talked out of their weapons for far less than any good merchant would sell them for, the trip was uneventful.  Most of Melraath's stay in Flerome was uneventful, to be true.  Aside from learning how good thugara roots could be when smoked from pipes, and learning what it was like to be in the sheets with a flerian, Melraath's stay was quite uneventful.  His ability to pick pockets was far superior to even the kleptomaniac race.  At 25, Melraath left his old friend Pov and many lovers behind, but swore to his blood brother Pov to meet him again.

Melraath traveled northward, and stopped along the way at a large inn, south of Spur.  He spent the night in a small cottage, opting to save his gold.  That night, sleeping heavily, Melraath woke to an odd sound.  He heard a loud squeak, took it for a rat, which he was used to in Flerome, and fell back asleep.

Melraath woke the next morning, and slid into his armor, which was getting quite battered and worn.  He reached for his coinpurses, but found them missing.  Thinking he had had too much ale, he searched the room for them, to no avail.  In a fit of rage, Melraath punched a rather large hole in a wall, revealing the a pair of Sanene making love in the room next to his.  He ran from the inn, Stiletto-less and penniless.  He slid out of the shadows for a moment to grab a few silvers from a rather pathetic looking man, and realized he was wearing tailored silks, and carried a beautiful scimitar.  Melraath grabbed the scimitar from the noble's scabbard, and grabbed two small coinpurses before charging northward, to the city of Spur, not seeing the three Guardsmen rushing after him.  Passing through a large Gateway, Melraath stopped to read a sign, and then heard the pounding of Steel-booted feet charging in his direction. He slid into the shadows and the Guards stopped just further along the road.  One grunted something about "Town Square" and they charged northward again.

"Hmm Town Square. Bet i can find some sucker with a big purse near that place," Melraath thought to himself, as he slid from shadow to shadow northward.  A few moments later he saw a tall muscular black Leuian, tearing three Guards, the same three who had been seeking him, apart.  Melraath slid from the shadows and reached for this Khat's purse.  The Khat turned after downing the last guard, then looked down at Melraath and said, "Um.. You got a reason ta be in my pocket?"

Melraath turned and ran west, The Khat following him.  Melraath was completely lost, and was downed by this strong khat in seconds.  The Khat dragged him in a south westerly direction, talking.  "I'm Orchist," he said.  "I'm a powerful thief here in Spur.," the Khat said through a smirk.  "Looks like I'm goin' to have to teach a ya a few things." 

Melraath knew he had met his match.  "Look," he said in a deep, ethereal Spirit-voice, "I'm sorry, man.. had no clue you were another..."

Orchist cut him off.  "No need to explain, don't expect anyone new to Spur to know me."  He shrugged, then said, "Hey, depart from the land, ask Set to bring you home... I'll see ya in a sec."

Melraath departed, leaving his spirit form behind, and came back, naked, lying on the Alter of Set.

"Put some clothes on," Orchist chided.

Melraath stood and slid into his armor.  "Follow me," Orchist said.  "I'm going to teach you a few things..."

So ends the tale of Melraath's childhood and young life, and his coming to Spur.  Later may follow a longer tale, or series of Tales of Melraath's Adventures in Spur, living the life of one of the most hated, hateful inhabitants of Spur.

Calondin Fflammdwyn:  A Brief History of the Frontacian / Psycian War

Submitter's Note

Some two hundred years ago, one of my less ignoble ancestors traveled to the Spur and then into the world beyond it.  In his later years, he spent much time writing scrolls so that his knowledge may outlive him.  I submit here one collection of his works, detailing the history of our ancient conflict with the Frontacians.  This history is based upon his research into what has otherwise been glossed over in the histories we are taught.  It is provided for your edification.

I have included the preface he wrote for what are known as the Scrolls of Calondin Fflammdwyn so that his writings may have some context.  I believe his intent was to bring greater understanding to the world through knowledge.  In keeping with that intent, I humbly submit his knowledge to you.
Preface

Some time ago, I spent a short duration learning my trade in a violent little city called the Spur.  Some of the events that I encountered there led me to question our history as it has been taught to us.  Given my newly honed skills, I left the Spur for a voyage of discovery into the world.  During this trip, I learned many things not only about our race, the Psycians, but also about our history and the history of our world.  I have recorded this knowledge in these scrolls in the hope that others may benefit from my research.

In service to Odarous,

The Time Before War

Any history of the Frontacian / Psycian conflict would be incomplete without a background of the world at the time.  I hope this scroll will provide such a background.

This is the tale of a time long past, when the petty conflicts of individuals mattered little in a world at large.  This is a tale of a world where magick had not been mastered and each race had its place.  Specifically, this is a tale of a mighty empire and one of its client states.  This is the tale of the Frontacian Empire and the Isle of Psycia.

The Frontacian Empire

As we all know, there was a time when the known world was ruled by the Frontacian Empire.  While there is no doubt that this is true, the name suggests an imperial dictatorship when, in truth, it was hardly that at all.

Unlike their descendants, the Frontacians of old were not aloof and uncaring as they are now.  Well, actually, they were, but less so.  To a Frontacian, the most important things in life were the self, the family, the Empire, and anyone else, in that order.  This order of precedence led to the development of a mighty but flawed empire, as individual and family struggles to gain dominance always stood in the way of racial unity.

One may wonder how the Frontacians were able to build such a mighty and encompassing empire.  While it is hard to reconstruct the details of a time so long past, the Frontacian power base was built on the control of trade.

The Frontacians were the mightiest traders of the known world, managing and controlling the distribution of goods amongst the many islands of the world.  Perhaps it was because so much of the world was separated by stretches of water that a trading empire could develop.  Whatever the root, the Frontacians had two major advantages above all other races when it came to trade, they had their magickal bridges that allowed goods to be moved quicker than any sailing vessel, and they had their Psycians to communicate needs across vast distances.  By being able to instantly know the needs of one community and then rapidly fill those needs, the Frontacians were able to always beat outside competition, thus allowing them to charge premium rates and dominate not only the world trade in goods, but the world trade in currency for those goods.  Such an advantage was sufficient to bring all races, at least in name, under the auspices of the Frontacian Empire.  Perhaps the other races understood that whoever controlled the flow of goods had a good bit of control over their lives.  Perhaps they had no choice, understanding or not.  The net result was, however, that all races paid duty, literally and figuratively, to the Frontacians.

I have mentioned that to a Frontacian, family comes before Empire.  This degree of importance was no more visible than in the fact that the Empire was not one great trading beast.  Rather, within the empire, individual families vied for dominance within both court and the trade centers of the world.  It is a fact that the name Empire was somewhat of a misnomer, for the Empire did not have an emperor.  Rather, it had a council of traders who managed the subject lands and allocated monopolies to individual families or clans.  The Council understood the damage that could be done to their power if they allowed competition among the families to create price wars.  Therefore, they partitioned the world into areas, each controlled by a different family.  When trade involved more than one family, one where the goods were needed, others where the goods were available, the families would work together or against each other to cement the deal.  However, only one family would be involved in the final sale to the customers.  This system allowed the Frontacians to maintain their monopoly while continuing to vie internally.  Often an upstart family would undercut the competition to be the source of goods for a transaction.  Of course, any savings on the source goods were never passed along to the customers.

I mentioned the two factors that allowed Frontacians to dominate trade.  Each deserves more attention, as it was they that led up to the War and eventually they that caused the fall of the Empire.

The first were the magickal bridges mentioned in the common histories.  These amazing feats of magick allowed the Frontacians to instantly move not only individuals but entire caravans from one place to another.  The value of such a bridge was twofold.  First, it allowed rapid delivery of goods in times of need.  Second, it allowed rapid deployment of warriors.  My research suggests that the standard procedure in Frontacian expansion was to build a bridge anchor, for a bridge required a start and endpoint to function, and then use it to deploy warriors to subjugate a newly discovered land, if necessary.  This was not always necessary, however, for some cultures were willing to give themselves over to the Empire willingly in exchange for a bridge anchor being built.  In either case, once an anchor was built, the Frontacians had effective control, both militarily and financially, over the surrounding environs.

The other major factor in the Frontacian trade dominance was their employment of Psycians for long distance communication.  There are those of you, who reading this now will wonder about the need for this as any accomplished mage can achieve the same effect.  Simply put, the amber aura did not exist yet, nor did the white aura.

Psycians were employed by Frontacian trading families to act as conduits for information.  If one part of the world had a sudden need for goods, perhaps a brutally cold winter or a drought induced famine, the Psycian communications network was able to pass the information along rapidly.  This allowed the Frontacians to take advantage of the need and capitalize on it.  In exchange for their services, the Psycians charged a commission on the ensuing transactions.  Although the amounts involved were not insignificant, common history suggests that the Psycians were not interested in dominance, so the moneys were not a threat to the Frontacian Empire.

The Isle of Psycia

The Psycians of this era were much as we are today, dedicated to the pursuit of knowledge and the expansion of ourselves.  Having always been limited by our physical stature, we were ever more interested in finding intellectual solutions rather than physical ones.  Being dedicated to the Mind, the Psycians often seemed to forget the physical world around them.  This appearance, however, was far from the truth.
It has been said that Psycians appear distant and are often best described as simply professional.  While both these descriptions are on the surface accurate, they belie the heart of the Psycian.  However, I seem to be digressing from my account.  My apologies.

The Isle of Psycia was the home to all of the Psycian race.  Special properties of the soil there allowed the growth of the herbs that made it possible for Psycians to venture out into the world without going insane from the constant babble of untrained minds.  Although, as with all races, there were those of Psycia possessed of the wanderlust, most were content to live their lives peacefully pursuing their studies and enjoying the joy of Unity with one-another.

The government of Psycia would best be described as a democracy.  Given the ease with which a Psycian can express opinions, it was impossible for any sort of authoritarian government to take hold.  Although nominally a part of the Frontacian Empire, Psycia seldom had need of outside trade and, due to the Frontacian need for the goodwill of the Psycians, was mostly left to itself.

During the age of the Frontacian expansion, Psycia was happy to support the Frontacian Empire, as expansion brought with it knowledge.  As I have said, knowledge was akin to food for Psycians.  It could be said that the relationship between the Psycians and the Frontacians was parasitic, with the Psycians living off the work of the Frontacians.  Given what the Psycians gave in back to the Frontacians, a symbiotic relationship would be more accurate.

The Stirrings of War
The End of an Age

The metaphorical symbiosis between the Frontacians and their Psycian employees continued without trouble for a long time.  However, eventually this peaceful relationship started to stumble.
The Age of Exploration dominated by the Frontacians eventually came to a close, as the known world was discovered, explored, and dominated.  The Frontacian Empire had a presence everywhere there was.
Soon after the exploration ceased, the energies that had been dedicated to growth and conquering turned elsewhere.  The Frontacians had become used to the ever increasing gains of an expanding empire.  However, once the expansion stopped, they found themselves having to find other ways to increase their wealth.  In their analysis of the disposition of moneys in the Frontacian Empire, the commission paid to the Psycians suddenly loomed large.  It began to gall the Frontacians that they were giving moneys to a lesser race.  They soon started trying to find ways to exact service from the Psycians, rather than purchase it.
Now it might be suggested that as a Psycian, I am biased against the Frontacians.  While it is true that I bear them some extensive ill will for what they did to my ancestral home, as a historian it would be improper of me not to tell the whole truth.  Although it is true that the Frontacians started demanding more service and got less forthcoming with their fees, the Psycians also played a part in what eventually turned to war.

As I have said, the Psycians were happy to assist the Frontacians in their expansion mostly to garner extra knowledge for themselves.  When the Age of Expansion ended, the Psycians of the time no longer had this extra incentive.  Furthermore, they soon realized that the Frontacians would turn elsewhere for gains, once the expansion stopped.  Having been supporters of, if not allies to, the Frontacians for so long, it could be said that the Psycians had helped the Frontacian Empire to become what it was.  That they started having second thoughts once the Frontacians were no longer of use to them is little excuse for the damage they helped cause to other would be traders and the other races of the lands.

The turning of attentions from expansion into other areas took many forms among the Frontacians.  I have already mentioned the anger the Frontacians started to feel towards the Psycians.  However, what was likely the most damaging to the Empire was the increased internal rivalry.  Where before individual families had co-existed, trading internally and monopolizing their own districts, now they started actively feuding with each other, in order to expand their monopolies.  Since their world was not expanding, the only way for one family's wealth to grow was at the cost of another family's.

Now this was by no means a quick turn of events.  In any large institution, change takes time.  Thus it was with the Frontacian Empire.  The Age of Exploration gave way to the Age of Dominance over the course of many years.

At first, the changes were subtle.  Perhaps the chief factor of one family would suddenly fall ill and die.  Perhaps the foods needed to save a Pentathian city from famine would be withheld.  One family would grow weaker, while another grew stronger.  Thus did the rivalries grow.  Although it never escalated to obvious warring between factions, the occasional assassination was not unheard of.  During all this time, the tension between the Frontacians and the Psycians continued to grow.  Due to their nature, it did not take long for the Psycians to realize that a sudden death of one of their own in the employ of the Frontacians was anything but accidental.  Realizing that they were merely pawns in the internecine feuds among the Frontacians, the Psycians sought to take steps to defend themselves.

Because of the long-standing relationship between the Psycians and the Frontacians, the Psycians did not have the option of merely withdrawing their services.  Having never been a militaristic race, they were not prepared to offer such a significant insult to the Frontacians.  Therefore, unable to simply withdraw from the situation, the Psycians decided to work against the Frontacians in subtle ways.

The Hidden War

There was a long period of well hidden hostilities between the Frontacians and the Psycians.  This period was filled with small scale violence and various depths of subterfuge.  There were too many episodes for me to detail each one here.  Perhaps Bards rather than historians should do the telling of individual tales.  That being the case, I will limit myself to recording the key events during this cold war that led up to the catastrophic conclusion that ended not only the Isle of Psycia, but also much of the Frontacian Empire itself.

Shortly after the Age of Expansion ended, the internal structure of the Frontacian Empire was forced, by the lack of new frontiers, to change.  While the basic format of a Traders' Council did not change, the next level in the hierarchy did change dramatically.

For centuries, the Frontacian Council was made up of an elite group of families.  Membership on the Council was given only to those invited in by the Council itself.  Given that those on the Council were not keen to share the power, the rare family that managed to get added to the Council did so by applying sufficient pressure to the necessary majority of the Council to receive the invitation.  At the end of the Age of Exploration, there were twelve seats on the Council filled.

Now, these representatives of twelve families hardly were enough to represent the interests of the myriad of Frontacian trading families.  However, due to the near pathological rivalries that existed between families, the Council never united sufficiently to grant the elite families all the power and exclude those not represented.  The reality was quite the opposite, as those on the Council constantly sought to undermine the positions of the others on the Council, often in retribution for some age-old slight.  Surprisingly, the constant jockeying for position and strength within the Council allowed the smaller families to flourish, at least to some extent, in the expanding empire.  Of course, when the Empire stopped expanding, this turbulent balance was bound to change.

Change it did.  The influx on new lands, and with them new markets, had brought the Frontacians an ever-growing economy.  When this source of growth evaporated, the Frontacians, as I have mentioned, turned to other means to increase their wealth.  The most dramatic method, at least internal to the Frontacian Empire, was that the Council agreed to agree long enough to parcel out the known world amongst the families represented on the Council.  The lesser families would be under the authority of the greater family to which they were assigned.  While this new hierarchy did bring greater wealth to the elite, it did so at the cost of the lesser families who were none too pleased.  They, in turn, grew more competitive with the other families in their caste, vying more and more for a bigger slice of the proverbial pie.

Aware of the discontent caused by their machinations, the Council saw fit to start creating opportunities for wealth.  These opportunities could take many forms, be it a poor harvest in one area or the eruption of a battle between neighbors.  Whatever the form, there was always room for an enterprising trader to make a profit.  While it is true that the Council, aware of the upcoming need from the manufactured opportunity, could profit the most itself, they allowed lesser families to play a role, thus giving them a share in the profits.  Now I am not suggesting that every border dispute or famine or assassination that took place during the Age of Domination was the result of Frontacian meddling.  However, you will find a Frontacian factor or emissary close at hand to many of that period's violent episodes.

Needless to say, those who were aware of the Frontacian manipulations of the other races were a bit disconcerted.  Primary among these were the Psycians, who belatedly discovered some guilt for the role in keeping the Frontacians in power.  This realized guilt, along with the lessened benefits from working with the Frontacians led the elder Psycians to start machinations of their own.

Initially, the Psycian efforts where primarily focused on the dissemination of information to the other races.  On more than one occasion, a Frontacian plot would be foiled by a word or two put in by a Psycian.  The Psycians, however, did not limit themselves to simply working against the Frontacians among the other races of the world.  The Psycians' underground rebellion against the Frontacians in power was also taken into the Frontacian homeland itself.

The Psycians who made up the communications network for the Frontacians had always had as their mandate that they would forward information only to the specific persons requested by their Frontacian masters.  This control of information allowed the Frontacians to direct who would profit from a famine, for although many families may have interests in food resources, only those contacted would know to put their interests for sale in particular areas.  This control was not, of course, limited to foodstuffs, but was valid for any commodity for which where was a sudden need, be it weapons, wool, or whatever.

One of the goals of the Frontacian Council had always been to maximize profits by limiting free enterprise.  However, their change in structure at the end of the Age of Exploration created sufficient unrest among the lesser families that the occasional leakage of information from one Psycian to another brought on a surge of price competition among the families.  It could be said that no greater blow was made against the Frontacians way of life than that of the Psycians releasing to general circulation their inside information.  Suddenly, many families were vying to be the source of goods in trade deals.  The birth of a free enterprise economy in the Frontacian Empire terrified those on the Council, for wealth and control were their foundations.  However, because the entire Frontacian trade mechanism relied on the Psycian ability to communicate over vast distances instantly, little could be done in direct retaliation.  Given that the Frontacians could not simply kill all the Psycians, the anger at being played that was not given vent started to fester within their souls.

The efforts of the Psycians were not the only source for anger to the Frontacian Council.  Not only were there reports of Frontacian families undercutting each other, a previously unheard of thing, but also of mysterious traders of other races seeming to appear out of nowhere, selling needed goods and vanishing.  Somehow, it seemed to the Frontacians, there were traders who were reacting faster than the Frontacians themselves to emergency needs.  Perhaps because of their aloof superiority, the Frontacians simply could not fathom how anyone without the aid of the Frontacian magickal bridges could bring goods to remote locations so fast.  This inability to believe that they were being beaten at their own game of instant trade, the Frontacians grew steadily more frustrated and started turning to their military for enforcement of their monopoly.

The Psycian Subterfuge

Any history of the conflict between the Frontacians and the Psycians would be incomplete without a discussion of the role the Psycians played in the development of war.  The tight grip in which the Frontacians held the rest of the world's races makes it easy to blame the Frontacians for all the harm that was done.  However, it would be unfair to the truth not to acknowledge that the Psycians played a significant role in increasing the anger and frustration that eventually led the Frontacians to violence.  An altruist may say that it was the very arrogance of the Frontacians that was the root of their violence.  While that is a valid point, it forgets that such arrogance is the very nature of Frontacians.  To dismiss this would be akin to blaming the Secians for giving aid to those being hunted down for the crimes.  The justice of the world may demand the death of those who kill for pleasure, and it may be true that a Secian healing one such and thus allowing him to kill again is in part guilty of abetting the further crimes.  However, we cannot blame the ensuing deaths caused by the criminals on the Secian who healed him simply because it is the nature of the Secian to heal.  Likewise, while me may abhor the atrocities committed by the Frontacians, that they were driven by their very nature explains their behavior, even if it does not forgive it.
I say all this because, as a Psycian myself, I expect the revelations of the next few passages will focus on me some of the unbridled hatred my own kind has for the Frontacians.  Those who suffer the most like to believe they were innocents abused by some great evil.  I do not deny that the loss of our home and most of our race was a horrific disaster.  That perhaps we brought it on ourselves, at least to some extent, is not a popular suggestion.  However, popular or not, it is true.

The Psycian effort to weaken the Frontacian Empire hardly stopped at promoting free enterprise through the dissemination of information.  There were, among a rare group of the Psycians, those with extremely rare capabilities.  These Masters of the Mind were enlisted to promote trade among the other races in a way that rivaled the trade of the Frontacians.  Specifically, these Psycians were able to transport people and occasional items much like they could transfer information, instantaneously and over great distances.  This allowed trade in small items faster than even the Frontacians could manage.  Additionally, since it was Psycians themselves who controlled the flow of information, the knowledge of needs could be forwarded to the Psycians' own traders before the Frontacians.

The subject races of the Frontacian Empire were initially startled to discover that others could provide their solutions to their trade needs.  After generations of relying on the Frontacians, it was unheard of to have outside sources.  This revelation struck at the very foundations of the control the Frontacian Empire had over the other races.  If the Frontacians could be beaten in their area of mastery, trade, in what other areas could they be beaten?  With this question, the other races of the world began to push at the boundaries of what their Frontacian masters would allow.

Finally the Psycians put their abilities to one other, ill considered, use.  Using their new influence with the lesser families they had aided in competition, the Psycians started feeding the more militant and discontented Frontacian families with what cannot be described as anything less that suggestions for assassinations.  By listening in on the planning of the Trade Council and then locating their messengers, the Psycians were able to foil many of the plots the Council hatched.  Often this was accomplished by beating the Frontacians out directly.  However, in some circumstances, the Frontacian plan was thwarted by successfully suggesting to a lesser family that they could profit by killing this envoy or detaining that one.  It would not be overly harsh to suggest that the Psycians were trying to encourage a civil war among the Frontacians as a means of toppling their power.  Considering themselves immune to retribution due to the Frontacian reliance of Psycian telepathy, the Psycians of the time were brash and often foolish.  The very arrogance that they used as reason to work against the Frontacians was becoming present in themselves.  Had the Psycians of that era not thought themselves safe from the Frontacian wrath, it is possible that the final outcome of the coming war would have been much different.

The Chain That Binds
The Age of Dominance

The Psycian arrogance that the Frontacians could not afford to harm them held true, for a time.  It was not long before the Frontacians discovered their underhanded tactics.  However, as I have mentioned, the Frontacians could do little.  At first, the Frontacians tried taking as prisoners the families of the Psycians in their employ.  They were startled to find that the Psycians did not seem to care about imprisonment.  Apparently they did not understand that to a race that follows the way of the Mind, the location of the physical body matters little.  Accounts of these prisoners suggest that they merely took their incarceration as an opportunity to reflect further on the Mind.  Some even thanked the Frontacians for taking them away from the daily chores that would otherwise have distracted them from their mental pursuits.  On the rare occasions that the Frontacians sought to punish an employee by the murder of his family, the prisoners would be found missing.  Although a few of the prisoners were indeed killed, the majority simply vanished from their cells.  This inability to dominate their Psycian underlings festered in the Frontacians and led to even greater anger.  This anger, however, remained unsatisfied, leading to greater frustrations.
Since the Frontacians felt they could not survive without their Psycian communications, they turned their increasing frustrations out into the world.  Where before they had been satisfied to dominate trade, they now sought to purely dominate.  While they still dominated trade, their control was not complete.  Apparently their desire for dominance was sufficiently threatened to warrant the application of physical domination.

The armies of the Frontacian Empire, bolstered by mercenary companies of various races, spread through their magickal bridges across the world.  Since at this point the known world was already effectively part of the Frontacian Empire, the presence of these armies served little purpose.  The Frontacians, however, apparently felt a need to reaffirm their position of power.  These regional armies were set to excising taxes and ensuring that any and all learned to fear the sight of a Frontacian.  The few who rebelled and challenged the Frontacians in battle quickly found themselves facing three times their number as reinforcements appeared through the magickal bridges.  In the Age of Dominance, none stood against the Frontacians and survived.  None except the Psycians they could not afford to estrange.

In every corner of the world, the Frontacian Empire made its presence felt.  Local guilds paid homage to their Frontacian masters.  Even the thieves of the world paid their dues to the Frontacians who suffered their existence.  The Age of Dominance was an unhappy time for the world.  It did not last long, as ages go, but the sheer brutality of it warrants the title in the annals of history.   Where there were those who spoke against the Frontacians, there were savage beatings and death.  Where there were those who told tales of Psycians aiding merchants, those who spoke were shunned by the fearful residents or simply disappeared.  In a world where Psycians exist, it is not possible to police the thoughts of the world.  However, the Frontacians certainly did try.

The Frontacians held the world, bound by the chain of their might and their magick.  Yet even as they did so, the presence of the Psycians, that all the world knew were working against the Frontacians, nicked away at the links of that chain.

A Tale of Two Magi

In the account of the Frontacian Empire and the Fall of Psycia, no two individuals played a greater role than the Frontacian mage Urios Zaarman and the Pentathian mage Hirs T'Varia.  While a great many others played significant parts in the events that shaped this time in the world, had not these two been born, lived, and done the things they had done at this specific time, one cannot imagine what the world would be now.

The story of Hirs T'Varia is a simple one.  Born during the Age of Dominance, he spent his childhood under the rule of the mighty Frontacian Empire.  His father was a Pentathian of little consequence, following one of the more mundane trades.  Hirs, however, had the spark of magery within him, and it was not long before he was enrolled in the area's university of magick.  So it was that one winter evening, returning home for a surprise visit, he found his mother, a local trader, in quiet discussion with a stranger.  Curious, he stayed hidden and watched.  From his account of the evening, as taken from his journal, the stranger gave his mother a collection of small parcels and then, stepping back from the heavily laden woman, the stranger glowed a frightful glow.  The next thing he knew, his mother had vanished.  A moment later, the Psycian, for this stranger could be nothing else, glowed again as he, too, vanished.
Hirs was, as most magi are, an intensely thoughtful individual.  Thus he pondered that strange event.  He had heard the stories of the fantastic traders appearing out of nowhere and bringing life saving goods in times of distress.  Although the Frontacians had done their best to quell such tales, those in the rural areas further from Frontacian dominance tended to believe.  If nothing else, it suggested one's oppressors were fallible.  So it was that Hirs waited where he stood, hoping for his mother's return.  Some few hours later, she did return, with her Psycian companion, laden not with parcels but with gold.

Hirs took this experience back with him to his university, where, in the deepest recesses of the university library, he set to work trying to accomplish this feat of translocation.  Perhaps it is the folly of the magi to believe that anything can be done, given enough research.  Whether this is true or not is best left for philosophical discussion.  In this case, Hirs was, after many years of research, able to accomplish the creation of a new magickal weave.  In the annals of history, Hirs never became a memorable mage.  His gift was not in the invocation of runes, but in their development.  He took his new translocation aura to the Mages' Guild, where the resident Master promptly stole it and killed Hirs.  Only Hirs' journal remained to prove the discovery his.  Nonetheless, the Master of the Guild then spread the knowledge of this rune.  That now any mage of sufficient skill could effectively teleport himself or another of his choosing allowed magi to hire themselves out to traders seeking to compete directly with the Frontacians.  Thus another link in the chain with which the Frontacians held the world was broken.

Unlike the tale of Hirs T'Varia, the tale of Urios Zaarman is far from simple.  The family Zaarman was one of the greater of the lesser houses.  At some time in its past, it had made a bit to become part of the Council.  That bid had failed, the Zaarman family not being able to put sufficient pressure on the Council members to elect their inclusion.  With that loss came a great loss of favor as the cost of putting pressure backfired with the cost of not gaining power.  Even so, the family Zaarman was far from destroyed.  Rather, though they lived in disgrace, they still had sufficient resources to be a greater house, though not one of the elite.

Urios was the first child of the family liege.  That made her next in line to control the family.  Tales from the period talk of the great abuse she suffered in her youth from her peers.  Bearing the name Zaarman proudly, she was disdained by her contemporaries.  This, along with that special core that exists in those destined to change the world, created a hard, chiseled woman.  She vowed to bring the Zaarman name not only out of disgrace but to the very top of the Council.

The fire that burned within Urios' heart made her one of the greatest magi in Frontacian history.  Her father being in good health allowed her to travel the world, delving into the great storehouses of knowledge.  It is said that she took as her personal bodyguard one of the greatest Arachnian minds of her time and together they roamed the lands seeking to create new magicks.  While this last may be difficult to believe, given the nature of the Arachnians, it is said that with her aid, her Arachnian compatriot was able, on occasion, to practice the arts of magick himself.  Perhaps had her life not ended where it had, she may have been the one to undo the great UnMagick.  Of that, the world shall never know.

After many years of travel, Urios was recalled to the Frontacian homeland to assume her rightful position.  Her father had taken ill and was not expected to survive.  Although there is no suggestion of outside influence in his illness, Urios' twisted heart assumed that the Psycians were at fault.  At her father's deathbed, she vowed to remove the Psycian blot from the Frontacian Empire.

It is impossible for a historian to look back on time and know for certain what chain of events created a given circumstance.  However, all evidence suggests that Urios' difficult childhood combined with her legendary power led her to madness.  That she was raised in a household fallen in an Empire dissolute combined to put the focus for her madness on the Psycians.  Whatever the cause, she was the catalyst for the events to come.

When Urios took the seat of control in the family Zaarman, she dedicated all its resources to finding a way to be rid of the Psycians.  As a trading house, the Zaarmans had Psycians in their employ.  She found that unacceptable and devoted her energies to ending that situation.  With her Arachnian aide, she studied the ways of her Psycian underlings.  Perhaps it was her advanced skill in magery that allowed this to happen, perhaps it was her dedication.  Perhaps, it was her madness.  Whatever the cause, she was able, without outside teaching, to awaken her own latent psionics.

As a Psycian, the birth of a latent into the Mind is a joyous event.  Latents are such rarities that they should be cherished and nurtured.  They, alone, have the greatest potential to bring understanding of the Mind to the other races.  Unfortunately, Urios did not share the Psycian mindset regarding latent psionics.  Her discovery of her hidden potential drove her deeper into madness.  To her, she was possessed of the very evil she sought to destroy.  Rather than seek greater understanding of what she had, she sought a way to silence it.

Now, because she was untrained, the only ability that she had was that of telepathy.  Yet even so, the influx of voices into her head filled Urios with great self-loathing.  She put all of her not insignificant magickal knowledge and skill into excising that part of her she so hated.
You, the reader, living in the present with all the knowledge that did not exist in Urios' time may well have already guessed what happened.  Urios did successfully silence the voices unlocked in her head.  She created a new invocation that when cast upon herself, took away her telepathy.  Perhaps it was her joy at silencing her hated mind, perhaps it was something else.  The reason for the next momentous event in history is lost to history.  Whatever the reason, she invoked this new spell on her aide and together they discovered that that same weave that silenced her telepathy would grant it to another.  In that instant of discovery, Urios had the answer to all her needs.  The Psycians had the Frontacians bound in a chain of need.  She would remove that need, thus breaking that chain that bound her race, her rage.  She knew she could leverage house Zaarman to the height of power, for with this weave, the Frontacians would be free of the Psycians forever.

The Price of War

What remains of this history is little enough.  The war between the Frontacian Empire and the Psycians was long and brutal before it started.  However, once the war started, it was over in an instant.  The world has changed much since then.  The changes are so great, it could be said we are still feeling the repercussions of that brief moment of insanity.  The last part of this tale is difficult to tell.  Even though the event is long since past, as a Psycian the mere thought of it is difficult.  Nonetheless, I came here to record what happened, so record I must.

The Rise of the House Zaarman

True to Urios' vision, she was quickly able to leverage herself to the Trade Council.  This she did simply.  First, she did away with all the Psycians in her employ, replacing them with the lesser magi of her house.  The Trade Council heard of this and laughed to themselves at the idiocy of her madness.  To them, Urios had just doomed house Zaarman to poverty.  Apparently, this sentiment was agreed with by some of house Zaarman as well, for many of the house were found dead during those first few weeks, traces of webbing near at hand.

The Trade Council monitored the fall of house Zaarman with some amusement, always ready for amusement in these otherwise distressing times.  What they discovered was that the Zaarmans were not falling into poverty.  In fact, they were prospering, even more so than some of the elite houses.  Eventually, they sent a representative to investigate how this was possible.

Urios received the Council's factor warmly enough and when asked how her house was prospering so, she simply replied that the moneys saved from the Psycian commissions were greater than expected.  Urios knew she could have used her weave to gain a seat on the Council.  However, her memories of abuse made her unwilling to settle for that.  She wanted to remake the Council under her.  Perplexed but unable to gain any more information from her, the Council factor returned to report to the Council.  They, in turn, unable to understand how house Zaarman prospered, opted to wait and watch.

It came to pass that Urios learned of the discovery of the translocation aura.  With that, and her telepathy aura, she knew that magi could rule trade as they had never done before.  With the sure knowledge that Frontacians were the masters of magick, she started plotting the final disposition of the Psycians.  In the meantime, her house continued to prosper, becoming wealthier than nearly all the other houses.  Not only was her house free of the fees paid to the Psycians, but house Zaarman was also free of the misinformation the Psycians had been providing for years.  By having her own people performing the necessary communications, she was able to all but obliterate competition from outside sources.

All this was not lost on the Trade Council.  Eventually, they invited her to join their ranks, an act unheard of without her putting pressure first.  They simply could not ignore what was rapidly becoming such a wealthy household.  In response, she offered them a simple exchange.  She would give the Empire the tools necessary to be free of the Psycians.  In return, they would place her in charge of the Council.  Make her Empress of the Empire and she would end the Psycian meddling once and for all.

Now by its very nature, the Council was made up of the best traders in the Frontacian Empire.  As such, the thought of double-dealing was not completely foreign to them.  After some brief deliberation, the Council agreed to her exchange, fully planning on removing her should the need so arise.

So it was that at the end of the Age of Dominance, Urios Zaarman was named Empress of the Frontacian Empire and in her first, and last, act, she ordered the destruction of the Isle of Psycia.

The Death of Psycia

Magi are powerful.  We all know this.  However, the utter destruction of an island was beyond the capability of even the greatest of magi.  When the Trade Council asked, shocked, how Empress Urios planned to accomplish this unbelievable feat, she told them.  With the delight at seeing an age old blight exterminated, the Council agreed to her plan.  If any had the foresight to question the wisdom of the means, none spoke then.  By the time anyone did speak, it was hindsight speaking.

Common education makes reference to the magickal bridges of the Frontacians.  In this account, I have often cited their use by the Frontacians to further their ends.  Little is known as to how they worked.  The general theory is that they warped the very fabric of the world, bending it so as to allow instantaneous travel from one location to another.  The mechanics of the magickal bridges is not the same as the mechanics of the Psycian teleportation or the translocation aura.  In the case of the Psycian way, our philosophers tell us that we are linking into the Mind of the land and through our will, bringing us to another place.  The theory behind the translocation aura is similar, in that it requires that the person traveling have visited the destination.  The theory of translocation is that the magickal fabric that exists all around us is focused on the visualization of the mage.  Neither of these means, however, has the same capacity as the magickal bridges the Frontacians developed.

Urios' plan was a simple one.  Her research indicated that if a sufficiently large number of magickal bridges were built in sufficiently close proximity, the very bending of space would collapse in on itself.  Historical fact has since, to my great sadness, validated her research.

Records from the Frontacian Empire describe that the creation of a magickal bridge was a three-step process.  First, the anchors at both ends were built and infused with identical magickal resonance.  Second, magickal energies were infused into the corridor created by the magickal harmony between anchors.  Finally, the bridge was opened, creating portals on both sides.  Urios determined that six such bridges would be needed to destroy Psycia.  Five would be put at the extents of the island and the sixth, critical one, would be placed at the center.

The Isle of Psycia, being a client state of the Frontacian Empire, was totally accessible to the Frontacian engineers.  Thus, they were able to build the anchors for the dooming bridges without difficulty.

The Psycians had watched the rise of house Zaarman with growing concern.  They were aware that somehow, a Frontacian house had found a way to trade profitably without the assistance of Psycian communicators.  However, their own arrogance led them to believe that this was some strange coincidence and nothing more.  When Urios was pronounced Empress, the Psycians took note, but otherwise sat silent in the surety that they were too important to the Frontacians to be in any danger.

The sixth and final bridge was built within what was being described as the imperial residence on the Isle.  Urios had let it be known that each client state would have a central location designated as her home for when she was visiting.  She stated that when it was complete, she would hold court for her Psycian subjects.

Thus, the day came when all the bridges were complete and ready to be activated.  Urios traveled to Psycia to hold her court, naming that day an imperial holiday and demanding that all Psycians be in attendance.
There, upon a great and open field, the greater part of the Psycian population before her, Urios stood and gloated about her victory to come.  She planned to activate the final bridge herself, letting it destroy Psycia as she stepped through it.

Of what happened next, there is only one record, for none present to witness it survived, save one.  Urios' Arachnian aide was present on that day.  What he witnessed is lost to time, except for a brief mention in one of the Arachnian histories.

"And so Urios stood before the teeming masses, smiling in the knowledge that they were all doomed.  She said nothing to them.  She merely stood, a malevolent smile behind the mask of their beatific new empress.  Behind her I watched, knowing what was about to happen better than she ever could.  Today was a great day.  Victory was mine.  It was not total, but to catch two flies in one web is a greater victory than just one, and what juicy flies these were.  She stood there, and then, glee filling her voice, proudly screamed, "For all that you have done for us, we, the Frontacians, give our appropriate thanks."  She then turned to me, still smiling, and wove the final runes of the bridge.

"I considered letting her return with me, letting her face the wrath of her kin for what foolishness she had wrought, but some glimmer of kindness must have caught me, for I did not.  Better that she live for a moment, knowing what she had done, than die, torn apart by her council.  So, as we turned to step into the portal, the world around us already collapsing in on itself, I smiled up at her and bound her in my web.  Whether it was a trick of my mind or the warping of space, I do not know, but I heard her screaming my name for a very long second as I stepped through the portal.  She never could pronounce it."

The Aftermath

Thus ended the Frontacian Empire and the Isle of Psycia.  As predicted, space folded in on itself, taking the Isle of Psycia from this world in a matter of moments.  In those moments, every latent mind across the known world was brought to operancy by the death scream of thousands of minds.  What was not predicted, except perhaps by one Arachnian aide, was the resultant shock wave that erupted from every bridge anchor across the known world.  In the same instant the brought the destruction of the Psycian homeland, all the magickal bridges that gave the Frontacians their empire erupted in fire and magick gone wild before collapsing into oblivion.  Never would another magickal bridge exist to parallel those destroyed that day.  Although a few have been built since, they are always small bridges, covering short distances.

By design, most of the Frontacian garrisons spread throughout the world were housed in the building that served as bridge anchors.  Units were always ready to move to another location as reinforcements.  This advantageous stationing meant that as the bridges exploded, they obliterated the bulk of the Frontacian forces.  Those that survived were quickly decimated by the local populations.  Although they may not have understood what had happened, at least they knew that whatever it was, it was bad for their Frontacian keepers.

In that one brief moment of time, chaos ran unfettered through the world.  The Isle of Psycia was no more, and the Frontacian Empire, built on the magickal bridges now gone, was destroyed.  The Frontacians fell in on themselves, as their society collapsed under the weight of all their trade suddenly ceasing.  Internal strife ravaged the Frontacian homeland for centuries.

Of the rest of the world, there is little to say.  Those that had been brought low rose up and were once again free.  Any order that had been brought under the unifying force of the Empire dissolved back to the chaos of anarchy.  Eventually, the anarchy faded as each race sorted itself out and found its place in the new world order.  The Psycians who were not on the Isle on that damned day found each other and began to rebuild that which was lost as best they could.  Those of other races now aware of the Mind found occasional wandering Psycians and learned the ways of the Mind.  And for a long time, none were better off than they had been before, except perhaps for one Arachnian who had become a hero to his kind.

The Spider's Web

Upon a rock in the rogue's fields,
Sits a little Spider spinning slow,
Whilst the sun burns ablaze above,
I sit here and feel the wind blow,

I never knew the joy there was,
In listening to the cicadas buzz,
I hear their humming through the trees,
Carried by the gentle breeze,

The sky darkens and overcasts,
The gusts of wind become blasts,
I look into the sky of dark,
As the cloud move north, toward the park,

I strain to see the clouds up high,
Who seem to litter the sky,
I see that from which they are made,
Cicadas the color of jade,

They move toward the center of Spur,
Driven, as it were,
The buzzing peaks,
And havoc on my hears it wreaks,

A Dragon like me will do no wrong,
But for battle I have waited long,
I yearn to fight,
And so I ready my blade of light,

North I run until I reach,
The area where one can breach,
The lands of wild and tooth and fur,
Finds a gate, to meet the Spur,

Along the street of noble's living,
Whose residents are never giving,
An army of jade awaits my arrival,
They see me as their only rival,

For no one else is near around,
Only cicadas abound,
With gleaming teeth, razor-made,
And sparkling with the essence of jade,
They bite through my mail,
I shriek and wail,
Blood pours from gaping wounds,
Then there comes a holy boon,

Warriors come from north to see,
And reveal the secrets of a mystery,
What was it that made the sky so black,
And what then caused the light it lacked,

An army of green before them stood,
Each one covered from tunic to hood,

All I saw was green and brown,
And soon down,
Came flashes of attack,
The cicada's had fallen and all went black,

When I woke the three monks who had given their best,
Were gone, and so I went to rest,
For my best was not quite good enough,
Because the cicadas play rough,

I lie down in a clearing, in the fields,
Knowing a strong heart is all you must wield,
For I was lusting battle, just to kill,
And no one ever will,
Win a battle with only blade,
This is how the world was made,

I sit and watch the spider spin,
I'll be ready should this happen again,
Under the sun ablaze,
I reflect upon my battle days.

The preceding was to warn the young adventurer, no battle can be one with a sword. No one has ever fought and one without the courage to back up the steel which they put their faith in.  "Be true unto yourself, and you will prevail, be fool hearted and boast, and you will surely fail.  Be true unto yourself, and you will win, be fool hearted and boast, and you will never begin to see the joys of battle."

May peace always follow you,
 
Grindel

Rebirth
By Rahvin Telemon

I have been asked by many about the origins of the Anthian race, by both young Anthians and those of other races who were just curious. So I have decided to translate for all, the song of how the Anthians came to be, as it was sung to me by my father Domon Telemon. Please sit back, close your eyes and let the winds of my voice carry you back.

In the beginning, and as she always has been, Elindale was alive in the world. She was one with the flowers and grasses, just as she was part of the squirrels in the trees and birds in the air. Plants and animals were not the only things alive in this world, there were young races beings at work in the world. Beings who trod across the face of the world, encroaching on the temples and sanctuaries that Elindale had made of the forests and and surging rivers. Elindale knew that she would have to do something to make these beings understand their place in the world.  

She began searching someone to be her emissary, one that would embody the beauty that she had brought to the world and still command the respect of all those they would encounter. Searching throughout the forests, mountains, and seas she did not find any species greater in beauty or stronger in self than the Anthiana. Anthiana were a race of great flying birds, that lived high in the mountains of the Southern Isle. These graceful beings showed an intelligence beyond that of normal animals and a deep bond of family unity unmatched by any other. She had found her emissaries.

Taking these great birds, she remade them into the Anthians you know today. Strong, proud, wise, and beautiful winged beings. They were to rival anything ever created before or since. Elindale charged the Anthians with a duty, she said "You are my creations, but your destinies are your own. I give this great gift to you, but the gift comes at a price. You are to be my emissaries, you will be examples to all those on this world. You are to travel beyond, beyond the high passes, beyond the great sea and even beyond the dry deserts. For you I set this task. Protect all that is mine, defend all that is weak, and if necessary give up your own lives so that life itself may go on."

Accepting the duty with great pride, Anthians began spreading across the world. Many died in the days that came, and also many new friends made. We lost our innocence in those first years after the our Rebirth, but gained a knowledge of the world and the treasures it could offer up. We did our duty, we served Elindale not because of the Commandment, we did it because it was what was in our hearts.  

Now you may ask as to how some of us today do not follow Elindale or her teachings. Well, after many years of traveling the world, living and dying in service to our goddess, Elindale did release us from our pledge. She asked only that we stand ready to heed her call.

As time slowly passed some of our race heard the calling of new challenges and devotions.  We spread across the world seeking teachers in the new arts.  Anthian men and women sought out the best teachers of sword, spell, healing, and commerce. Those pursuits led to new gods to worship and new challenges to meet.  Diversifying and scattering our young race across the world.

I sing to you the story of our Rebirth, as it was sung to me by my father and his father to him. Sing on children of Elindale, sing until the hard walls around the heart crumble and fall, sing until the eyes of the blind open with new sight, and sing until what was forgotten is learned anew.

History of the Mystic Phantom Dragon Inn By Dravon Soulkill

Many years ago, in a time when there were dragons, a mystic gray dragon plagued Kylial.  Men would hunt far and wide to kill this dragon.  The dragon was the only one who seemed to be stuck here after the War of Magic concluded. He continued to cause great chaos throughout Kylial.

There was a great hunt and every man went.  There was a great battle between the men and the dragon.  Most of the men were killed there, yet some survived but not long enough to make it home.

Ceerrus, the only survivor, gathered his family and moved to the town of Covenant.  Ceerrus decided that he would construct an inn.  He told his son, Burke, about the dragon and the powers that it possessed.  Shortly after, Ceerrus died.  Burke made it his duty to hunt down and kill this dragon.

The dragon had tracked Ceerrus to Covenant, because he hated mankind and wanted no survivors left from the battle.  Burke sought out to find the dragon after collecting his equipment, but he did not have far to look as the dragon had found him at the partially constructed inn.

The dragon and Burke fought with much yelling and screaming.  Burke remembered the dragon's true name, Etienne, whispered to him on his father's deathbed. The dragon's powers failed to defeat Burke, and soon died by his sword.  Burke then claimed the scales, claws and teeth from Etienne's corpse and soon disposed of the rest.  Those trophies were to decorate the inn.

After the death of Etienne, Burke finished his inn.  He proudly decorated the inn walls with the parts of the dragon.  The inn became known as the Mystic Dragon Inn.  He eventually married a local woman and had a son named Rendel.

Rendel, who never saw a dragon, didn't believe what his father boasted.  Since no one living had seen a living dragon, he dismissed the story to senility. Rendel married, but his wife died during the birth of his only daughter.  Due to Rendel's continuous absence in the battlefields, Squeak was raised by her grandfather.

Squeak was the name given by her grandfather.  She began working the inn while young.  While she was working in the inn one day, she received word that her father was killed in battle.  Months went by and she realized that soon she would be running the inn, because her grandfather was sick getting worse.  At his deathbed, Burke enlightened Squeak about the entire story of Etienne.  As she was growing up, he never told her all of it... just bits and pieces to keep her attention.  That night, he passed away quietly in his sleep.

Months more passed, and while cleaning the storeroom of the inn, Squeak heard a noise in the dining area.  She went out to see what it was.  She blinked but still saw the strange shape in front of her.  It didn't go away, and soon she realized that it was the ghost of the dragon her grandfather had slain.  After many weeks of these appearances, she figured that dragon was haunting the inn.

Shortly thereafter, she decided to rename the inn.  It is now known as the Mystic Phantom Dragon Inn.  Etienne's powers were never completely understood, and to this day, his ghost still appears...

The Wings of a Newborn Sun

Rise, the darkness falls,
Ascend a stair of platinum stars
To face at last a destiny
In centuries past was forged as yours.

Rise, the shadows greet you,
In their velvet black embrace, entreat you
To taste the dream, so real it seems-
Reach out and grasp the night.

Rise, the pain that jars you,
Chills your bones, you must withstand,
Stand and fight but not alone;
Sheltered by the touch of nameless hands.

Rise, the flame surrounds you
White-hot pillars flicker 'round you;
Fear not the dream; embrace, believe
The destiny that has found you.

Rise, from ancient ashes scattered
New strength searing through your veins-
Where the remnants of your past are shattered
So a new life now begins.

Rise, see how your fire shines
In the sun of a morning sky,
Rise, and put your hand in mine-
Rise, for now we fly.

Panick my love,

Already I begin to question the wisdom of taking this journey without ye. I find that the sun shines the less brightly, the birds sing the less sweetly, and the summer breeze is not as comfortable as it ought be with ye gone from my side.

Tis been but one day and my heart sorely grieves for the sight of ye, the loving touch of ye, and the blessed sound of thine voice whether it be speaking words of love or telling tales fraught with humor and jest.

Ye are my world and this day has but shown me the truth of things.

I have decided to keep a journal of my travels not only to share the journey with ye, but for a selfish reason - for in scribing these words, I feel as if ye are all the much closer to me and it fills my heart with joy.

                                                                                     Armonius

Day 1

I left straight from the Temple training grounds after completing sharp weapons training, loaded by pack, and took the Southern road from Spur. It still grieves me to see how many have left our home due to the unjust taxes. Were that I could aright this wrong. I fear that only time will demonstrate the folly of trying to bleed our people dry.

Once clear of Meetpoint and the trade route I saw nary a soul but for some Rijom hunters who looked on without interest and I made good time. The road is lonely yet it gives me time to think upon not only the recent changes in my life but upon the request of my uncle to return to our mountain home with great haste.

I am filled with trepidation for this summons, for it has been nigh on five years since I left and have little idea what to expect upon my return. I am not the Hithual that left there so long ago.

I set camp this night on the plains below the Southlands. The Great Bluffs are still in sight and something familiar to mine eyes provides some comfort in my loneliness.

Day 2

I awoke much refreshed from the weariness the last weeks of events had imparted upon me. I should say, though, that I begrudge not the lost hours of slumber, for my life has been much enhanced by the presence of ye in my life. The long and sad series of farewells and the constant strife to fend off chaos have also taken their toll on my spirit.

Today I reached the crossroads where I hit the Great Throughway. I could take this route to the Great Divide, yet is a roundabout path. I am considering a much shorter, yet infinitely more dangerous route - the road through the Dagskraad.

It has been many a year since I passed that way last and then only in company with my father, a warrior of Odarous and a party of our finest Hithual warriors. The remembrances of what we found there can still bring a chill when I reflect upon it - for there we discovered a host of undead and our blades barely served to fend them off as we made our escape. It is primarily from this experience that my desire to gain some degree of skill at turning these foul spirits originated. We never did discover the source of this evil, yet it appeared focused in the ruins of the large keep which guarded the pass in olden times. We never reached the keep, as the horde of undead could not be defeated by our party of warriors. Although none fell, several of our number refused to venture forth from our home for a long time afterwards.

Armed with my increasing ability Unknown has granted me to return these tortured souls from whence they came, I fear this path perhaps less than I ought, yet I am keen to take advantage of the much shorter distance it affords.

Day 3

The day dawned but dimly at my camp not far west of the crossroads. The clouds have rolled in and brought a light summer rain which does some to lessen the heat of the season.

Toward mid-morning I had a bit of excitement to break the routine of my journey. A band of brigands thought to take advantage of a lone traveler on the highway in a stretch of thick woods. A quick survey of the four ragged youths told me I had little to fear so I drew the dagger ye gave me to carry and danced the blades for but a short while with the four. I marked each so as to leave a few scars for thought, relieved them of their barely serviceable weapons and bade them good day and to mend their wicked ways. It will probably not do much good, yet I continue to hope that peace will spread in our world.

I left the road at mid-day and began to travel the much-neglected path into the Dagskraad. I camp now on a sheltered bluff overlooking the Greenwood. Tomorrow will see the climb to the pass and the keep ruins.

Day 4

I give great praise to Unknown that I live to write this entry - for today was one I shall not soon, if ever, forget. I apologize for the raggedness of my penwork, but I have suffered a wound that is beyond my healing capability.

Yesterday's light rain turned overnight into full-blown thunder and lightning storms. The traveling conditions were not ideal, but with little choice I wrapped my cloak tightly against the weather and continued on as I was already somewhat exposed on the winding mountain trails.

I pressed on towards the keep and as I neared I could sense an increasing focus of hate and chaos. I saw nothing and came within sight of the ruins by early afternoon. The keep itself straddles the narrowest portion of the pass and the road leads through two great walls with a tower, gate, portcullis, and causeway on each side of the pass. Although much of the keep has fallen to rubble, this central portion is still much intact. I suppose one could climb around the keep to either side after many hours of effort...but the poor weather and my confidence to face whatever was contained therein, led me to choose the direct route through the gates. This confidence almost proved the end of me.

There is much magick I have never seen and today I learned of a bit more. As I entered the keep I saw that the gates were in such disrepair as to be inoperable....they literally hung from the hinges open wide. Yet even as I passed through, a great wailing and keening filled the air and where the gate should stand appeared a great wall of bluish flame.

Near-simultaneous with the wall's appearance, a fair-sized host of undead began to issue forth from the shadows around me. I managed just to reach a raised dais in the center of the square formed between the two keep walls and here made my stand. Twas little approached me that I had not encountered before and I gave a short prayer of thanks to Unknown that he had bade me to improve my skill in this gift he had bestowed upon me of turning the undead. I found myself surrounded on all sides by skeletons, zombies, wraiths, wights and spirits.....but this was not the same Hithual they had faced years ago. Each fell to my scathing touch and dust and ashes piled around the dais in ever-deepening layers. Their sheer numbers made taking the time to cast spells of vigor and comfort impractical, yet Unknown heeded each and every one of my urgent prayers to refresh my fatigue.

Although seemingly long, it could not have been but a half hour that this encounter lasted. I had received but a few minor wounds and after quickly healing them I rose and found to my surprise that walls of the blue flame still filled each of the gates. I scanned the courtyard and saw four skeletal knights , one approaching from each quadrant. I had faced such creatures before, but knew not my ability to turn these foul denizens of hell. They appeared shrouded in an orange mist and small flames flickered o'er their drawn greatswords. Each was arrayed in full battle plate and where eyes would be seen in a man only two orbs of red glared in hate. As I prepared to call upon Unknown to channel the turning power through me, my Master spoke unto me...."These are beyond even your skill at turning my faithful son...ye must rely upon your skill at the blade". 

I thereupon drew the blade the master Rehas crafted for me and set my shield against their oncoming attack. I cleared my mind and set about the business at hand. Set upon form four sides, I was sorely pressed. Swing, parry, block, spin...over and over in an intricate dance of steel, sinew and strength. Wound after wound these creatures of death took and I but a few, yet I continued to grow weary as they seemed not to flag even a bit. It was well into the battle that I discovered their weakness. A high swing to the head resulted in the helmet of one being cloven from its shoulder.....a high-pitched shriek filled the air as the form before me quickly turned to ash and pieces of mail clattered to the stones. As the odds evened, I concentrated my attacks high and in this way dispatched the other three knights.
Again I sat and treated my wounds, cast a few magicks to restore my flagging strength and said a prayer of thanks to my Master. Yet even as I accomplished these things I became filled with premonition that the fight had not yet seen its end. Warned by this second-sense I turned and looked behind me....

There stood a tall dark form arrayed in tattered robes of black, the borders of which were decorated with arcane symbols. Its ghostly white skin was mottled and wrinkled as if with the deterioration of death's decay and even at a distance of ten cubits the stench of the grave filled my lungs. It carried a staff of some dark-hued twisted wood, atop which stood a small globe of red clutched in fingers of wood which much resembled a creature's claw. I had never in my travels seen such a creature, but it was clearly not of the living world. After but a brief moment, but I do not know how or why, I recognized it for what it was.....a lich; the foul spirit and body of a once-live necromancer, whose soul had been given over to chaos and evil to extend its presence in the world of the living. By its looks, this one had been long drawing together its followers and I realized now what was the focus of the troubles in this region of the mountains.
As it approached I saw its twisted mouth open and a mere hissing whisper come forth from its tortured face. I heard words in my head, yet they had not come as sound unto my ears. It spoke thus..."Ye have done great damage unto the forces of my Master and have delayed that which had been set in motion long ago....yet ye have not won. Take what pride ye may in your courage and strength, for the feeling will be short-lived....as will ye be. When your heart be stilled and your eyes be dimmed know that I will make ye even like mine self and ye shall stand beside me before a Master greater than any ye have known".

Beyond the lich a dark shadow appeared. It coalesced into the shape of a great vulture and I knew now who was the Master he spoke of. Yet as the first shadow appeared so did another which stood beside me....this one appeared into a shape I have come to love, that of a great tiger. Time seemed to stand still as the Vulture shrieked at the Tiger and the Tiger roared in return. After but awhile, Unknown spoke to me a second time..."Today the Balance must be maintained. Ye must face this champion of Taath without my support, though it grieves me to say so. Yet as I may not interfere, nor can my brother Taath, for the day of reckoning between he and I has not yet come. Remember, my son, the healing touch". Both shadows, the Vulture and the Tiger, vanished and I stood in the falling rain in the deepening gloom with only this undead necromancer before me.

I attacked with fury, yet this creature's staff met and parried each of my blows as if he could read the strike ere I began it. Even while the right hand manipulated the staff so the left wove spell after spell and the runes that encircled its damned head coalesced into all manners of magickal attack. It threw fire, lightning, acid, fear, darkness and chaos in multiple forms and for each I resisted two more found their mark and I was soon bleeding from a number of not inconsequential wounds. Knowing that calling upon Unknown would prove fruitless, I relied upon what skill I possessed in non-magickal healing and this at least let me arrest the loss of life-giving blood from my wounds.

It was at this point that the lich closed and instead of casting another of its foul magicks reached out and grasped my blade arm. Its touch to my shoulder brought a searing cold pain which rapidly spread down my arm as my sword clattered to the ground. I dropped my shield as well and scrambled away as the coldness was replaced by numbness and my sword-arm rendered useless.

I turned to the other form of attack available to me....magick. I let loose with every runespell I could muster. Fire, lightning, blindness, sleep in every form I knew and magick clashed against magick as we both wove runes in the air above our heads. Yet this attack too, seemed to have little effect on the creature and I began to despair even as my wounds increased and worsened and my strength flagged. I knew this could not last much longer and my thoughts turned to all that I should lose should I fail. Then I recalled the last words of my Master..."the healing touch". 

If skill at arms and mastery of magick could not touch this creature, perhaps another way was needed. Even as it closed for the kill I cast a healing spell at the lich....at last a reaction! For this creature of death, healing was an anathema. I cast comfort, strength, healing, restore life....every good strengthening and healing spell I knew. As each contacted, the creature's discomfort and obvious pain grew. I prayed for its soul and blessed and forgave it as it screamed in that scratching, whispered shrieks and moans that were its voice. At the last I embraced it and smiled. Even as my strength failed, I saw it fall and stir no more.

I know not how long I lay there, but it was nigh on sunset when I awoke. Where I had seen the lich fall the rough shape of a man was etched as if by acid into the stones of the courtyard, yet nothing else remained. I healed my remaining wounds, yet my sword arm still recalled the cold of the lich's touch and resisted all of my healing efforts. I could at least feel my hand yet was unable to hold a blade in its grasp.

I scanned the courtyard one last time, but all was quiet and I felt nothing of the earlier aura the place had possessed. I hurriedly gathered my things and left the ruins through the other gate and traveled until it became too dark to safely do so. After setting camp I said my nightly devotions to Unknown and knew that he stood behind me once again. It is not mine place to question the affairs of the Gods, yet I cannot but wonder what this affair might have been to involve both Taath and Unknown in such a direct manner. Perhaps one day I shall find out.

Day 5

I slept till long past the sun rose and woke much refreshed. The ache of my arm has lessened and my grasp is stronger, yet at this rate it will be a while longer ere I can handle a sword. Should the need arise, I bless Panick for the gift of the dagger which will be light enough to wield with my sword-arm. Perhaps I should learn to fight with my left-hand as a precaution.

The storms have passed and the day is filled with sunlight and a light breeze. My spirit was much uplifted today as I wound my way down from the Dagskraad and regained the highway in the vicinity of Gleron's Ford. Towards sunset, as I exited the northern reach of the forest and entered the Plains of Nanthe, I gained sight of my mountain home - the Dragon Spire, a lone peak far from its neighbors in the range which forms the northwestern reach of the Great Divide. This journey to my ancestral home will end tomorrow after a long day's march. What I will find there is a mystery to me, yet I will be  glad to see kin and friends I have not seen these five years and more.

Day 6

Even as I write this my eyelids droop, as it is very late. The final leg of the journey was uneventful. I was surprised to meet a heavily armed party of my clan on patrol while still quite a way from the cavern entrance. This spoke much for the concern of my people over the security of our home and the Captain told tales of strange creatures and wanderers in this section of the Divide. I suspect this is true elsewhere as well.

My homecoming was a joyous one. I was met by my uncle, Relgarius, the current Colinth-tek (Forge Master) of the clan; my mother, Alyssa; and a multitude of cousins.

A great feast was declared in my honor and the festivities lasted until late in the evening. I was truly surprised to find myself given a high degree of deference and respect, and it turns out in part to be due to several of our traders having met Kraggon Rockhard, of our own Forge in Spur, on his travels through the region. They, my kin, were well aware of many of my exploits and accomplishments in Spur and I found myself blushing Panick, even without ye here. Would that ye had been here by my side for the feasting, drinking and dancing I would have been the happiest Hithual in the Divide.

Ere the feast began, my mother drew me aside and together we walked to the Shrine of Rinanni. I have not spoken much yet of my family, but it is due to her that I am much of the Hithual ye have wed. Ye should know that my clan follows but two of the Gods ye are familiar with, Odarous and Rinanni. It was nigh on fifty years ago when Unknown first spoke unto me deep in the tunnels beneath our home and from that day forward I was marked as different from the other young of our clan. For a great while I kept this encounter as a secret and my increasing distance from Odarous and my frequent wanderings to find my own way led my father to ever-growing anxiety over my behavior. It was my mother, and I bless her for her great wisdom, who told me I must follow my destiny and showed me at the same time how that did not necessarily have to conflict with the destinies of my father, family or clan.

My mother is perhaps the greatest Heart of Rinanni in the clan and she used all her power to heal my wounded sword-arm. It is much better now and she assures me that in but a few days it will be as good as new.

We spoke of our marriage, Panick, and I told her of ye and my feelings for you. Ere I could even finish speaking, she smiled broadly and said ye must be the one for me, for she could but see the light of love in my eyes and hear it in my words. I could think of no greater compliment from my mother, for she is very wise in the ways of love and friendship  and a great match-maker amongst my people. Many would judge a mixed-race marriage like ours with some degree of scorn, yet I am my mother's son in this and people are people. She blessed our happiness and looks forward to meeting ye. She did add, jokingly, that not a few of the Hithual lasses I grew up with were sorely grieved at the word that I had married.

At last I asked her of the business that had caused my uncle to summon me here, but she would not speak of it. She urged me to enjoy the festivities, for tomorrow at council would yield answers to all my questions.

Day 7

Today was spent in council with breaks only for meals. I was given the seat of honor on my uncle's right in the Council Chamber. The oldest and wisest of our clan were there for discussions which covered a wide range of topics.

The first, and the prime reason my uncle had summoned me was Agouth Sira! I swear that I am cursed to have to deal with that Taathian rebel until the end of my days. I might add as a side note, that I noticed his name on the Guild List ere I left, indicating that he had trained after he had said he left Spur for good. It was about six months ago that Agouth first left Spur and returned to the Divide. It was upon his subsequent unanticipated return to Spur that he spoke of converting many of the Hithual clans to the worship of Taath. Khain Greyheart, the First Warder of Odarous and myself were much grieved that this might even be a possibility and the subsequent chain of events led to Agouth being labeled Kragar, or "disowned" in the common tongue. It turns out that in part what Agouth said is truth. Many Hithual, although their total number is undetermined, of the other clans and a few of my own, have left their peoples and are gathering in the Divide somewhere north of here to start a clan devoted to Taath. This sorely grieves all of us and the number of Kragar grows daily. Trouble will soon grow of this turn of events, I am sure.

My people know little of Taath and have asked that I share my knowledge not only of Taath, but of the other Gods in our world. It was agreed that education would do much to help our people see and understand the beliefs and viewpoints of other faiths.

Along these same lines, I was much surprised (an pleased) to find my Master, Unknown has been busy too in the Divide and a small number of the younger Hithual have had "visitations" and now worship Unknown. The council has authorized the establishment of  a Shrine to Unknown and I am to dedicate and sanctify it and establish a hierarchy while I am here. This fills me with great joy to spread the good word of my Master amongst my own kin, and I feel the less lonely here for being able to share my faith with others.

The last major discussion focused on my brother, Draffut Sabrestrike. I know I have not yet told ye the story of how my surname, Undermount came to be, yet that it involved a dragon. It is a long tale and I shall not tell it here, but at this point it is only relevant in that ere my clan lived here in the great cavern of the Dragonspire it was the home of an ancient fourth stage dragon, long since departed from the world.
 
With the increasing chaos and evil in the world and the unrest amongst the Hithual clans, the council fears for the long-term security of our home, and rightly so. It is for this reason, and I am greatly honored for the trust they put in my judgment, that they have asked me to approach Draffut and Danaira about making their lair and home here in the Dragonspire when they reach their later stages. Oh, what a beautiful way for us to remain close all our days, for I know that they should be happy here and my clan do them great honor. None of us know what the years may bring and third and fourth stage are decades away for my brother and sister, yet I shall plant this seed in him and see what grows of it.

Day 8

Tomorrow I shall leave to begin the return journey which will bring me back to you and for this I am exceedingly happy. Today was one I shall never forget, for it was filled with many simple joys.

At dawn today, I dedicated the new Shrine of Unknown. Call it fate if ye will, but the site chosen was none other than the small grotto in which Unknown first spoke to me those long years ago. Our new followers number but ten, but the one who was elected to be their leader reminds me much of myself in younger days before I became the sometimes too-serious Hithual ye have come to love. I shall be interested to see how this new group develops as time passes, but they are a group of our finest youngsters and I am sure will do our faith proud. They have promised to keep in touch with our Temple in Spur that we may aid them in any manner possible.

The remainder of the day was spent in visiting various places and groups....I spent time with the High Priest and Priestess of each of the other Shrines, visited the Hithual school and spoke to the youngsters of the clan, dined with the garrison and spent some time with the warriors in training. My sword-arm still aches yet I did not embarrass myself at handling a blade.

I spent dinner with only my mother and uncle and we talked of old times, my father, and the many misadventures of my youth. For once I was slightly glad that ye were not here, for many of the stories made me blush. My mother reminded me that this pain is but delayed since she will tell them all unto ye when at last ye meet.

Tonight, ere I retired for the evening, I visited the grave of my father. I wish he were here to speak with, for he would be surprised to see that his son had become much like him. I miss him greatly and there were too many things unsaid between us when he fell.

My home is a much simpler place than Spur and this visit has been a much-needed break from the intense activity that seems to surround us wherever we go, you and I.

Day 9

I am on the road again, traveling in company with a small group of our traders. We have a wagon and horses and will make good time along the highway....no shortcuts this time, yet with wheel and horse my return trip shall take about the same amount of time.

This morning ere I left, I again met for a short while with the council. Both ye and I, Panick have been inscribed in the Clan Book of Life! This is a great honor for both of us, for the purpose of this book is to document for posterity the deeds and accomplishments of our clan. Not all are entered, but only those who have made some contribution to the betterment of the clan. I am the youngest ever to be entered in its rolls and ye are not only the first non-Hithual, but the first follower of Sa so to be honored. This also signifies that, at least among the Undermount clan, ye shall be accorded all the rights and honor due to one of the blood. 

The council has also determined to send a party of our warriors to the keep ruins to establish an outpost and ensure the shorter route remains clear. This will do much to enhance trade and communications between the Divide and Spur.

Although the good-byes were long and sad, it shall not be as long ere I return here and the next time ye shall be with me. My mother sends her love and welcomes ye to the family as her daughter.

Days 10-11

Yesterday and today were very uneventful. We have made good progress and met few on the road and there have been no untoward incidents. I fear for the trader's fortune though, as a good portion of his cargo is in casks of Hithual Ale. We have been steadily drinking his profits at each and every rest and they have resulted in much jest and merry-making far into the evenings. I am sure the din of drunken Hithuals singing loudly and raucously has done a bit to scare away even the heartiest of potential foes.

Day 12

Early today I left the caravan as they continued east from the crossroads and I turned north towards Spur. I am camped at the same spot I chose the first evening of my journey. I am looking forward to being home and seeing ye and the "family". I am even looking somewhat forward to diving back into my work, for I am much refreshed in spirit and mind and there is much to be done.

It is my hope that ye at least find these words entertaining. I have enjoyed writing them much more than I at first thought I would, for I am but an adequate author at best. The blade is my best quill, mine enemies the most suitable scroll, and victory the finest result of my labor.

Here ends this chapter in the Journal of Armonius Undermount, First Lord of Spur

Dear Sir:

It has come to my attention that you are a Forum Leader.  As you may well know, Forum Leaders are an endangered species, since they rarely survive their first week of leading forums.  We of the Save the Spotted Forum Leader Society (SSFLS) are devoted to the care, maintenance, defense, and protection of this rare and precious creature.

Therefore, we have determined you a Forum Leader in Need, and placed you under our protection.  You will receive defense in cases where you have not erred but people, with their mortal faults, claim you have.  You will be protected from as much of the world as possible, although it is more than likely you have already come in contact with at least some of it.  You will receive friendship and companionship when our busy schedules allow it.  You will also be given flea dips semi-annually to make sure that one of the last remaining members of this endangered, protected species doesn't come down with Lyme Disease.  No ranchers will be allowed to build large casino hotels anywhere near you, unless they pay large sums of money to us to safely move you from the area.  We are a non-profit organization (at least to the IRS...  but you don't get any of the money, so why do you need to know about it?) and we are completely dedicated to the protection and survival of the rare creature known as the Forum Leader.  You are now under our protection, and anyone who flames or otherwise attacks you without sufficient certified cause will be forced to suffer the Wrath of Chelestra (TM).

Cold as the winter wind,
In the early morning.
No one by my side
To lift my heart
From the depths of despair.

Blind to the world around,
And fooled into thinking
That surrounded by those
I know and love, 
Could keep me afloat.

The absence that tears the heart,
Is too great to suffer.
Without my chosen at my side,
I am alone, I'll never be home.
