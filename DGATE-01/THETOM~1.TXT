__________________________________________________

PREAMBLE
Over the years, the Leuian race in the Spur has progressed far beyond the 
description of a Leuian in the Dragon's Gate manual. Leuian role players 
have developed a rich and vibrant culture and this manuscript is meant to 
pickup where the manual left off, providing the new Leuian role-player 
with expanded guidelines and to help them understand the culture and 
history that the experienced players have built. 

WRITINGS ON THE LEUIAN WARRIOR SOCIETY
Floating in the middle of the high seas is an island, christened Leuia by its 
inhabitants . Standing proud on its rocky shores, are rank upon rank of the 
most fearsome warriors ever to be unleashed upon a unsuspecting world. 
Militaristic and bred for combat, they are born with one singular purpose, 
the relentless pursuit of honor.

Leuians allow only three other ideals to take root in their lives: battle, 
love, and wrath. For a Leuian, battle is the fire that stirs, the truest test of 
ones courage, and every Leuian earnestly prays that their death will come 
in honorable battle. Battle or violence is also a means to an end for every 
Leuian's vast temper and wrath. When one is so single-minded of purpose, 
one has little time for distraction or the source of that distraction. Leuian 
warriors will not hesitate to show disdain in the form of legendary rage 
and sharpened claws to that which keeps them from their goal in life.

It is said that the Leuian heart beats with fire unlike none other; their sheer 
passion for expression is beyond compare. While their lust for battle can 
alarm, their ability to love can stir even the coldest heart. A Leuian's love is 
so deep that there have been cases of Leuian's dying of sorrow the very 
day their Khat'sara dies. The ritual of Khat'sara states that once mated a 
Leuian cannot lifemate ever again in their lives, even upon the death of 
their Khat'sara. However, many Leuian's do not require a ritual to guide 
them in this matter. If their Khat'sara dies, they have no wish to ever mate 
again. 

Over the years the Leuian race has stood the test of time, through many 
conflicts and hardships; as any Leuian will tell you, it is due to that honor-
bound warrior society from which they came, the society that sees only 
honor and dishonor, right and wrong, strong and weak, war and peace 
and nothing more. It is what Leuian's refer to as the great "Tar'na" which 
translated means the great simplicity  of our society.

WRITINGS ON THE TARR'KHATS OF LEUIAN SOCIETY
The Leuian Society is by far the most honor conscious civilization ever to 
be unleashed upon the world. It is therefore an issue of deep concern 
when a Leuian goes astray from the beliefs that all Leuian's are expected to 
hold true.

Leuian's who choose  the life of a thief or who choose to devote their lives 
to the god of thieves find themselves hated and scorned by their families, 
Pride and people. To the honorable Leuian, there is nothing more wicked 
than a thief. Anyone who would dedicate their life to the profession of 
lying, stealing and backstabbing the innocent is the very lowest form of 
existence. While a thief of any race is to be hated with passion,  a Leuian 
thief is an outright abomination in the eyes of their kin, a virtual walking 
contradiction in terms that should receive the harshest of consideration.

Leuian thieves or those who choose to follow the god of thieves are 
referred to as "Tarr'khats" by the honorable portion of Leuian society. The 
term Tarr'khat loosely translated means "worthless coward, dishonored 
outcast, or miserable scum of the lowest form." Tarr'khats are not allowed 
to join Leuian Prides, and are shunned from all Leuian culture. 

The god of thieves, Set, is the most hated religious figure in Leuian culture. 
Leuian's openly refuse to even speak his name, referring to him only as the 
"nameless one" and his followers as "those of the nameless god." 

For those thieves or followers of the nameless one outside of Leuia, a tense 
life exists between themselves and the honorable Leuians who, like them, 
have immigrated to other lands. Any Prides the honorable Leuians form 
outside Leuia prohibit thieves and followers of the nameless god. 
Furthermore, honorable Leuians do not congregate or associate with 
thieves, and for the most part attempt to mask their outright desire to tear 
them to bits. For the Tarr'khat and the honorable Leuian living outside of 
Leuia, it is an uneasy peace that borders on outright battle at any given 
time.

______________________________________________________
THE CUSTOMS AND BELIEFS OF 
            THE LEUIAN PEOPLE
______________________________________________________

PREAMBLE 
Leuian warrior's have an extremely powerful sense of custom and 
tradition, and every meaningful part of Leuian's life is marked by some 
ancient practice or ritual. The saying "Blood alone doth not a Leuian make" 
refers to the great respect that those Leuian's who follow and uphold 
Leuian principles and traditions receive. These traditions are as old as the 
Leuian race and furnish the discipline that builds every Leuian's legendary 
will. In addition, they provide the foundation of culture that is intensely 
defended and respected by every honorable Leuian. 

THE ANCIENT RITUAL OF KHAT'SARA
The Leuian act of  lifemate. 

When two Leuians fall in love, they perform the ritual of Khat'sara and take each other as 
lifemates. The Khat'sara begins with the ritual of the One Moon. A Leuian asks his or her 
love to be their Khat'sara. The proposing Leuian presents the potential Khat'sara with a 
token of love, usually something of great worth to the proposing Leuian. The potential 
Khat'sara accepts the token and keeps it for a time equal to one moon, during which they 
search their heart for an answer to the proposition of Khat'sara. This period of "One 
Moon" is consider extremely sacred and important to the potential Khat'sara as they must 
make a critical decision to accept or decline the rite of Khat'sara, knowing full well that if 
they accept it is a pledge beyond death. If, at the end of one moon, the potential 
Khat'sara returns the token to the proposing Leuian and has decided not to enter the pact 
of Khat'sara, then is no dishonor or shame in this. If the prospective Khat'sara keeps the 
token, the couple has pledged to become lifemates. 

The Khat'saras then repeat vows of love to each other, and upon completion of 
the ritual, become bonded for life. The bond cannot broken. There is no such 
thing as divorce in Leuian culture, and adultery is so dishonorable as to make it 
unthinkable to the Leuian mind. When a Leuian is betrothed to be a Khat'sara, or 
is already a Khat'sara, their entire existence is promised to only one other person. 
Other Leuians tread very carefully around Khat'saras or those who are engaged to 
be Khat'saras, as it is considered an unbelievably high insult to kiss, make improper 
advance or even touch and embrace one who is promised. The bond between 
two Khat'saras is so strong that it is unbreakable even in the event of the death of 
one of the participants. The widowed Khat'sara continues on with their life but 
will never again take another lifemate.

There is perhaps no other ritual which is so cherished as the Khat'sara. It is
the ultimate expression of a Leuian's honor, passion, respect, and love. The 
fact that once mated they never mate again is a testament to a Leuian's 
unbelievable sense of honor and mythical willpower. 

EXAMPLE OF THE VOWS OF KHAT'SARA 
The Khatsaras go off to some private place known only to them. They
sit across from each other and recite personal vows of love to each other
The ritual is completed by the recital of the final vow of Khat'sara:

 "Make of our Minds one Mind
Make of our Vows one last Vow
Make of our Hearts one Heart
Only Death will part us now……

Make of our Kin's one Kin
Make of our Lives one Life
Make of our Love one true Love….

One Mind, One Vow, One Heart, 
One Kin, One Life, One Love
Even death won't part us now"

THE RITE OF KLAAW'VOR
The Klaaw'vor or Leuian Match of Honor is an ancient Leuian tradition, which is used to 
settle disputes and matters of honor, and as, such is governed by a strict set of practices.

The Match is  between two combatants only.  Each may have a Second or witness,  but 
Seconds are not required, nor may Seconds participate in any way.  The Klaaw'vor is  
used to redress insults to the honor of a Leuian, or to settle a legitimate disputes. It is not 
a tool of vengeance nor a method of punishment.  It is done in the presence of other 
Leuians, but is not to be made a public spectacle or done in the presence of non-Leuians. 
The Klaaw'vor is usually fought with claws and the use of runemagick is frowned upon.

The match is fought until a participant is killed or submits. A combatant is considered to 
have submitted if any of the following are performed by or on behalf of the combatant:
Any attempt to treat or heal a wound.
Any attempt to retreat or run.

The Klaaw'vor is initiated by the challenge.  The challenger, in the presence of the 
defender, declares the matter to be redressed, and to be settled by the Rite of Klaaw'vor, 
traditionally with the words "I have been wronged. I have come to claim the Rite of 
Klaaw'vor. Defend yourself."  The defender may either redress the challenger and make 
amends or accept the Klaaw'vor, and the matter will be scheduled for a match. If the 
defender refuses to redress the challenger's complaint  or refuses to defend themselves, the 
challenger is considered vindicated. This is considered to be just in Leuian society, for if 
someone refuses to defend their honor when it is questioned then they are considered to 
be a coward and in the wrong on any issue or matter.  

THE SCARED BELIEF OF KIT'GIA
The scared belief in Leuian culture that from our youth comes forth all that is to be 
cherished. Leuian's fiercely believe in the protection and care of their young, who are 
referred to as "Kits." Their love for their kits or Kit'gia is legendary, and their wrath upon 
those who would harm Leuian young is unmerciful.

THE RITE OF ELAN'TAH
The  Leuian belief in the right of personal ownership. Although Leuians have an immense 
sense of group and fellowship, their is only one thing that is considered to be owned by 
all, that being the place of Pride gatherings. Aside from that each Leuian's own personal 
dwellings, items and accouterments are considered theirs alone.

THE HONOR OF KIT'MAR
The right given to motherkynd to name their kits.

Only a mother is allowed to name her child in Leuian culture. The rite is given in honor 
for her labors of bringing the kit into life. 

THE TRADITION OF KHAT'VADA
The Leuian custom of absolute secrecy to that which is most sacred, "the home and 
gathering places of our people." 

Leuian's deeply cherish the Isle from which they come
and shroud its actual location in absolute secrecy. Even Tarr'khats will not break this 
custom. Furthermore, the location of any gathering places, such as the legendary Pride 
Hall receives the same treatment.

THE CUSTOM OF KHA'TIA
The Leuian custom of spiritual and mental bonding between Khat'saras.

 When two Leuians become Khat'saras and lifemate, an incredibly powerful bond is 
created which, as legend states, transcends normal communication and becomes almost 
telepathic in nature. The Leuian tail is the most sensitive part of a Leuian's body and when 
two Leuians lifemate, it is all too common to see the couple walking, sleeping and even 
eating with their tails entwined. This act is referred to as the "Kha'tia" or interweaving of 
souls whereby entwining their tails, a close mental, emotional and spiritual link is 
established which allows for closeness of mind and refreshment of the soul. Little else is 
said regarding this mystical custom or of its benefits to the Leuian warrior, and it is never 
discussed openly.

THE CUSTOM OF SHAN'FARR
The occurrence in Leuian culture of a Leuian dying of sorrow when their Khat'sara dies.

Since the bond between two Khat'saras is so strong, it is a common occurrence for a 
Leuian to die simply of grief or sorrow when the one they are bonded to dies. This is not 
to be confused with suicide, rather it is simply the will to live leaving a Leuian upon the 
news that their Khat'sara has died. Some Leuians are able to carry on with their life after 
such news, but some cannot and for them only Shan'farr , the sorrowful death awaits.

THE SECOND COMING OF THE 
                   LEUIAN PRIDE 
______________________________________________________

PREAMBLE 
The Leuian Pride is the political and cultural center of Leuian society as well 
as serving as clan and kindred to all honorable Leuians. The ranks of the 
Pride are filled by every willing Leuian in the lands, who defend the Pride 
as fiercely as they defend their own lives. It is governed by a council of 
senior Leuians, know as "The Leuian High Council" and is led by a Council 
leader called the "Khatyr." The Pride meets in the legendary Pride hall who's 
actual location is shrouded in secrecy and is considered consecrated ground 
to all Leuians. The Pride is charged with overseeing the welfare of its 
members as well as the safe guarding Leuian traditions and customs. 

THE RITE OF KIT'RA
Any Malekynd or Femalekynd of Leuian birth, processing any level of skill, 
serving any god and performing any profession may join their kindred in 
the Leuian Pride, aside from those Leuian's, who uphold the vocation of 
thief or those Leuians who prostrate themselves before the feet of the 
"nameless one".

There are two time honored paths for admittance into the Pride. First the 
prospective member requests that he or she be introduced to the Pride by 
a sitting member of the Pride or the prospective member is invited to join 
the Pride by a sitting member of the Pride. By either means, the 
prospective member then attends a Pride gathering, takes the Rite of Kit'ra 
and is welcomed into the Pride as one of its kin.

Before a Leuian Warrior can join his or her kin in the Pride, they must take 
the sacred Rite of Kit'ra. This rite signifies the passage from youth to 
adulthood and Pride membership. On this day the warrior is reborn, he or 
she is no longer a Kit or someone of age but as yet without a voice among 
their Kin. Upon receipt of the Rite of Kit'ra they are given a voice within the 
society and  has earned the right to fight along side their High Council and 
people. It is a ancient tradition and great honor for the Leuian being 
inducted into the Pride.

EXAMPLE OF THE KIT'RA
The ceremony is carried out by the Kityuri and Khatyr before a 
congregation of the Pride. The prospective member is referred to as the 
Rhasa'ta'kit'ra until the oath is taken. The ceremony is often followed by 
applause and celebration.

First Kityuri:  "Rhasa'ta'kit'ra, step forth."

The Kit'ra advances X spaces.

First Kityuri: "Leshia'tkra, Spirits of our forefathers and honored dead, I call 
upon you to witness the Rhasa'ta'kit'ra."

Khatyr:  "Kit'leth, Lor'cha, Kit'ra."

Khatyr:  "In the beginning, the Khatkynd was chosen above all others  by 
the gods to be something more than a beast, and as a reward for the 
gratitude our ancestors displayed we were given several things with which 
to live in the name of honor:  our minds with which to recognize honor, 
our claws with which to fight for our honor, our hearts with which to 
cherish the honor, our souls with which to bear our honor.

Khatyr:  "As it was in the beginning, so shall it now be.  Let the Spirit of the 
Pride be infused with new generations of proud warriors, whether you 
defend your honor with claw, sword, our rune, the voice, or the heart.  
Stand strong.  Stand proud.  Rhasa'ta'kit'ra, this I demand of you, to the 
Pride bring honor, breath honor, live honor, never shame or disgrace our 
honor."

Khatyr:  "Kitleth, Lor'cha, Kit'ra."

Khatyr to Kit'ra: "Will you (Kit'ras name) embrace the honor, loyalty, and 
the courage of the Pride?"

Kit'ra:  "With heart, mind, soul, and body, I do embrace.
This I swear on this day."

Khatyr:  "Then this we swear to you: to reward your devotion with love, 
your honor with recognition, and your oathbreaking with vengeance."  

Khatyr: "Kit'leth, Lor'cha. Kit'ra the circle is complete, the Kit'ra has been 
fulfilled take your place among the honored warriors of the Pride and 
never disgrace what was done on this day."

THE SACRED PRECEPTS OF THE LEUIAN PRIDE
The Pride is governed by a set of ancient and sacred laws which have their 
roots in Leuian custom and tradition and have been handed down from 
generation to generation. The laws which are referred to as the "Sacred 
Precepts" are to be followed by each and every Pride member without 
question or debate. 

THE FIRST PRECEPT
The Precept of Freedom " Leuians Must Remain a Free People"

The Pride shall challenge, with raised voice or sharpened claw any attempt 
to enslave, harm, or destroy Khatkynd.  

Sub-Precepts:
A. When efforts are afoot to harm or destroy Khatkynd all, Pride members    
are expected to defend the Leuian race to the best of their ability under the 
direction of the Leuian High Council.
B. If diplomatic protest is required to defeat an attempt to harm Khatkynd, 
it shall be furnished by the Khatyr and/or the seat of First Sonchi.
C. If selective military action is needed to remain a free people it shall be 
furnished by the Klaawmara under the direction of the First Kang and 
Leuian High Council.

THE SECOND PRECEPT
The Precept of Honor "Deal With The Pride and One Another in Honor 
and Truth."

Every Pride member is expected to treat with their fellow Pride members in 
honor and truth and to never bring dishonor to the Pride as a whole.

Sub-Precepts:
A. Under no circumstances is a sitting Pride member to thieve, pilfer or 
swindle anyone. To follow the ways of the Tarr'khats is considered a most 
dishonorable act and if such an act is witnessed it should be reported to the 
seat of first Kemtah for investigation.

B. Under no circumstances is a sitting Pride member to unjustly spill 
innocent blood. To kill a fellow Leuian, or member of any race without 
honorable combat is considered a most dishonorable act. If such an act is 
witnessed it should be reported to the seat of first Kemtah for investigation.

C. Under no circumstances is a sitting Pride member to betray the Pride, 
including but not limited to reveling Pride Secrets to non members, reveling 
the location of Pride hall to non members, etc. etc. If such an act is 
witnessed, it should be reported to the seat of first Kemtah for 
investigation.


THE THIRD PRECEPT 
The Precept of Tarr'khat, "Let those who worship dishonor be cast forth 
from our midst."

Under no circumstances is a Tarr'khat to be allowed the honor of Pride 
Membership.

THE FORTH PRECEPT
The Precept of Sovereignty, "The Blood of the Pride shall remain Leuian."

Under no circumstances is someone not of Leuian kin to be admitted as a 
member, however, those of other races who bring honor to the Pride or 
are the Khat'sara of a sitting Pride member shall receive reward, honor, 
respect and special dispensation(see Orders Bestowed) from the Pride.

Sentencing Guidelines
Honor demands no unjust punishments, therefore when a Leuian 
transgresses upon the scared precepts he or she shall receive a full 
investigation of the matter, an evenhanded hearing on the matter. If 
discipline is deemed necessary, a just and fair punishment shall be leveled 
against them.

There are two types of discipline the Pride shall inflict upon those who 
dishonor it. The first is a warning, if the crime is of a light nature and due in 
part to inexperience and youth, a warning shall be given to the Leuian in 
question by the Khatyr and First Kemtah. This warning shall be given before 
the multitude of the Pride so as to shame the Leuian in question. The 
second discipline, which is referred to as "Ker'nath" is applied to the most 
egregious infractions on Leuian law.

The Ker'nath 
The Leuian in question is excommunicated from the Pride and all Leuian 
culture, he or she is dubbed a Tarr'khat. The Ker'nath is carried out in ritual 
fashion were by the Leuian in question is brought before the Khatyr and 
High Council. The High Council forms a circle round the Leuian in question.

The Khatyr speaks the words: Ker'nath Khatkynd Ka'mar Khat'laki, which 
means "we your people, know you no more, you heart is no longer Leuian, 
therefore I strip what little honor you have left from you, you are banished 
from your kin"

Each member of the high council then slowly folds their arms across their 
chest and turns their back to the Leuian in question, as a sign that his or her 
people will no longer accept them as one of their own.

The Leuian in question is escorted away from council chambers, never again 
to live as a honorable Leuian in the eyes of his or her people. 

THE VENERATED LEUIAN HIGH COUNCIL
The Leuian High Council is responsible for all matters dealing with the Pride. They act as 
government, elders, mentors and benefactors to all Leuians. They are shinning examples 
of what is best in Leuian culture and as such they are to treated with respect and honor. It 
should never be assumed that they are overbearing or unapproachable as it is their charge 
to work with the members of the Pride to undertake the sacred mission of the Pride.

THE KHATYR
The Khatyr is the leader of Leuian High Council and the spokesperson of the entire Pride. 
It is said that when the first Pride was organized on Leuia, it was seen fit to have one 
person lead the Pride, as there are times when the voice of many must be represented by 
one. The Khatyr serves this purpose, he or she speaks for the Pride and represents all that 
is best in Leuian culture.

Although the Khatyr is the leader of the Pride his or her actual power however is 
beholden to the Pride as a whole. He or she cannot act without the consent of the whole 
Pride, he or she does not make key decisions on behalf of the Pride without the consent 
of all. Only in rare circumstances is the Khatyr allowed to invoke executive powers and 
make key decisions that will affect all. Such circumstances usually include a matter were 
time is of the essence and the entire Pride cannot be called for a vote. Even in these 
circumstances, the Khatyr must consult as many members of the High Council can be 
found before acting. 
The Khatyr must also keep all matters before the Pride in absolute openness. Within 
Leuian Prides there are no secrets and nothing is for the Khatyr's ears only. 

THE LEUIAN HIGH COUNCIL
The Leuian High Council forms the governing body of the Pride. They are lead by the 
Khatyr as a whole but each seat on the council has its special duty, that is performed on 
behalf of the Pride. Like the Khatyr the are expected to be approachable and helpful to all 
Leuians as well as shinning examples of the best in Leuian culture.

to defeat the enemies of the Pride. When such an event occurs it is the duty 
of the Klaaw'mara to accomplish. The Klaaw'mara is a strike team consisting 
of the best warriors of the Pride specially trained to engage the enemies of 
the Pride in honorable combat. It is not a gang or execution squad and it 
never acts without the express consent of the entire Pride.

THE SACRED GATHERINGS
The Leuian Pride meets every seventh day to discuss matters of interest to 
the Leuian race. These gatherings consist of ceremonies(Kit'ras, bestowing 
orders etc.), celebrations(announcements of Khat'sara), training(Klaawfests),
debates(wars and treaties) and all matter of things Leuians discuss between 
themselves. The gatherings are considered the one time a Leuian can truly 
be a Leuian, he or she is amongst kin, and for many it is an occasion of 
great joy. The gatherings are often followed by tales of heroic deeds, song, 
drink, hunts, celebration and sometimes warrior brawls or tests of strength 
long into night, regardless of whatever issues were discussed at the 
gathering. Simply put, a Leuian among a hundred other Leuians is a blissful 
Leuian. In the hall of warriors among his or her honored brothers and 
sisters, the Leuian is at home.

THE KLAAWFESTS
Klaawfests, as the name suggests, reefer to a group of Leuian warriors 
clawing to death something on a grand hunt. Klaawfests are called for many 
reasons. The first Majtai, Khatleth, Kahlor, Karu and Khatshire often call for 
Klaawfests in order to train those unskilled in the arts they represent. 
Klaawfests may also be called by the first Durah in order to raise treasure to 
fill the Pride's coffers. Finally Klaawfests can be called simply for the 
enjoyment of Leuian only hunts. Although the sheer sight of large numbers 
of Leuian warriors, drunk with songs of honor and shouting war cries into 
the quiet of the night while clawing their prey to death is a terrifying sight, 
to Leuians it is the height of enjoyment.

HONORED ORDERS  BESTOWED
There are times when the Pride wishes to honor those among its ranks who 
have distinguished themselves before their kin or who have brought great 
honor to the Pride as a whole. There are also times when members of other 
races have befriended the Leuian race and have earned the right to be 
officially recognized by the Pride. When such times occur, honorable orders 
are bestowed upon these persons. The orders bring great personal honor 
and prestige to the ones they are bestowed upon as well as honor to their 
kin. Each order is accompanied by a token of honor, procured from the 
peddlers.

material generosity to there fellow kinsmen.

Order of the Cohort of the Pride, The Venerable Claw or "Honored one among us":
Bestowed upon anyone of another race who's generosity, endorsement, guidance and 
devotion for and to the Pride and Leuian race has earned him or her the right to be called 
"Honored one among us." This is an order and title of great respect among Leuians.

Order of the Pridemate:
Bestowed upon those of other races who through the ritual of Khat'sara have asked to 
become part of their lifemate's Pride. Only those who have renounced all ways, customs 
and traditions but for those of the Leuians and the Leuian Pride will be accepted. If their 
renunciation is satisfactory, the lifemate will be accepted into the Pride as a member of its 
own, however with limited membership, there are some things that only Leuians should 
be party to, but the Pridemate shall receive the Prides protection, generosity and 
friendship and be included in many Pride events. Due to the severity of the renunciation 
an order of respect is bestowed to those who faithfully execute the spirit of the 
renunciation. They are for ever know as "Pridemates" or, "those honored few who 
through the ritual of Khat'sara, and renunciation of the own races ways have become  
honored members of our people."

CONTEMPORARY PRIDE HISTORY
Very little is known about the period of Leuian Pride history leading up to present day. 
What is known is that two hundred years ago, the Leuian Pride suffered many 
misfortunes. Leuian tradition and custom became second place to the customs and 
traditions of the Spur. Leuians far from home, are said to have forgotten much of what 
made the Leuian race so feared and so respected, and little if anything was done to 
correct the matter. Normally envoy after envoy would have been dispatched from Leuia 
to correct and repair the damage done, but none of any note ever came. 

This is believed to be due in part to the recent news which has come forth regarding a 
crisis which had taken hold on Leuia. Rumors of an uprising and a long Leuian civil war 
have surfaced. Whatever the reason, a wave of senior Leuians have been arriving on the 
shores of the Spur, tightlipped about the past situation on the home island,
but crusading for a new Pride which honors Leuian tradition and custom, and a return to 
the old ways, which crafted the race that even the gods themselves referred to as "that 
most fearsome honor-bound warrior race."
