[The Great Room.]

An enormous circle of smooth oak columns create the walls of the Great Room. From the door, the hard-packed floor descends to a blazing fire pit with aromatic woods such as apple wood, orange and juniper. Fragrant braided sweet-grass mats are placed randomly around the fire pit. Horn sconces bearing beeswax candles emit a soft light, which permeates the room. A simple, yet elegant redwood plaque adorns the far wall. Carved into this plaque is a dedication. A golden flag is prominently displayed against one wall. Mounted above the grand oak door is a leather banner that has "Walk in Honor" branded into it. A Saldaean crafted, walnut weapons case stands in the corner of the room. Various Leuian symbols are hammered into the moonsilver panels adorning the case's doors. A highly polished, maple pantry sits next to the weapons case and bears the mark of the Leuian warrior on each of it's doors.  An east corridor, a west corridor, a golden flag, a redwood plaque, an open leather door, a closed grand oak door, an open Saldean crafted walnut weapons case, an open Leuian crafted oak trunk, an open polished maple pantry, a small cup of blue fizz, a tasty piece of blueberry pie, a glass of bubbly citrus spritzer, and a tasty piece of blueberry pie are here.

Quietly, a yellow and black bumble bee flies around a small garden of fragrant violet orchids while a small bird eats some seed from a bird feeder hung on the walls of the fort. It is startled by approaching footsteps and flies off towards the northeast. A cool breeze carries the sweet scent of flowers, as the sound of distant fresh running water mumbles the whispered conversations of townspeople.  A closed maple door, a cozy cottage, a closed oak cottage door, a Pride Hall, and an exotic violet orchid box are here.

[Meetpoint Square.]

Within the heart of this proud fort one can see all around that the reconstruction of its buildings has begun. Large stones and logs have been stacked and piled, while some workers tirelessly attempt to repair the damage that occurred here during the Lords of Chaos wars. The buildings and homes of the people that resided here are slowly taking shape, though, far from completed. The smell of dyes, used to paint the town, permeate the area.  A breathtaking shimmering bouquet of moonflowers, an open light blue door, and a glowing wrought iron street lantern are here.

Two guards patrol above the gate, looking you over carefully before giving leave to pass through the heavy wood gate. Thick and long wooden ladders serve up to the guard's posts high in the sky so that they may have some relief from their duties overlooking the land and city. Through the slates of the wooden walkways, you can make out four archers playing a game of cards, weapons at the ready. A whip cracks loudly as a caravan heads out the gate towards Spur.  A glowing wrought iron lantern is here.

Rising up out of the plains, a large walled fort receives the end of the stone road. The river flows from either side, running through the fort from this angle of view. The vegetation surrounding the tradeway at this point has been burned out recently, allowing a clear field of vision from the tops of the walls ahead. The stones show little wear from the heavy traffic of feet and wheels alike; it has certainly been well constructed.

The grass rises taller and taller in every direction further limiting view just off the roadside. A second glance reveals that this is the lowest point in a large, shallow depression. The tradeway sinks a little lower as it gets closer to the river off to the west. A ditch runs alongside the river's side of the road, small puddles of water filling the bottom. Trickles filter into the puddles from the grass beyond as mosquitoes dart across the muddy surfaces.

Only the well-built, stone tradeway gives any hint of civilization ever having had any presence here. The tall grasses limit visibility nearby, hiding any wildlife that may be waiting for prey to stumble too close. A few blades of grass sway slightly in the breeze, some of them broken by the passing of something heavy over them. One of the larger stones in the road, broken loose from its mortar, waits patiently to be repaired.

The stone paved tradeway stretches across the open plains, interrupting nature's task of consuming the land. An endless sea of grass surrounds you, lapping at the road much like the tides against a beach. The faintly damp wind occasionally blowing in from the west smells of earth. Some of the stones in the road interlock together to form the crude image of a lion. There is no discerning if it was done on purpose or sheer accident.

The tradeway runs across the open grasslands northeast towards the Spur, and southwest towards distant lands and eventually, the coast. The plains to the south and east seem totally indifferent to your existence. Just ahead, a small path moves up a village of huts spread out in a semi-circle. In the center of the village a giant fire pit sits where barbarians who wander through the village can sit around to stay warm.  A worn grassy path is here.

Set within a wide tunnel leading through the hedge to the north is the Wilderness Gate. It separates the settled lands of Spur from the open plains to the south of the city. The plains stretch as far as the eyes can see, the horizon and the walls of the fort down the road the only blemishes of the grassy landscape in the distance. The stones of the road are smoothly set together, well built to withstand heavy travel. A broken wagon wheel, discarded some time ago, covers a spot of nearby grass, weeds trying to climb through the spokes.

A trio of Leuian sailors stumble past, returning to the docks. The youngest in the group is being helped along, an arm over each of his partner's shoulders. He mutters something about swabbing decks for the rest of his career. Hearty laughter from the two veterans carries on until the three are out of earshot.

An acrid stench assails your nose before the source becomes apparent. Something quite large, but definitely dead and half-eaten, lies between two large ravens. Squawking noisily, they compete over the carrion. Muffled growls emanate from the tree-line, and a sudden rustling causes the birds to take flight, leaving their prize behind. Were those golden eyes flashing in the shadows?

Travelers from Rathan to the northwest, and the Trade Route to the south, converge at Spur's west gate. Guards posted on the ground give those seeking to enter the city a cursory once-over. Their lack of interest shows that anyone approaching has already been observed from above for some time. A grate in the ground loosens mud from wagon wheels and hooves before they pass through the gate, helping to keep the streets of Spur fairly clean.  An open giant black iron gate, a giant green oak tree, a small blue pool, a thick oak grate over the pool, and a polished stone marker are here.

The path has been grown over by tall grass and brambles making it seem that no one has travelled this route in quite a while.  To the northeast, the trail works its way out of the canyon and joins the main pass within the mountains.  To the south the rolling hills descend slowly into a wide valley.  A narrow path is here.

Flowering vines and bushes crowd onto the trail, threatening to take it over completely.  Still, it's remarkable that the trail is as well defined as it is, since the valley has been unused for eons.  Perhaps there is more to the valley than meets the eye.

Tall oak trees line the slope, blocking any view of the mountains that tower above. Colorful birds flitter from tree to tree calling to each other in a beautiful kaleidoscope of color and sound.

You're standing at a crossing of quite a few white stoned roads that encircle the valley. Almost desolate in terrain, few small bushes scatter the area, pushing their way up from between the stones. Beyond the roads lie rolling fields of green.  An open worn cloth pouch, an open pretty lionskin bag, and a wooden sword are here.

[Valley of Ruins, Road.]

This stretch of road is quite unsettling.  You're not sure which bothers you more:  the shadowy presence that you sense to the north, or the eerie force that seems to be calling to the east.  Perhaps these ruins are not so deserted as they once seemed.  A platinum cutlass, a platinum cutlass, a two-handed bronze pike, a platinum cutlass, an old leather saddle, a bronze bastard sword, a bronze battle-axe, a platinum cutlass, a two-handed bronze pike, a two-handed bronze pike, a short black talon, a two-handed bronze pike, a two-handed bronze pike, and a closed leather bound cookbook are here.

This area is not illuminated.
You see the 1st dark revenant corpse, the 2nd dark revenant corpse, the 1st gargoyle corpse, the 1st dark rider, the 1st skeletal knight, and the 2nd gargoyle.
In the area are Audun the Noble Leuian, Hott the Noble Leuian, Aviendha the Leuian, Netraa the Noble Leuian, Tchori the Leuian, Yinnin the Noble Leuian, Lorkhit the Leuian, Shaleu the Noble Leuian, Tiruna the Noble Leuian, Tau the Leuian, and Meir the Noble Leuian.

It is hard to be certain what was once here.  Weeds spring up easily between the stones of the floor, and ivy has overtaken the walls.  The plant life seems strangely in place, though.  Perhaps this was once a meditative garden, now gone awry.  Some gold coins, some silver coins, a smooth glass marble, a dead grey mouse, and some silver coins are here.

Flowering vines and bushes crowd onto the trail, threatening to take it over completely.  Still, it's remarkable that the trail is as well defined as it is, since the valley has been unused for eons.  Perhaps there is more to the valley than meets the eye. An overgrown and crumbling tiled marble road leads south into the heart of the ancient city's ruins.

Old trees lay side by side with the massive boulders of the mountain, intermingling in a terrible landslide. The mountain top has broken off and slid across the eastern road stopping all forms of transportation. It would take years for mortal hands to remove the tons of stone from the original roadway to make it passable once again. Thankfully, nature has changed the landscape for the better, and has opened a gap through the mountain to the north.

Old trees lay side by side with the massive boulders of the mountain, intermingling in a terrible landslide. The mountain top has broken off and slid across the eastern road stopping all forms of transportation. It would take years for mortal hands to remove the tons of stone from the original roadway to make it passable once again. Thankfully, nature has changed the landscape for the better, and has opened a gap through the mountain to the north.

To the southwest the ghostly outline of a forest can be seen darkening the area around it like a blight upon the land. Grassy plains stretch out to the west. Swarms of tiny insects hover just above the grass, in some places the swarms are so dense they take on the appearance of being a single entity.

The path is flanked by countless tall oaks, swaying peacefully in the wind. They do their best to hide the sky from view, making it hard to tell night from day at times.

The remnants of a violent fight lie all around you, whomever used to belong to the wagon is no more than vulture food.  A bloody severed foot is here.

Oak trees surround you on every side reaching their leaves up to the sky in majestic splendor. Rising high above the rest of the oaks stands a massive tree, clearly hundreds of years older than those around it within this section of the forest. A small path curves around the base of the tree and enters what looks to be some sort of small clearing, you can see a few Elves dressed entirely in green walking within the clearing, though telling them from the forest is proving a difficult task. A small sign hangs above the path that reads, "Foresters Guild".  A giant green oak tree, a golden oak tree, a giant ancient oak tree, and a worn grassy path are here.

Travelers from Rathan to the northwest, and the Trade Route to the south, converge at Spur's west gate. Guards posted on the ground give those seeking to enter the city a cursory once-over. Their lack of interest shows that anyone approaching has already been observed from above for some time. A grate in the ground loosens mud from wagon wheels and hooves before they pass through the gate, helping to keep the streets of Spur fairly clean.  An open giant black iron gate, a giant green oak tree, a small blue pool, a thick oak grate over the pool, and a polished stone marker are here.

An acrid stench assails your nose before the source becomes apparent. Something quite large, but definitely dead and half-eaten, lies between two large ravens. Squawking noisily, they compete over the carrion. Muffled growls emanate from the tree-line, and a sudden rustling causes the birds to take flight, leaving their prize behind. Were those golden eyes flashing in the shadows?

An ork scrambles across the road just ahead of you, squeaking in panic. Arrows from above strike the ground at the creature's heels. The shrieking beast reaches the edge of the tree line and ducks easily under the lower branches of an old Beech. Before disappearing into the forest, it releases a final snort. With a wave and a nod, a Firian guard on the city wall indicates the way is clear.

The plains stretch as far as the eyes can see, the horizon and the walls of the fort down the road the only blemishes of the grassy landscape in the distance. The stones of the road are smoothly set together, well built to withstand heavy travel. A broken wagon wheel, discarded some time ago, covers a spot of nearby grass, weeds trying to climb through the spokes.

The tradeway runs across the open grasslands northeast towards the Spur, and southwest towards distant lands and eventually, the coast. The plains to the south and east seem totally indifferent to your existence. Just ahead, a small path moves up a village of huts spread out in a semi-circle. In the center of the village a giant fire pit sits where barbarians who wander through the village can sit around to stay warm.  A worn grassy path is here.

The stone paved tradeway stretches across the open plains, interrupting nature's task of consuming the land. An endless sea of grass surrounds you, lapping at the road much like the tides against a beach. The faintly damp wind occasionally blowing in from the west smells of earth.

Only the well-built, stone tradeway gives any hint of civilization ever having had any presence here. The tall grasses limit visibility nearby, hiding any wildlife that may be waiting for prey to stumble too close. A few blades of grass sway slightly in the breeze, some of them broken by the passing of something heavy over them. One of the larger stones in the road, broken loose from its mortar, waits patiently to be repaired.

The grass rises taller and taller in every direction further limiting view just off the roadside. A second glance reveals that this is the lowest point in a large, shallow depression. The tradeway sinks a little lower as it gets closer to the river off to the west. A ditch runs alongside the river's side of the road, small puddles of water filling the bottom. Trickles filter into the puddles from the grass beyond as mosquitoes dart across the muddy surfaces.

Rising up out of the plains, a large walled fort receives the end of the stone road. The river flows from either side, running through the fort from this angle of view. The vegetation surrounding the tradeway at this point has been burned out recently, allowing a clear field of vision from the tops of the walls ahead. The stones show little wear from the heavy traffic of feet and wheels alike; it has certainly been well constructed.

[Meetpoint gate.]

Standing before you lies the dilapidated remains of a once proud fort. Erected up for many feet one can see the silhouette of a stocky figure far above in what appears to resemble a Guard's Post. Attentive and composed many guards protect this outer wall with their blades and bows.

You follow Tiruna through an open wooden gate...

[Meetpoint.]

Two guards patrol above the gate, looking you over carefully before giving leave to pass through the heavy wood gate. Thick and long wooden ladders serve up to the guard's posts high in the sky so that they may have some relief from their duties overlooking the land and city. Through the slates of the wooden walkways, you can make out four archers playing a game of cards, weapons at the ready. A whip cracks loudly as a caravan heads out the gate towards Spur.  A glowing wrought iron lantern is here.

Meir reaches out and tenderly joins hands with Tiruna.

Aviendha grins.

Audun purrs softly.

Tiruna nuzzles Meir.

Meir purrs.

Aviendha smiles at Meir.

Lorkhit stretches.

Audun asks Tiruna in Leuian, "So how much did we make for the pride tonight?"

You follow Tiruna southwest...

[Meetpoint Square.]

Within the heart of this proud fort one can see all around that the reconstruction of its buildings has begun. Large stones and logs have been stacked and piled, while some workers tirelessly attempt to repair the damage that occurred here during the Lords of Chaos wars. The buildings and homes of the people that resided here are slowly taking shape, though, far from completed. The smell of dyes, used to paint the town, permeate the area.  A breathtaking shimmering bouquet of moonflowers, an open light blue door, and a glowing wrought iron street lantern are here.

[Meetpoint Bank.]

Off to the north one can make out the familiar sound of money. The clanking of coins can be heard distinctly. One of the only buildings that happened to survive in this fort from the days of lore, the bank. A small man can be seen traveling to and from the sidewalk to the very spot you are at with his hand held out and a look of sorrow in his eyes. His demeanor and countenance denotes that he might have once been a dignitary of the fort, but like the fort he and it strive to come back from the shambles.  An open rough wooden door and a wooden sign are here.

In the room are Audun the Noble Leuian, Aviendha the Leuian, Tchori the Leuian, Lorkhit the Leuian, Shaleu the Noble Leuian, Tiruna the Noble Leuian, Tau the Leuian, and Meir the Noble Leuian.

Audun smiles lightly.

Meir smiles at Aviendha.

You follow Tiruna through an open rough wooden door...

[Meetpoint Bank.]

Behind the counter, busily working away, an old Fir Elf is taking the deposits of the travelers passing through. At another counter a young Usil Elf gives the withdraws to the merchants and passersby. The floor is covered with a bluish-green carpeting that appears quite expensive and hardly scathed by the feet of wanderers. A reddish-brown couch adorned with the furs of many exotic beasts sits in the corner with great appeal to the weary.  An open rough wooden door and a bright wooden sign are here.

[Meetpoint Inn.]

Quaint and small this inn offers hospitality for various weary travelers. Coloring the vaulted ceiling is a mural of a red sky with a bright orange sun hidden behind delicate white clouds. Centering the back wall rests a king-sized sleigh bed with an ivory colored comforter draped across and fluffy inviting pillows placed on top. Along both sides of the bed are deep cherry nightstands. One with a pitcher of water and wash basin on top and the other a scented candle upon a wrought iron plate. Pushed against the eastern wall is a large cherry armoire.  A cherry nightstand, a king size bed, a cherry nightstand, an open cherry armoire, and an open light blue door are here.
