The clump of trees to the north seems very thick, but that shouldn't have stopped determined builders. As you puzzle over the matter, you think you hear something calling you. You shake your head and move on.

This well-worn road separates the Bazaar to the north and Market Circle to the south. Only a Thugian could appreciate the layered odors of simmering foodstuffs and shoppers from the Bazaar. Crowds of people push past, some brushing against you. It might be a good idea to keep an eye on your coinpurse.  A street lantern is here.

Obvious paths: east* west*.
[Trade & Bazaar.]

A path to the north winds its way among various stalls and tents. Some specialty outlets can be found, provided one does not get lost in this maze known as the Bazaar. More permanent structures to the south suggest finer goods as well as increased security.  A street lantern is here.

Many townsfolk pass along this busy thoroughfare. Rich and poor alike mix freely on this street, much to the dismay of a passing nobleman. A young human struggles with an armful of packages and two young children in tow. Those in need of goods or supplies head west towards the market, those looking for the news of the day head east towards Town Square.  A street lantern is here.

The buildings of Market Circle stand to the south. It becomes obvious that the area through the arch is a much cleaner marketplace than the bazaar. An inviting eatery stands beside the road, its door open to those weary after a long trip to Spur, as well as those preparing to venture to the great expanses beyond the west gate. A human couple exit the building, arm in arm. A small sign stands beside the intersection.  A sign, an open glossy lacquered oak door, and a street lantern are here.

An arch between two large buildings connects Market Circle and Market Street. The more reputable shopkeepers do business within the circle, but pay higher taxes for the privilege. The buildings have been built to last, as these merchants are no traveling tinkers. Interlocking stone walkways and colorful plantings span this central area. Despite the number of animals waiting outside the bank for their owners, the area is spotless. Loud chatter in many languages can be heard from the southwest.  A marble archway, an open elegant gold-trimmed walnut door, and a wooden sign are here.

By torchlight or daylight, the windows of this shop sparkle from the many faceted stones inside. The sight almost makes one forget the presence of two Thugian guards and their war dogs guarding the entrance. The etched window glass indicates this is Fredriquede Tiffany's place of business, widely regarded as the finest jeweler in the land.  An engraved marble plaque and an open banded steelwood door are here.

>[Market Circle.]

An arch between two large buildings connects Market Circle and Market Street. The more reputable shopkeepers do business within the circle, but pay higher taxes for the privilege. The buildings have been built to last, as these merchants are no traveling tinkers. Interlocking stone walkways and colorful plantings span this central area. Despite the number of animals waiting outside the bank for their owners, the area is spotless. Loud chatter in many languages can be heard from the southwest.  A marble archway, an open elegant gold-trimmed walnut door, and a wooden sign are here.

Market Street ends here at a large archway. People bustle in and out of the arch, some without so much as a nod. The city wall rises up to the south and west of the buildings of Market Circle. A small sign is posted on the wall beside the archway.  A street lantern is here.

Situated between the well-traveled Trade Way to the north and the fine shops of Market Circle to the south, this small stretch of road is busy at all times of day. Adventurers with sacks of plundered goods leave Market Street and head west. A shrewd businessman has set up shop in this busy area of the Market District.  A street lantern is here.

The buildings of Market Circle stand to the south. It becomes obvious that the area through the arch is a much cleaner marketplace than the bazaar. An inviting eatery stands beside the road, its door open to those weary after a long trip to Spur, as well as those preparing to venture to the great expanses beyond the west gate. A human couple exit the building, arm in arm. A small sign stands beside the intersection.  A sign, an open glossy lacquered oak door, and a street lantern are here.

A path to the north winds its way among various stalls and tents. Some specialty outlets can be found, provided one does not get lost in this maze known as the Bazaar.

Many townsfolk pass along this busy thoroughfare. Rich and poor alike mix freely on this street, much to the dismay of a passing nobleman.

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.   A flowing white marble fountain, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a cracked marble statue of a Human, a carved marble statue of a Dragon, a rosewood sign, some ruby ashes, and a deep fluffy snow drift are here.

A small sign hangs from above the door of the well-kept store before you, telling you that it is a rune shop. The occasional bright flash of light from inside the store suggests all kinds of strange and rare magicks are being cast inside! Those who walk past you glance at the rune shop warily and hurry to get past it as quickly as possible. A small sign hangs from the doorknob of the store that reads "Flerians not allowed!"  An intricately carved oak door and a street lantern are here.

A small garden of strange plants and spices grows before a small store. The aromas from the objects planted within the garden are intoxicating; they tug at your senses in a confusing attack of reactions. You feel as if you want to sneeze, cough, breathe in and breathe out all at the same time. A stone path cuts through the center of the garden leading to the front door of the shop.  A small wooden door and a street lantern are here.

Dried, cooked, boiled and washed, different herbs sit in boxes upon the counter with prices and information telling of what magical quality the herb or leaf possesses. The smells from the plants of the herbalist seem to have seeped into the walls and ceiling of the small store, everything in the store smells of spice. How anyone could bear to stay in this shop and not have their allergies drive them slowly insane, you can only wonder.  A weathered wooden sign and a small wooden door are here.
