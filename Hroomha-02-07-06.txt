>[Town Square Center.]

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.  A flowing white marble fountain, a marble statue of a Human, a shimmering marble statue of a Dragon, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a rosewood sign, a crisp gold lettered vellum notice, a fluffy white layer of snow, a glistening white snow fort, a pile of sparkling snow balls, a pair of rough grey wool tights, and a dirty glass of beer are here.

This area is illuminated.
You see the 1st tiny grey mouse (wearing a small gold collar).
In the area are Dracaen the Draco (seated), Talishia the Leuian, Nasci the Noble Leuian, Crax the Noble Leuian, Jade the Noble San Elf, Runningdeer the Leuian (lying down), Stormy the Leuian, and Thurrg the Noble Thugian.

Small children, who earn a few silver for their work, watch over the many merchant and traveler's carts that sit in front. Towards the east you can hear the shuffle of footsteps and loud discussions on Spurian lifestyle echo from those who stand outside the Tower's double doors.

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.  A flowing white marble fountain, a marble statue of a Human, a shimmering marble statue of a Dragon, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a rosewood sign, a crisp gold lettered vellum notice, a fluffy white layer of snow, a glistening white snow fort, and a pile of sparkling snow balls are here.
