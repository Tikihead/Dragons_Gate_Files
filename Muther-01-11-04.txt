[The Great Room.]

An enormous circle of smooth oak columns create the walls of the Great Room. From the door, the hard-packed floor descends to a blazing fire pit with aromatic woods such as apple wood, orange and juniper. Fragrant braided sweet-grass mats are placed randomly around the fire pit. Horn sconces bearing beeswax candles emit a soft light, which permeates the room. A simple, yet elegant redwood plaque adorns the far wall. Carved into this plaque is a dedication. A golden flag is prominently displayed against one wall. Mounted above the grand oak door is a leather banner that has "Walk in Honor" branded into it. A Saldaean crafted, walnut weapons case stands in the corner of the room. Various Leuian symbols are hammered into the moonsilver panels adorning the case's doors. A highly polished, maple pantry sits next to the weapons case and bears the mark of the Leuian warrior on each of it's doors.  An east corridor, a west corridor, a golden flag, a redwood plaque, an open leather door, a closed grand oak door, a closed Saldean crafted walnut weapons case, an open Leuian crafted oak trunk, and an open polished maple pantry are here.

[The Great Room.]

An enormous circle of smooth oak columns create the walls of the Great Room. From the door, the hard-packed floor descends to a blazing fire pit with aromatic woods such as apple wood, orange and juniper. Fragrant braided sweet-grass mats are placed randomly around the fire pit. Horn sconces bearing beeswax candles emit a soft light, which permeates the room. A simple, yet elegant redwood plaque adorns the far wall. Carved into this plaque is a dedication. A golden flag is prominently displayed against one wall. Mounted above the grand oak door is a leather banner that has "Walk in Honor" branded into it. A Saldaean crafted, walnut weapons case stands in the corner of the room. Various Leuian symbols are hammered into the moonsilver panels adorning the case's doors. A highly polished, maple pantry sits next to the weapons case and bears the mark of the Leuian warrior on each of it's doors.  An east corridor, a west corridor, a golden flag, a redwood plaque, an open leather door, a closed grand oak door, a closed Saldean crafted walnut weapons case, an open Leuian crafted oak trunk, and an open polished maple pantry are here.

An enormous circle of smooth oak columns create the walls of the Great Room. From the door, the hard-packed floor descends to a blazing fire pit with aromatic woods such as apple wood, orange and juniper. Fragrant braided sweet-grass mats are placed randomly around the fire pit. Horn sconces bearing beeswax candles emit a soft light, which permeates the room. A simple, yet elegant redwood plaque adorns the far wall. Carved into this plaque is a dedication. A golden flag is prominently displayed against one wall. Mounted above the grand oak door is a leather banner that has "Walk in Honor" branded into it. A Saldaean crafted, walnut weapons case stands in the corner of the room. Various Leuian symbols are hammered into the moonsilver panels adorning the case's doors. A highly polished, maple pantry sits next to the weapons case and bears the mark of the Leuian warrior on each of it's doors.  An east corridor, a west corridor, a golden flag, a redwood plaque, an open leather door, a closed grand oak door, an open Saldean crafted walnut weapons case, an open Leuian crafted oak trunk, and an open polished maple pantry are here.

[The Secluded Garden.]

Plush, green grass covers the ground. A small babbling brook rises suddenly from the ground then runs through the clearing flowing over smooth stones creating a miniature waterfall which then drains back into the earth. A large garden with rows of vegetables is surrounded by a radiant flowerbed bursting in a riot of colors. Claw footed oak benches are sporadically placed around the garden and brook. Large trees, as tall as the surrounding building, create a canopy for the clearing allowing small rays of sun, as well as, tiny portals to view the twinkling stars with a stunning view of Rinanni's Circle of Promise. On each side of the garden, almost hidden by the dense foliage of the trees, are two grand deep mahogany tufted leather doors etched with the Pride's symbol.  A babbling brook, an open leather door, an open leather door, a small granite cenotaph, and an open flaming iron food warmer are here.

[The Great Room.]

An enormous circle of smooth oak columns create the walls of the Great Room. From the door, the hard-packed floor descends to a blazing fire pit with aromatic woods such as apple wood, orange and juniper. Fragrant braided sweet-grass mats are placed randomly around the fire pit. Horn sconces bearing beeswax candles emit a soft light, which permeates the room. A simple, yet elegant redwood plaque adorns the far wall. Carved into this plaque is a dedication. A golden flag is prominently displayed against one wall. Mounted above the grand oak door is a leather banner that has "Walk in Honor" branded into it. A Saldaean crafted, walnut weapons case stands in the corner of the room. Various Leuian symbols are hammered into the moonsilver panels adorning the case's doors. A highly polished, maple pantry sits next to the weapons case and bears the mark of the Leuian warrior on each of it's doors.  An east corridor, a west corridor, a golden flag, a redwood plaque, an open leather door, a closed grand oak door, an open Saldean crafted walnut weapons case, an open Leuian crafted oak trunk, and an open polished maple pantry are here.

Quietly, a yellow and black bumble bee flies around a small garden of fragrant violet orchids while a small bird eats some seed from a bird feeder hung on the walls of the fort. It is startled by approaching footsteps and flies off towards the northeast. A cool breeze carries the sweet scent of flowers, as the sound of distant fresh running water mumbles the whispered conversations of townspeople.  A closed maple door, a cozy cottage, a closed oak cottage door, a Pride Hall, and an exotic violet orchid box are here.

Within the heart of this proud fort one can see all around that the reconstruction of its buildings has begun. Large stones and logs have been stacked and piled, while some workers tirelessly attempt to repair the damage that occurred here during the Lords of Chaos wars. The buildings and homes of the people that resided here are slowly taking shape, though, far from completed. The smell of dyes, used to paint the town, permeate the area.  A breathtaking shimmering bouquet of moonflowers, an open light blue door, and a glowing wrought iron street lantern are here.

Off to the north one can make out the familiar sound of money. The clanking of coins can be heard distinctly. One of the only buildings that happened to survive in this fort from the days of lore, the bank. A small man can be seen traveling to and from the sidewalk to the very spot you are at with his hand held out and a look of sorrow in his eyes.

Behind the counter, busily working away, an old Fir Elf is taking the deposits of the travelers passing through. At another counter a young Usil Elf gives the withdraws to the merchants and passersby.

Two guards patrol above the gate, looking you over carefully before giving leave to pass through the heavy wood gate.

[Southern Tradeway.]

Rising up out of the plains, a large walled fort receives the end of the stone road. The river flows from either side, running through the fort from this angle of view. The vegetation surrounding the tradeway at this point has been burned out recently, allowing a clear field of vision from the tops of the walls ahead. The stones show little wear from the heavy traffic of feet and wheels alike; it has certainly been well constructed.

The grass rises taller and taller in every direction further limiting view just off the roadside. A second glance reveals that this is the lowest point in a large, shallow depression. The tradeway sinks a little lower as it gets closer to the river off to the west. A ditch runs alongside the river's side of the road, small puddles of water filling the bottom. Trickles filter into the puddles from the grass beyond as mosquitoes dart across the muddy surfaces.

Only the well-built, stone tradeway gives any hint of civilization ever having had any presence here. The tall grasses limit visibility nearby, hiding any wildlife that may be waiting for prey to stumble too close. A few blades of grass sway slightly in the breeze, some of them broken by the passing of something heavy over them. One of the larger stones in the road, broken loose from its mortar, waits patiently to be repaired.

The stone paved tradeway stretches across the open plains, interrupting nature's task of consuming the land. An endless sea of grass surrounds you, lapping at the road much like the tides against a beach. The faintly damp wind occasionally blowing in from the west smells of earth. Some of the stones in the road interlock together to form the crude image of a lion. There is no discerning if it was done on purpose or sheer accident.

The tradeway runs across the open grasslands northeast towards the Spur, and southwest towards distant lands and eventually, the coast. The plains to the south and east seem totally indifferent to your existence. Just ahead, a small path moves up a village of huts spread out in a semi-circle. In the center of the village a giant fire pit sits where barbarians who wander through the village can sit around to stay warm.  A worn grassy path is here.

Set within a wide tunnel leading through the hedge to the north is the Wilderness Gate. It separates the settled lands of Spur from the open plains to the south of the city. The plains stretch as far as the eyes can see, the horizon and the walls of the fort down the road the only blemishes of the grassy landscape in the distance. The stones of the road are smoothly set together, well built to withstand heavy travel.

[South gate.]

Through the gate lies the city of Spur, the major center of trade and civilization on the plains. The dusty road leading through the gates is well traveled, and walls of the city are in good repair. A small shack sits to the west of the road, during most times of the day a dusty coach can be seen waiting in front, its horses stomping with impatience to be gone. To the right of the door is a small window, its opening covered with metal bars. An old man, missing most of his teeth, waits patiently for the travelers to pay their fare, and then directs them into the waiting area. On the east side of the road a billowing multicolored tent has been erected, the hustle and bustle of merchants and customers can be seen coming and going at all times of the day.  A rainbow silk tent and an open iron gate are here.

[South Gate.]

A well-guarded gateway separates the city's residential district from the farmlands just beyond. Guards carefully eye all that enter or exit the city, beckoning gruffly to random travelers for a closer inspection. The structure of the guards' barracks is visible above the road to the west. A weathered wooden sign is posted by the gate.  An open stone gate, a wooden sign, a closed thick stone door, and a street lantern are here.

[Noble Way.]

The occasional locked gate marks the entrance to some of the more hidden estates of Spurs nobility. From this broad avenue, little can be seen of their splendor. Behind the imposing gate recedes a proud drive, disappearing mysteriously into the trees. If not for the large imposing tower rising above the hedges it would be hard to discern anything was beyond the gate. It is apparent the residents do not wish to be disturbed.  A street lantern, a closed morbius door, and an open black iron gate are here.

Majestic elms continue to line this broad roadway, sheltering the avenue on both sides and further enhancing the grandiose atmosphere. Fronting the beautiful homes, cobbled paths edged with narrow flower beds meander through nearby private gardens. Though they appear wonderful places to spend an afternoon or take a picnic, the glances from those tending the estates makes it clear they are only for the invited.  A street lantern is here.

[Noble Crossroads.]

A small roadway bordered by flowering hedges bisects the wide avenue of Noble Way at a right angle, heading east to west.  A thick, sturdy sign stands just off to the side of a charming path, its large friendly letters intent on luring travelers into the city's premiere roadstay, the Gilded Lion Inn. The entrance is clearly marked and welcoming, extending off to the southeast.  A wooden sign and a street lantern are here.

Occasional gates and driveways lead back into the well-kept estates of the city's nobility, breaking and adding interest to the defining plane of the walls lining Noble Way.

Numerous trees lining the avenue serve as the dividing border between the majestic estates of the nobility and the lightly traveled roadway. The estates themselves are noticeably closer to the avenue than those to the south. However, they are no easier to access, still protected by their own guarding walls, some covered with ivy or colorful blooming vines.  A street lantern is here.

The entire avenue is composed of fine cobblestone, each level with its neighbor, providing a smooth ride for passing carriages and horses.

The avenue comes to a fork, with Noble Way curving from south to the northwest. A side-street heading off to the east leads to an extremely well kept neighborhood that easily surpasses everything around it in splendor and magnificence.

Leaving the exceptionally wealthy estates of the Spurian nobility, Noble Way heads toward the Town Square to the northwest. Along the roadside can be seen the in-city homes of successful merchants and other wealthy citizens of the Spur. The homes display a slightly different style, perhaps they are not quite so restrained; a touch more exuberance and freedom with materials is displayed.  A street lantern is here.

Gazing down each of the nearby private drives reveals a glimpse of a luxurious home, each a miniature estate in its own right.

Noble Way continues to wind its way among the rather modestly sized, but elegant, homes of the Spur's successful. Many a peasant farmer may live in homes larger than these, but none can match the quality found here. A peaceful, luxurious feeling pervades this part of town; perhaps it is the drifting floral scents wafting from the well-tended gardens.

Many grand, even ostentatious, homes line this stretch of Noble Way. Most of the residents here were fortunate enough to be born into the right families.

An unusually large home, even for this part of town, lies off to the west. It seems as if one ambitious owner is slowly buying up the lots next to his and adding them to his own. Groundskeepers are at work in the surrounding gardens, trimming and raking, so intent on their work they do not bother to acknowledge the passing traffic on the road.  A street lantern is here.

An elegant, carved wooden sign hangs above the ornate gateway set into the massive wall that divides Spurs Noble District from the Town Square. You can make out city guardsmen peering down attentively at all that approach from their posts atop the imposing wall. They seem to take a greater interest in this part of town, though there does not seem to be anything threatening enough here to warrant such attention.

Standing next to the large iron gate that separates the center of town from those of the elite class are several of the Spurian Guard. They are here to assist all who pass with the simple kindness of opening a gate, or the more important task of escorting those in need to the bank or market. A young looking cadet rubs wax into the stones of the city wall, his task is daunting, but one that will teach him discipline.  An open iron gate and a street lantern are here.

The boughs of a large apple tree hang over the well tended avenue. Below the beautiful tree stands a small fountain. Atop the fountain is an intricately carved Secian who appears to be dancing with the water as it splashes around her. Set in the marble base is a small plaque that reads, "For those who have gone before us." Many stand for a moment as they pass this way, giving thanks for the gift of life that is given by both the apple tree and the Secians of long ago. Large piles of dirt and broken stone lay on either side of the street as workmen ready the east and west alleys for expansion.  A street lantern and a Secian etched moonsilver door are here.

Vast estates tower over the huge Spurian wall towards the south. The well-to-do who live in these homes idle away their days, enjoying the luxury of time. Standing next to a very empty lantern pole, a small Flerian child insists in a plaintive wail, that he had nothing to do with the missing lantern. The well-dressed guard that interrogates him keeps pointing at a small sack on the ground and its obvious contents.  An open small burlap sack and a street lantern are here.

The outward appearance of the people here seems a bit classier. Rich clothing and large coin purses are prevalent amongst the travelers. In fact, many of the folk heading into Town Square from the south are accompanied by large bodyguards to assure their safety. The well maintained road is lined with small brass lanterns, each swinging off an individual pole. No expense has been spared to keep those who travel this road safe from the hoodlums that relish the darkness.  A street lantern is here.

A small sign hangs from above the door of the well-kept store before you, telling you that it is a rune shop. The occasional bright flash of light from inside the store suggests all kinds of strange and rare magicks are being cast inside! Those who walk past you glance at the rune shop warily and hurry to get past it as quickly as possible. A small sign hangs from the doorknob of the store that reads "Flerians not allowed!"  An intricately carved oak door and a street lantern are here.

A squat ugly little shack stands somber on the eastern side of this well swept lane. A mysterious gothic structure rises from what was once scattered remains of an alchemy shop. A multi-colored stained glass window peers watchful from the crafty western building.

A low slung building resides on the west side of the street. Chanting can be heard from within.  Occasionally a few sparks rise into the sky, or some unwarranted raindrops begin, but they quickly are quelled. A large pair of wooden doors, their surface carved with rune symbols grace the entrance.  A street lantern and some open rune-etched wooden doors are here.

A massive circular stone platform stands to the side of Magick Lane, strangely entrancing runes carved on every inch of its sides. The symbol of the god Sa, a golden Dragon, fills the space along the top. Raw power and magick seem to flow from the platform, making the air around it crackle with energy. A small sign stands next to the platform with a single word written upon it.  A rune covered platform, a SIGN, and a street lantern are here.

The old temple that was here has been refurbished and now has a broad banner exclaiming "Gruggle's Emporium!"  Blue and red streamers cascade down from the pillars and a broad red carpet covers the steps of the building. Strange noises emanate from the interior of Gruggle's place. His ability to capture and tame even the most wild of animals is world renowned. The fact that many give wide berth around his doorway convinces any casual observer that Spurians are still not very confident in his capabilities.  A giant wooden arch and a street lantern are here.

A long-bearded Hithual carefully directs an eclectic group of workers in the building of a new shop. His calm voice points out those errors that would keep this building from being up to his high standards. Quality must be assured by this stout architect. The workers each take turns sitting beneath a large oak tree, a welcome relief from their hard work. A small sign next to the door proudly proclaims, "Pierini's Gems".  A beautiful large oak tree, a street lantern, and an open lacquered silver maple door are here.

The sweet melody of a stringed instrument floats out the open window of the sturdy building on the southern side of Rehas Way.

Built as a "home away from home," this building is an outlet of the famous Sigrid's Place in Saldaea. The small yard in front has carefully trimmed grass, surrounded by a low hedge. Small stepping stones bisect the yard leading you to a grand door bearing the signature "Crossed Swords." Traffic is heavy along this portion of Rehas Way. Even though it is a rare occurrence to find Sigrid or her Uncle Reyranald in attendance, when they are the line can quickly build around the block for a chance to purchase a weapon from them.  An open green steelwood door and a street lantern are here.

City guards lean over the walls above watching all who pass into the area. Some are stationed to help protect the interests of the traveling merchants, others to keep an eye on rogues. A large open area stands between the western Spurian Wall and Milene's Outpost. Deep ruts mar the ground, made from the traveling merchant wagons that are known to frequent this area. Whether they park for the evening or for a week, their goods are highly sought after.  An archway, a closed intricately carved steelwood door, an intricately carved steelwood sign, and a street lantern are here.

Shadowed by the wall that surrounds the city, this dark corner sees little traffic. Most Spurians access Rehas Way from Town Square, rather than through this arch. A thin sapling reaches valiantly for a sliver of sunlight. A drowsy guard on the wall above snaps to attention as his Captain approaches.  An archway is here.

Livestock pace nervously in an enclosure beside the road. Chickens and other fowl peck at the ground in a vain attempt to find some food. A large sow wallows in the mud at the back of the pen, adding to the smell. A few sheep are being herded towards the gate, unaware of the fate that awaits them.  A gateway is here.

Wall road is rife with hoofprints and tracks from wagon wheels leading to a large enclosure to the south. To those with two legs, the footing is somewhat difficult.

The relative safety inside Spur is a comfort to those returning from the fields and mountains. To those leaving, a massive wall of defense around the city lies ahead. Archer towers beside the gate overlook the wall, offering a painful welcome to would-be invaders. Several guards on foot patrol pass and disappear behind a thick, bluesteel banded steelwood door. Wall road stretches to the south, a wide passage between the city wall and several large buildings.  An open iron gate, an open thick stone door, and a street lantern are here.

Travelers from Rathan to the northwest, and the Trade Route to the south, converge at Spur's west gate. Guards posted on the ground give those seeking to enter the city a cursory once-over. Their lack of interest shows that anyone approaching has already been observed from above for some time. A grate in the ground loosens mud from wagon wheels and hooves before they pass through the gate, helping to keep the streets of Spur fairly clean.  An open giant black iron gate, a giant green oak tree, a small blue pool, a thick oak grate over the pool, and a polished stone marker are here.

What once was the intersection of two roads is now a single road paralleled by a massive amount of rock, mud and timber. A new landslide covers the older settled debris making passage to the northeast impossible. Rocks and pebbles lay across the path making movement precarious. The new landslide still groans and shifts ever so slightly.

Old trees lay side by side with the massive boulders of the mountain, intermingling in a terrible landslide. The mountain top has broken off and slid across the eastern road stopping all forms of transportation. It would take years for mortal hands to remove the tons of stone from the original roadway to make it passable once again. Thankfully, nature has changed the landscape for the better, and has opened a gap through the mountain to the north.

Huge boulders have created a bowl shaped depression in this sheltered hillock. A stand of scruffy trees continues to eke out a tenuous existence above the rocky outpost; their long tortured roots clinging desperately to what little soil is caught between the boulders. Prevailing winds from the mountaintop have caused the trunks to lean westward, the upper branches creating a canopy over the area.

Beneath the trees, many a caravan has stopped to water their draft animals and rest for the night. The area is strewn with animal refuse, bits of feed, and the resulting lingering aroma. The discarded feed and rubbish left by the travelers is picked over constantly by the hillock's inhabitants. In such a harsh environment, very little waste is left by the local scavengers.

A small spring fed stream meanders around the bowl, filling a pool on the western side of the path. A series of miniature waterfalls gurgle delightfully along the edges of the camp. The resulting pool is quite deep and crystal clear, even with the constant watering of pack animals. The flow of the spring must be constantly replenishing the pool, for no algae or slime clouds its depths.  A small crystal clear pool is here.

The boulders bear scars from deeply driven pinions and screws used to hold cables and reins, or perhaps impromptu corrals for the portage animals.

A lean-to built from odds and ends serves as a way station for exhausted travelers. Gathered firewood lines the lean-to's walls, and a small darkened pit smolders outside the opening. Inside the small, cramped lean-to, light filters in through the makeshift construction. The possibility of being snowed in and sheltering for a long period in this little hovel is not a welcome proposition.

While the tunnel is still well made and structurally sound, the air deep within is dank and moist. On closer inspection, hair-line fractures have appeared in the smoothly cut tunnel walls, allowing a few moist rivuletes to seep through onto the granite's surface.

Entering the foyer the first thing you notice is its subtle opulence. The floor is highly polished black marble, the walls are covered with a gold stripped, cream colored paper. Light filters in through a large paned glass window which, at one time must have glistened, but is now coated with the accumulation of years of dirt. A finely crafted staircase, its balustrade polished from many years of use, rises to the second floor unsupported.  A polished oak circular staircase and some open massive black obsidian double doors are here.

Two large oak doors are set in the eastern wall, their gilded handles have tarnished with time.

A quick peek through the slightly ajar door reveals a vast array of yellowing linens. A small old table leans precariously against the western wall of the hallway. Its size is just perfect to hold a variety of items the master and mistress might need brought upstairs by their servants.  An open polished oak door and an oak staircase are here.

On either side of a small oak table sit two large black velvet, high-back chairs. They create a quiet corner to sit unnoticed and watch the activity of the parlor.  An open thick oak door is here.

In this cavernous room much of the furniture is covered with sheets. The wooden floor has a light layer of dust dulling its shine. A large black aubusson rug, with gold flecks, graces the center of the room. Directly above it, a glass chandelier tinkles as it catches the breeze of your entrance.

Entering the foyer the first thing you notice is its subtle opulence. The floor is highly polished black marble, the walls are covered with a gold stripped, cream colored paper. Light filters in through a large paned glass window which, at one time must have glistened, but is now coated with the accumulation of years of dirt. A finely crafted staircase, its balustrade polished from many years of use, rises to the second floor unsupported.  A polished oak circular staircase and some open massive black obsidian double doors are here.

Set in the eastern wall is a polished oak door. Its diminutive size gives the impression that it was only used by servants. A large closet stands very close to the door. A quick peek through the slightly ajar door reveals a vast array of yellowing linens. A small old table leans precariously against the western wall of the hallway. Its size is just perfect to hold a variety of items the master and mistress might need brought upstairs by their servants.  An open polished oak door and an oak staircase are here.

Two gold brocade chairs rest against the eastern wall, a small oak table sits between them. Bumping up against either chair will get you a mouthful of choking dust.

Small knobs adorn the wall on either side of the circular staircase. Upon further inspection, these knobs are actually small ebony hands, palms up and fingers slightly curved into a grasping position. The minute appendages line the walls high and low, some still holding long iron pokers and malleable steel paddles, others serving as hooks for three-pronged barbed whips.  A cold spiraling stone staircase, a large glittering agate, a silver corkscrew, some gold coins, some silver coins, a beautiful red long-stemmed rose, a glittering diamond shard, a short steel butcher knife, and a large shiny green crystal are here.

Concentric circles of fire-blackened stone form an eerie pattern on the floor beneath a suspended platform. The platform, hanging haphazardly by pulleys from only two of its four corners, is crafted from loose sheets of ring mail.

[Third Floor, Ari'kian Keep.]

Heading off the main hallway is a smaller, less elaborate, branch. The marble flooring continues both directions, but it is plain to see that while no expense was spared in the main hallway, the small western hallway is stark in comparison. Two gold brocade chairs rest against the eastern wall, a small oak table sits between them. Bumping up against either chair will get you a mouthful of choking dust.

A beautiful black marble floor, accentuated by gold marbling throughout, continues to glisten through the light layer of dust that resides upon it. Against the gold papered walls stand two rather large smoke stained torcheries that have not been used for many years. A large black obsidian door graces the eastern wall.  An open large obsidian door is here.

The small landing of the third floor is elegantly decorated. Even time and dust have not ravished the understated opulence. A large crystal chandelier hangs from the ceiling, its teardrop crystals tinkling from the breeze entrance. A black velvet settee reclines against the wall below beautiful lead-paned windows framed with gold and black velvet drapes.  A polished oak staircase is here.

Entering the foyer the first thing you notice is its subtle opulence. The floor is highly polished black marble, the walls are covered with a gold stripped, cream colored paper. Light filters in through a large paned glass window which, at one time must have glistened, but is now coated with the accumulation of years of dirt. A finely crafted staircase, its balustrade polished from many years of use, rises to the second floor unsupported.

Worn boards of the porch creek against your weight. Two massive obsidian front doors stand before you. A tarnished brass knocker, in the shape of a demon head, glares down.

[Ari'kian Trail.]

A lavish garden stretches between a rocky cliff to the west and a dark keep to the east. The flowers and shrubbery are immaculate, but the landscape is strangely quiet and completely devoid of movement. The lively, vibrant colors of the blossoms contrast with the deathly stillness. A large tunnel descends into the depths of the cliff-face.

You follow Lorimah through a large tunnel...

[Ari'kian Trail.]

Old rusted sconces stand sentry along both sides of this end of the giant tunnel. While time has marred the surface of the tunnel walls with minute cracks, the absolute precision and remarkable smoothness of the carved rock are still very impressive. Fresh, cool air blows in from outside.  An exit is here.

The walls of the tunnel bear witness to the constant pressures of the tons of stone above. Water seeps through large fractures to a small pool. Small piles of rocks litter the floor and the air is heavy with moisture. Footsteps produce a crunching rhythm, out of sync with one's quickening heartbeat.

No exit is visible from this section of the tunnel, only a choice of east or west. A few hastily assembled wooden beams seem to support entire weight of the mountain. It is a harrowing thought to consider how much rock hangs on a these few prudently placed support beams made of decaying wood.  Some rotting wooden beams are here.

While the tunnel is still well made and structurally sound, the air deep within is dank and moist. On closer inspection, hair-line fractures have appeared in the smoothly cut tunnel walls, allowing a few moist rivuletes to seep through onto the granite's surface. The walls are streaked dark from the constant flow of the cold, clear water.

Huge boulders have created a bowl shaped depression in this sheltered hillock. A stand of scruffy trees continues to eke out a tenuous existence above the rocky outpost; their long tortured roots clinging desperately to what little soil is caught between the boulders.

Only the hardiest of life forms hold their own on the rocky steppes. Small cascades of icy water stream down the boulders and darken their surfaces.

A makeshift path has been created to circumvent the large tree that has fallen down and blocked the regular path. Lying on its side, the log stands two heads higher then the tallest Thugian. Its leafy top continues to grow, as if the fact that the roots are no longer bound to the ground makes no difference at all.

A small birds nest has been built within one of the larger cracks of the great tree. Twittering, chirping and the occasional rustling is quite noticeable from the nest as the babies all vie for whatever sustenance their parent brings. A quick flash red and mother bird flies off to find more worms.

The trail winds around the large fallen tree. Smaller saplings, and fungus grows in the soil that is being enriched by the decaying tree. Several rocks dot the newly carved trail around the tree, making travel difficult. It is fairly certain many have cursed the falling of this great tree, and subsequent detour.

A strong breeze blows off the mountains of the Great Divide. It both slows your climb and encourages your decent into the valley.

A wide rocky trail heads off into the mountainous terrain in an easterly direction. A large pile of rocks from an old landslide partially blocks passage in the other direction. Cracks and crevasses mar trail's surface, as runoff from the mountain snow makes its way to lower ground. Lush green bushes, and small trees dot the landscape, mingling with large boulders and smaller rocks.  A large pile of rocks is here.

Rough granite walls rise above you to the east and west. The area here is a bit rougher and seems to have been recently mined. Large veins of silver can be seen.

                        You have visualized the following locations
                        -------------------------------------------

                                    Visualization #1 is:
Through the gate lies the city of Spur, the major center of trade and civilization on the plains. The dusty road leading through the gates is well traveled, and walls of the city are in good repair. A small shack sits to the west of the road, during most times of the day a dusty coach can be seen waiting in front, its horses stomping with impatience to be gone. To the right of the door is a small window, its opening covered with metal bars. An old man, missing most of his teeth, waits patiently for the travelers to pay their fare, and then directs them into the waiting area. On the east side of the road a billowing multicolored tent has been erected, the hustle and bustle of merchants and customers can be seen coming and going at all times of the day.

                                    Visualization #2 is:
Each corner of this square gives entrance to one of the fort's four business establishments. The bank is small, but adequate. The pawnshop and store will see to your buying and selling needs, and the Tarath Wayside Inn is open at all hours to provide shelter for residents and foreigners alike.

                                    Visualization #3 is:
Contrasting starkly with the ashes of the forest and brush is a freshly constructed set of stairs that wraps itself about the large tree. The intricate woodwork that decorates the steps is of the finest quality, as if in parody to the blackened destruction of the hedges and brambles around the base of the trunk. Bright green leaves of clover have begun springing up through the ashy soil in conjunction with soft moss to lend a durable cushion to this well-traveled spot.

[The Silver Strand.]

Another massive boulder, black and melted, blocks any further passage toward the top of the mountain. Thick grey and white clouds hang heavily near the edge of the road, swirling ever so slightly in the breeze. There is no way to continue up the mountain except perhaps by climbing the sheer cliff wall. The clouds pulse slightly and gravitate toward the road surface, the sound of thunder rolling over the area.

You follow Lorimah through some white billowy clouds...

[The Silver Strand.]

A ribbon of pure silver stretches out through the billowing clouds toward the peak of the mountain. Each step is like walking on soft carpeting but without any solid underfooting to hold one up. Any movement on the silver strand makes the surface flow like the waves on the ocean, rippling into the distance.

[The Silver Strand.]

The strand twists and stretches and in some parts is not entirely there. Large holes open and close on its surface but without fail passage over these rifts is made without any problems. Above and surrounding the strand, the billowing clouds make up the walls of a silky tunnel, flickering with light and the sounds of rolling thunder every so often. The tunnel leads east to a solid mountain roadway and west into a blur.

[The Silver Strand.]

The strand and tunnel end abruptly before you, dispersing in the strong wind that blows down from the mountain. The next steps will have you hundreds of feet above the mountain base, standing on nothing but air, all solid footing gone. Across this long gap, on its otherside, the silver strand and the cloud tunnel begin again, making their way toward the mountain tower.

[Sky.]

There is nothing here but the open expanse of sky. A silvery walkway ends quite close to the east, its semi-solid footing welcome to most who cannot fly. Far northeast another part of the strand waits for a traveler to set foot on its surface to continue the journey up the mountain. A strong wind blows down from the mountain peak, attempting to bring the massive drop to the ground quickly and painfully to anyone stupid enough to wander out into the sky.  A fiery gate in the sky is here.

[Sky.]

Nothing but sky and mountains stretch out on all sides. The drop from this height would surely be deadly to anyone. A sliver of silver glints in the distance, rolling slightly within a wall of clouds. To the northeast, as if floating in the sky, a large tower hovers under it's own power. A small white curl of smoke reaches out from the tower towards the small silver path.  Some alabaster upwards leading stairs are here.

The narrow silver strand bends and stretches as it begins again. Billowing clouds part long enough for one to glimpse the entire southern half of Tarath Bends in all of its majesty. Though the strand carries its travelers higher above the mountain, the walk itself acts as if one were walking a level roadway.

The purple and silver glow brightens as the tunnel walls begin to fully dissipate in the mountain breeze. To the north the partially hidden spire of a massive tower pokes through the glistening cloud cover. A purple glow reflects through the cover and across the face of the building, beautifully accented by the silver trim and polished silver spire.

The strand has totally solidified, its silver-black surface smooth and shiny. A low humming sound permeates the air along with short thunderous bursts and flickers of lightning.

The strand widens toward the base of the tower, its silver-black surface reflecting the purple light from the walls. The tower is now completely in view, its walls not just glowing purple, but made of some sort of deep purple crystal magickally infused with a glowing light. There is but a single entrance gate and one narrow window slit high above the ground noticeable with a first glance. The silver spire hums slightly giving off a beautiful tune.

[The Crystal Tower.]

A massive purple crystal tower soars overhead, its silver spire polished to a bright shine. The walls pulse slightly as if beating like a massive heart. The mountain peak rises high on either side of the building, cradling the tower in its grasp. A massive gate protects the tower interior from any who do not belong.   An open silver-trimmed purple crystal gate is here.

Powerful magickal energy flashes through the air every so often, the redish-blue bolts dancing off the walls, ceiling and floor. An odd Thugian sized box rests against the rear wall; piles of crystal, drathian and granite dust lay on the floor.  A glowing white archway is here.

The darkness of this area is unmatched by the outer cave. You have entered a winding tunnel carved out of solid volcanic rock, perhaps a burned out age old lava tube. Now only sheer blackness flows through this tunnel. You have trouble with your sense of direction, the only beacon being the silvery door to the south.  A giant silvery door, a large white pearl, some gold coins, some silver coins, a pair of old faded socks, a blackened lava rock, a light bone wishbone, a broken wooden cart wheel, and a closed beaded pouch are here.

The darkness of this area is unmatched by the outer cave. You have entered a winding tunnel carved out of solid volcanic rock, perhaps a burned out age old lava tube. Now only sheer blackness flows through this tunnel. You have trouble with your sense of direction, the only beacon being the silvery door to the south.  A giant silvery door, a short iron frying pan, a dented tin kettle, a large tin cup, a blue and white striped plate, and a red coral figurine are here.

This area is not illuminated.
In the area are Audun the Noble Leuian, Draclaw the Novice Leuian, Lorimah the Noble Leuian, Tau the Leuian, Kenetic the Leuian, and Snowball the Leuian.

[Shadowy Lair]

Here the tunnel takes a dark turn, almost causing you to run into the wall. The jagged hardened spikes of ash look less than inviting. The shadows slowly begin to converge all around you. Total silence echos throughout the place. Did your own shadow just move?  A ball of string, a steelwood shield, an ancient dusty cask of aged brandy, an iron chainmail coif, a wooden toothpick, a closed large wicker skep, a porcelain jug, a handmade colorful glass bottle, a bronze mace, a drum, some blood-stained leather gloves, a short wooden stick, a flower, some weathered black bearskin furs, a button eyed sock puppet, an iridescent black crow's feather, an Elindalian wildflower, and a shiny golden trinket are here.

Here the tunnel takes a dark turn, almost causing you to run into the wall. The jagged hardened spikes of ash look less than inviting. The shadows slowly begin to converge all around you. Total silence echos throughout the place. Did your own shadow just move?  A closed corroded brass coffer is here.

This area is not illuminated.
In the area are Audun the Noble Leuian, Draclaw the Novice Leuian, Tau the Leuian, Kenetic the Leuian, and Snowball the Leuian.

You stumble along further into the darkness.  Your shadow seems to move more quickly than yourself along the ash covered walls.

Shadows dance along the smooth black walls, mimicking your movements.

[Laboratory and Experiment Area.]

Long tables filled with various magickal devices, scrolls and containers of strange items line the far corner walls forming an "L". The walls pulse slightly, the purple glow covering almost every item within the room, giving everything a strange purple hue. Powerful magickal energy flashes through the air every so often, the redish-blue bolts dancing off the walls, ceiling and floor. An odd Thugian sized box rests against the rear wall; piles of crystal, drathian and granite dust lay on the floor.  A glowing white archway is here.

Strange and wonderful smells assault the senses at the top of the spiral staircase. Odd clicking and the sound of birds singing can be hear all around, though there are no animals or anything else around to make them. The air is thick and misty, almost as if the clouds had rolled in on top of you.  A silver-trimmed spiraling crystal stairway is here.

Like the first floor, the walls of the second rise up and angle slightly inward from floor to ceiling. Because of this, the area of the second floor is noticeably smaller then that of the first.

One of the larger golems stands straight against the wall, this one different from the others, its massive body almost completely clear and hard as a rock.

The dark purple walls of the tower swirl and shimmer as if alive. Sparkling light, rose in color, reflects from the crystal and sends its beams across the floor and ceiling.

[The Crystal Tower.]

A massive purple crystal tower soars overhead, its silver spire polished to a bright shine. The walls pulse slightly as if beating like a massive heart.

The strand widens toward the base of the tower, its silver-black surface reflecting the purple light from the walls. The tower is now completely in view, its walls not just glowing purple, but made of some sort of deep purple crystal magickally infused with a glowing light. There is but a single entrance gate and one narrow window slit high above the ground noticeable with a first glance. The silver spire hums slightly giving off a beautiful tune.

Nothing but sky and mountains stretch out on all sides. The drop from this height would surely be deadly to anyone. A sliver of silver glints in the distance, rolling slightly within a wall of clouds. To the northeast, as if floating in the sky, a large tower hovers under it's own power. A small white curl of smoke reaches out from the tower towards the small silver path.  Some alabaster upwards leading stairs are here.

There is nothing here but the open expanse of sky. A silvery walkway ends quite close to the east, its semi-solid footing welcome to most who cannot fly. Far northeast another part of the strand waits for a traveler to set foot on its surface to continue the journey up the mountain. A strong wind blows down from the mountain peak, attempting to bring the massive drop to the ground quickly and painfully to anyone stupid enough to wander out into the sky.  A fiery gate in the sky is here.

The strand and tunnel end abruptly before you, dispersing in the strong wind that blows down from the mountain.

The strand twists and stretches and in some parts is not entirely there. Large holes open and close on its surface but without fail passage over these rifts is made without any problems. Above and surrounding the strand, the billowing clouds make up the walls of a silky tunnel, flickering with light and the sounds of rolling thunder every so often. The tunnel leads east to a solid mountain roadway and west into a blur.

A ribbon of pure silver stretches out through the billowing clouds toward the peak of the mountain. Each step is like walking on soft carpeting but without any solid underfooting to hold one up.

Another massive boulder, black and melted, blocks any further passage toward the top of the mountain. Thick grey and white clouds hang heavily near the edge of the road, swirling ever so slightly in the breeze.

Cold air blows down from the higher parts of the mountain, shaking leaves and dust into a frenzy every so often.

The roadway straightens out to the west but continues its incline along the base of the mountain. The walls of Fort Tarath stand tall between the walls of the gorge almost as if daring an army to try and breech them. Large piles of blackened rubble, the product of the roadway excavation, fill the narrow valley between the road edge and the mountain to the south.

This newly constructed road begins the climb to the mountain peaks as a vein from the main Rathan-Fort Tarath artery. Following the steep incline of the mountain's side, this twisting path travels its way to the opposite side of the City of Rathan. High above in that part of the mountain, a single silver-spired tower peaks through the misty mountain air and glistens slightly.

[Tarath Gorge and The Silver Strand.]

The gorge continues onward as far as the eye can see while a newly excavated road opens up northwest. Black soot and ash, along with grey flecked dust has settled on everything in the area. A cool breeze rushes in from the new roadway, blowing with it the scent of moist air.

The giant fortification wall is divided into two main sections by huge doors.  These doors have been made from silver and look as though they could stand even the most fearsome battering ram.  Guards standing atop the walls eye you closely.  To the north you can see the business district.  An open silver-trimmed black drathain gate is here.

You stand before a granite wall and large double gated doors. The walls are thick and finely crafted, and there seems to be a rather aged look about them.  The Gate is made of massive slabs of silver, while off to the left and right are the fort's impressive walls, able to withstand a rather large invasion or army if need be.

Rough granite walls rise above you to the east and west. The area here is a bit rougher and seems to have been recently mined. Large veins of silver can be seen.

Old trees lay side by side with the massive boulders of the mountain, intermingling in a terrible landslide.

It would take years for mortal hands to remove the tons of stone from the original roadway to make it passable once again. Thankfully, nature has changed the landscape for the better, and has opened a gap through the mountain to the north.

Travelers from Rathan to the northwest, and the Trade Route to the south, converge at Spur's west gate. Guards posted on the ground give those seeking to enter the city a cursory once-over. Their lack of interest shows that anyone approaching has already been observed from above for some time. A grate in the ground loosens mud from wagon wheels and hooves before they pass through the gate, helping to keep the streets of Spur fairly clean.

The buildings have been built to last, as these merchants are no traveling tinkers. Interlocking stone walkways and colorful plantings span this central area. Despite the number of animals waiting outside the bank for their owners, the area is spotless. Loud chatter in many languages can be heard from the southwest.

Crowds of people push past, some brushing against you. It might be a good idea to keep an eye on your coinpurse.  A street lantern is here.

[Trade Way & Bazaar Path.]

A path to the north winds its way among various stalls and tents. Some specialty outlets can be found, provided one does not get lost in this maze known as the Bazaar. More permanent structures to the south suggest finer goods as well as increased security.  A street lantern is here.

Many townsfolk pass along this busy thoroughfare. Rich and poor alike mix freely on this street, much to the dismay of a passing nobleman. A young human struggles with an armful of packages and two young children in tow. Those in need of goods or supplies head west towards the market, those looking for the news of the day head east towards Town Square.  A street lantern is here.

A large gate separates the Merchant District and Town Square-the hub of Spur's activity. The partially opened gate is currently able to accommodate the simultaneous passage of several locals and visitors, but can be expanded to accept carriages, or sealed to ward against invasion.  Guards stand sentry from atop the wall as well as the ground.  A street lantern is here.

[Merchant Walk.]

Merchant Walk comes to an abrupt end at a massive moonsilver gate. The towering walls of Spur on either side of the gates force all to pass by the guards who are constantly on the watch for thieves and bandits. Just beyond the gates one can glimpse the bustling Merchant District of Spur.  A gilded oak sign and a street lantern are here.

[Merchant Walk.]

Several city guardsmen have just finished wrestling to the ground some young tough thieves, who thought to rob one of the returning merchants. To one side a relieved-looking Fir Elf gentleman holds on tightly to his gold-tipped walking stick, as the human boy yells his innocence to any who might listen. His pleas fall on deaf ears as the guards drag him away.  A street lantern is here.

[Merchant Walk.]

Merchants, some in frilly finery, others dressed in homespun wools, travel back and forth along this street on their way to and from work. They seem to blend together here, if only briefly. Several of the more haughty looking merchants are trailed by overloaded carts pushed along by haggard young apprentices.   A street lantern is here.

A neatly kept park fronts this portion of Merchant Walk. Topiary and low shrubberies partition off small sections of the park. Young lovers sit on benches almost hidden from view, gazing at each other with looks of love, oblivious to the continual bustle of passing customers and merchants on their way to do business.  A street lantern is here.

Neatly trimmed shrubbery line well-maintained cobblestones along Merchant Walk. Apprentices rush by carrying supplies and orders, carrying out their masters' business. Several wooden benches line the walk for those customers who need to rest from the strain of carrying heavy parcels.  A street lantern is here.

[Town Square West.]

People carrying bundles stream in from the west and rapidly lose themselves in the large crowds moving about in the vast town square. Several citizens head west with bulging coinpurses babbling excitedly about what they're going to purchase. Giggling children dart around the slower moving folks rushing on their way to spend the silvers in their pockets.  A street lantern is here.

[Town Square Center.]

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.   A flowing white marble fountain, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a cracked marble statue of a Human, a carved marble statue of a Dragon, a rosewood sign, some flaming ruby ashes, a deep fluffy snow drift, an empty glass jigger of whiskey, and some vomit are here.

You see the 1st wolf (wearing a small gold collar) and the 1st raven (wearing a small gold collar).
In the area are Sindelle the San Elf, Treyfalgar the Noble San Elf, Gemma the Human, and Bushwig the Go-blin-al.

Treyfalgar says to Bushwig, "i'd be happy to escort you there next time"
[Town Square.]

The elegant Hotel Royale towers above the street, its emerald door sparkling in the light. The patrons that stroll in and out are catered to, doors opened and closed for them, and baggage and packages carried by harried servants. The large Bank of Spur sits on the east side of the square. Its location close to the Royale is not a coincidence. A gold-trimmed door is proof of the success of this branch of the Spurian bank and those who run it.  An elegant gold-trimmed walnut door, open emerald steel door, and a street lantern are here.

[The Royale.]

A short entrance hall provides passage in and out of the exquisite Hotel Royale. A burly Thugian and a tall Monitanian carefully assess everyone as they enter. They prevent any pets from entering and keep out all but the quickest or sneakiest of the riffraff. A narrow passageway leads to the stables.  An open emerald steel door is here.
