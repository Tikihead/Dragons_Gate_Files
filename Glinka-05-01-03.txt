You are getting closer to the sandstone building you glimpsed before.  It appears to be an old house, most likely that of a merchant.  Once grand in design, it has now fallen into disrepair, its sandstone walls tarnished with the grime of disinterest.

A one-story white sandstone building with a heavy steelwood door stands before you. The windows are barred with intricate iron working. A true Hithual craftsman must have aided in the design of this once grand home. People quickly pass in and out through the now marred wooden door with bundles under their arms or in tow. The windows are too dark to peer into, and you decide that the only way to get a good look is to try going inside.   An open handmade steelwood door is here.

The interior of the house is dark and smells a bit musty. There is minimal furniture: a short table, some old dusty pillows big enough to sit on, and a cabinet. The floor has a few layers of grime on it, as do the walls. A moth-eaten rug covers the floor, and an old fireplace sits unused. Strangely, no one seems to be around. Towards the back of the room you see a colorful beaded curtain that leads to another room.

The interior of the house is dark and smells a bit musty. There is minimal furniture: a short table, some old dusty pillows big enough to sit on, and a cabinet. The floor has a few layers of grime on it, as do the walls. A moth-eaten rug covers the floor, and an old fireplace sits unused. Strangely, no one seems to be around. Towards the back of the room you see a colorful beaded curtain that leads to another room.   An open handmade steelwood door, a colorful beaded curtain, a short table, and some old dusty silk pillows are here.

A one-story white sandstone building with a heavy steelwood door stands before you. The windows are barred with intricate iron working. A true Hithual craftsman must have aided in the design of this once grand home. People quickly pass in and out through the now marred wooden door with bundles under their arms or in tow. The windows are too dark to peer into, and you decide that the only way to get a good look is to try going inside.   An open handmade steelwood door is here.

Thankfully the air here is a little clearer, although the sights are not any better. A few feet away two hungry Thugians are fighting over the corpse of a dead rabid dog. They stop long enough to glance your way, look back at the dog's corpse, and then stare thoughtfully at each other - well, as thoughtful as a Thugian can be. They lumber to their feet and start heading your way, but halfway to you they start fighting with each other. You decide this is a good moment to move along quickly.

The dried trees encroach even up to the roadside, here, their limbs reaching down to the passage as if to snatch the unwary passer-by. A sudden shift in the wind brings forth the sullied aroma of death and decay from the swamp southern lands. Slurpish noises belie the path of some creature traveling through the muddy scape, their movements hidden behind the smoky mist that reduces visibility to a mere few feet past the swamp's edge.

A white mile-marking stone rises up from the muck near the path, the numbers etched into its surface gathering moss and sludge in their inner edges. A small marsh rat perches atop the stone, eyeing you hungrily with glittering red orbs, its whiskers twitching nervously at you.

Eyes of creatures too quick to be seen monitor your progress along the road. Their footprints can be seen occasionally, leading back and forth across the path, sometimes following along the edges, bringing to mind the vision of something that might be following you, at this very moment, leaving tiny or perhaps not so tiny footprints along the edge of the road as it stalks its prey.

Ravens dark as pitch spread their feathers to a wing-span of nearly four feet, so large they are, as they quarrel over an abandoned mule carcass on the roadside breaks out. How final death seems, so casually nature simply encompasses the bodies of the fallen, through carrion hunters or moldy decay. Yet through death there be life again, any number of these ravens being sustained through this death, so they may live. Perhaps only to become sustenance for one of the swamp creatures, who, in turn, spends its life continuing the cycle.

A small orb of light hovers in the center of the path before you, only to disappear as you near it, reappearing further away into the swamp. Stepping near the orb to investigate closer only causes it to again blink out of existence, forming once more, deeper into the mists. It soon becomes apparent that the mysterious lights are attempting to slyly lead you into the swamp. To or for what purpose, is the question.

The points of light are becoming bolder, flitting closer and closer to you and beckoning you to join them in the swamp. You must actively concentrate to avoid straying from the path and being hopelessly mired in the swamp.

The swamp around you begins to thin out until it's nothing more than a very muddy marsh. The tiny lights still sparkle from within the swamp and are calling to you, but not as strongly as before. Another white marker is here.  A closed iron gate is here.

The white paving stones give way to a boardwalk made of wooden planks.  The wood doesn't appear to be of Spurian make, and looks a great deal older, but very sturdy.  A finely crafted wooden boardwalk is here.

The scraggly weeds of the marsh seem to grow so that they do not touch the road, as opposed to the Spurian road where all the vegetation was hacked off near it.  Even though they are old, the planks bear no moss.

You hear voices chattering around you but you can't see the source.  After a few moments of listening, you look up into a tree next to the path and see three Fir Elves sitting in the tree talking to each other.  They smile down at you and give you a friendly greeting.

All around you the earth is trampled flat.  You see a myriad of footprints and hoofprints in every direction.  A broken post on the side of the road may have once had a sign on it, but was snapped off near the ground.  It looks like someone left here in a hurry.  A broken post is here.

Stepping off the path has proven unwise, indeed! You find yourself bogged down in a quagmire. Regaining the safety of the trail proves impossible. Your every movement causes you to sink farther into the muddy depths of the marsh. A vine is hanging only a few feet above your head.

The footbridge that once connected this path to its match on the other side of the overflowing rushing river is now nothing more then a few charred pilings. Tiny insects buzz around their remains, finding a comfortable new home. Lashed to the remains of one of the more sturdy pilings is a tall steel pole. Wrapped around the pole, and tied securely is a taut rope. Bobbing ever so lightly due to the strain of the riverboat, the rope holds tight.  A flowing river, a freshly painted sign, and some carved oak benches are here.
