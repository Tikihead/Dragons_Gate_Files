You follow Dash east...

[Merchant Walk.]

Merchants, some in frilly finery, others dressed in homespun wools, travel back and forth along this street on their way to and from work. They seem to blend together here, if only briefly. Several of the more haughty looking merchants are trailed by overloaded carts pushed along by haggard young apprentices.   A street lantern is here.

Obvious paths: east* west*.

You follow Dash east...

[Merchant Walk.]

A neatly kept park fronts this portion of Merchant Walk. Topiary and low shrubberies partition off small sections of the park. Young lovers sit on benches almost hidden from view, gazing at each other with looks of love, oblivious to the continual bustle of passing customers and merchants on their way to do business.  A street lantern is here.

[Merchant Walk.]

Neatly trimmed shrubbery line well-maintained cobblestones along Merchant Walk. Apprentices rush by carrying supplies and orders, carrying out their masters' business. Several wooden benches line the walk for those customers who need to rest from the strain of carrying heavy parcels.  A street lantern is here.

[Town Square West.]

People carrying bundles stream in from the west and rapidly lose themselves in the large crowds moving about in the vast town square. Several citizens head west with bulging coinpurses babbling excitedly about what they're going to purchase. Giggling children dart around the slower moving folks rushing on their way to spend the silvers in their pockets.  A street lantern is here.

You follow Dash southeast...

[Town Square South.]

The outward appearance of the people here seems a bit classier. Rich clothing and large coin purses are prevalent amongst the travelers. In fact, many of the folk heading into Town Square from the south are accompanied by large bodyguards to assure their safety. The well maintained road is lined with small brass lanterns, each swinging off an individual pole. No expense has been spared to keep those who travel this road safe from the hoodlums that relish the darkness.  A street lantern and a bloody thief arm are here.

This area is illuminated.
You see the 1st downy feathered snow owl (wearing a small gold collar).
In the area are Dash the Leuian and Isahn the Psycian.
Obvious paths: north* northeast* east* south* west* northwest*.

You follow Dash south...

[Southern Avenue.]

Smooth stones make up the street that leads from the center of Spur to the south. Each stone has been carefully fitted for the most comfortable travel by both cart and traveler alike. A well dressed Guard patrols the area in his dress uniform. Captains don't allow for slovenly appearances on this patrol.  A street lantern is here.

[Southern Avenue.]

Southern Avenue leads between the center of Spur and the homes of the prosperous and wealthy. Several of the Ladies of the city stroll along the avenue chatting about the current events and latest gossip of the Spur. Behind them, harried servants carry their reticules and all those belongings that they cannot be without.  A street lantern is here.

[Southern Avenue.]

Vast estates tower over the huge Spurian wall towards the south. The well-to-do who live in these homes idle away their days, enjoying the luxury of time. Standing next to a very empty lantern pole, a small Flerian child insists in a plaintive wail, that he had nothing to do with the missing lantern. The well-dressed guard that interrogates him keeps pointing at a small sack on the ground and its obvious contents.  An open small burlap sack, a street lantern, and a lantern are here.

[Southern Avenue & Gorey Street.]

The boughs of a large apple tree hang over the well tended avenue. Below the beautiful tree stands a small fountain. Atop the fountain is an intricately carved Secian who appears to be dancing with the water as it splashes around her. Set in the marble base is a small plaque that reads, "For those who have gone before us." Many stand for a moment as they pass this way, giving thanks for the gift of life that is given by both the apple tree and the Secians of long ago. Large piles of dirt and broken stone lay on either side of the street as workmen ready the east and west alleys for expansion.  A street lantern, an open Secian etched moonsilver door, a pair of open silver forged swinging doors, and a sign above the doors are here.

[Southern Avenue.]

Standing next to the large iron gate that separates the center of town from those of the elite class are several of the Spurian Guard. They are here to assist all who pass with the simple kindness of opening a gate, or the more important task of escorting those in need to the bank or market. A young looking cadet rubs wax into the stones of the city wall, his task is daunting, but one that will teach him discipline.  An open iron gate and a street lantern are here.

[Gateway.]

An elegant, carved wooden sign hangs above the ornate gateway set into the massive wall that divides Spurs Noble District from the Town Square. You can make out city guardsmen peering down attentively at all that approach from their posts atop the imposing wall. They seem to take a greater interest in this part of town, though there does not seem to be anything threatening enough here to warrant such attention.  A street lantern and a gilded silver plaque are here.

[Noble Way.]

To the north, you can make out an ornately scrolled gateway set in the base of the imposing city wall. The refined roadway of Noble Way stretches out to the south. The cobblestones of the road are smooth and even. The attention to detail shown here is a dramatic change from some of the other parts of the city.  A street lantern is here.

[Noble Way.]

An unusually large home, even for this part of town, lies off to the west. It seems as if one ambitious owner is slowly buying up the lots next to his and adding them to his own. Groundskeepers are at work in the surrounding gardens, trimming and raking, so intent on their work they do not bother to acknowledge the passing traffic on the road.  A street lantern is here.

This area is illuminated.
In the area is Dash the Leuian.
Obvious paths: north* southwest*.

You follow Dash southwest...

[Noble Way.]

Many grand, even ostentatious, homes line this stretch of Noble Way. Most of the residents here were fortunate enough to be born into the right families. Few that live in this area have ever actually had to work for a living. Glancing at the nameplates reveals many of the recognizable names of the Spur. Some of these names could almost be considered famous.  A street lantern is here.

[Noble Way.]

Noble Way continues to wind its way among the rather modestly sized, but elegant, homes of the Spur's successful. Many a peasant farmer may live in homes larger than these, but none can match the quality found here. A peaceful, luxurious feeling pervades this part of town; perhaps it is the drifting floral scents wafting from the well-tended gardens.  A closed elegant black iron gate and a street lantern are here.

Gazing down each of the nearby private drives reveals a glimpse of a luxurious home, each a miniature estate in its own right. Short, stout walls and manicured hedges serve to keep out the riffraff and to protect the small, expensive gardens. Every detail has been attended to display the exotic plants, in all their pampered perfection.  A street lantern and a closed rosewood door are here.

[Noble Way.]

Leaving the exceptionally wealthy estates of the Spurian nobility, Noble Way heads toward the Town Square to the northwest. Along the roadside can be seen the in-city homes of successful merchants and other wealthy citizens of the Spur. The homes display a slightly different style, perhaps they are not quite so restrained; a touch more exuberance and freedom with materials is displayed.  A street lantern is here.

[Intersection.]

The avenue comes to a fork, with Noble Way curving from south to the northwest. A side-street heading off to the east leads to an extremely well kept neighborhood that easily surpasses everything around it in splendor and magnificence. Everything, even the carefully pruned trees and the manicured shrubbery displays a desire for elegant perfection.  A street lantern is here.

[Noble Way.]

The entire avenue is composed of fine cobblestone, each level with its neighbor, providing a smooth ride for passing carriages and horses. The stones were customized by craftsmen, cut to order, rather than simply placed wherever they might fit. A few stately oaks and elms line the sides of the road, shading travelers during the daylight hours.  A street lantern is here.

Numerous trees lining the avenue serve as the dividing border between the majestic estates of the nobility and the lightly traveled roadway. The estates themselves are noticeably closer to the avenue than those to the south. However, they are no easier to access, still protected by their own guarding walls, some covered with ivy or colorful blooming vines.  A street lantern is here.

Occasional gates and driveways lead back into the well-kept estates of the city's nobility, breaking and adding interest to the defining plane of the walls lining Noble Way. The rest of the street seems to mimic the splendor of the estates beyond the wall. Swept and trimmed, the roadway exudes a simple, yet beautiful elegance.  A street lantern is here.

[Noble Crossroads.]

A small roadway bordered by flowering hedges bisects the wide avenue of Noble Way at a right angle, heading east to west.  A thick, sturdy sign stands just off to the side of a charming path, its large friendly letters intent on luring travelers into the city's premiere roadstay, the Gilded Lion Inn. The entrance is clearly marked and welcoming, extending off to the southeast.  A wooden sign and a street lantern are here.

Majestic elms continue to line this broad roadway, sheltering the avenue on both sides and further enhancing the grandiose atmosphere. Fronting the beautiful homes, cobbled paths edged with narrow flower beds meander through nearby private gardens. Though they appear wonderful places to spend an afternoon or take a picnic, the glances from those tending the estates makes it clear they are only for the invited.  A street lantern is here.

The occasional locked gate marks the entrance to some of the more hidden estates of Spurs nobility. From this broad avenue, little can be seen of their splendor. Behind the imposing gate recedes a proud drive, disappearing mysteriously into the trees. If not for the large imposing tower rising above the hedges it would be hard to discern anything was beyond the gate. It is apparent the residents do not wish to be disturbed.  A street lantern, a closed morbius door, and an open black iron gate are here.

[South Gate.]

A well-guarded gateway separates the city's residential district from the farmlands just beyond. Guards carefully eye all that enter or exit the city, beckoning gruffly to random travelers for a closer inspection. The structure of the guards' barracks is visible above the road to the west. A weathered wooden sign is posted by the gate.  An open stone gate, a wooden sign, an open thick stone door, and a street lantern are here.

[South gate.]

Through the gate lies the city of Spur, the major center of trade and civilization on the plains. The dusty road leading through the gates is well traveled, and walls of the city are in good repair. A small shack sits to the west of the road, during most times of the day a dusty coach can be seen waiting in front, its horses stomping with impatience to be gone. To the right of the door is a small window, its opening covered with metal bars. An old man, missing most of his teeth, waits patiently for the travelers to pay their fare, and then directs them into the waiting area. On the east side of the road a billowing multicolored tent has been erected, the hustle and bustle of merchants and customers can be seen coming and going at all times of the day.  An open iron gate and a rainbow silk tent are here.

[Path to Shack]

A dusty path leads along the edge of the city wall up to a small shack where a number of carriages sit out front. A small sign stuck in the dirt in front of the shack provides information about when the carriages leave, where they travel to, and how much the trips cost.  A freshly painted sign, a notice of non-refund, and a small shack are here.

[Road.]

Even though it shows heavy wear, the road is in remarkably good repair. It was built by expert craftsmen to withstand the rigors of time and use. Evidence of recent repairs indicate that any problems are dealt with quickly and competently.  Some dried crimson streaks of blood and an open old wooden trash wagon are here.

[Field.]

A broad strip of grassland that follows the main road east of you, this meadow is often used by the local aristocracy for picnicking and partying on good days. The city guardsmen keep the field clear of riffraff all year round, just to be safe.  A hole is here.

[Tiny cave.]

This rough-hewn cavern is eerily lit by several glowing crystals set in the roof over head. A pile of freshly gnawed fishbones sits in one corner, evidence that something lives here. Two passageways lead from the cavern, the occasional bellow from each alerting you to the presence of orks. A faint breeze comes through the crack you have crawled through.

[Whispering Cave]

This cavern is dominated by the pool of water off to one side. Several corpse-white fish swim lazily in it, sightless eyes staring into eternity. Near the back, almost hidden in shadows, lies an ancient blackened altar. Strange sounds echo in the cave, almost like whispers in some alien tongue.  A pool and a blackened stone altar are here.

Even though it shows heavy wear, the road is in remarkably good repair. It was built by expert craftsmen to withstand the rigors of time and use. Evidence of recent repairs indicate that any problems are dealt with quickly and competently.  Some dried crimson streaks of blood and an open old wooden trash wagon are here.

[South gate.]

Through the gate lies the city of Spur, the major center of trade and civilization on the plains. The dusty road leading through the gates is well traveled, and walls of the city are in good repair. A small shack sits to the west of the road, during most times of the day a dusty coach can be seen waiting in front, its horses stomping with impatience to be gone. To the right of the door is a small window, its opening covered with metal bars. An old man, missing most of his teeth, waits patiently for the travelers to pay their fare, and then directs them into the waiting area. On the east side of the road a billowing multicolored tent has been erected, the hustle and bustle of merchants and customers can be seen coming and going at all times of the day.  An open iron gate and a rainbow silk tent are here.

[Noble Way.]

The occasional locked gate marks the entrance to some of the more hidden estates of Spurs nobility. From this broad avenue, little can be seen of their splendor. Behind the imposing gate recedes a proud drive, disappearing mysteriously into the trees. If not for the large imposing tower rising above the hedges it would be hard to discern anything was beyond the gate. It is apparent the residents do not wish to be disturbed.  A street lantern, a closed morbius door, and an open black iron gate are here.

Majestic elms continue to line this broad roadway, sheltering the avenue on both sides and further enhancing the grandiose atmosphere. Fronting the beautiful homes, cobbled paths edged with narrow flower beds meander through nearby private gardens. Though they appear wonderful places to spend an afternoon or take a picnic, the glances from those tending the estates makes it clear they are only for the invited.  A street lantern is here.

Set within a wide tunnel leading through the hedge to the north is the Wilderness Gate. It separates the settled lands of Spur from the open plains to the south of the city. The plains stretch as far as the eyes can see, the horizon and the walls of the fort down the road the only blemishes of the grassy landscape in the distance. The stones of the road are smoothly set together, well built to withstand heavy travel. A broken wagon wheel, discarded some time ago, covers a spot of nearby grass, weeds trying to climb through the spokes.  An open bronze gate is here.

[Southern Tradeway.]

The tradeway runs across the open grasslands northeast towards the Spur, and southwest towards distant lands and eventually, the coast. The plains to the south and east seem totally indifferent to your existence. Just ahead, a small path moves up a village of huts spread out in a semi-circle. In the center of the village a giant fire pit sits where barbarians who wander through the village can sit around to stay warm.  A worn grassy path is here.

Set within a wide tunnel leading through the hedge to the north is the Wilderness Gate. It separates the settled lands of Spur from the open plains to the south of the city. The plains stretch as far as the eyes can see, the horizon and the walls of the fort down the road the only blemishes of the grassy landscape in the distance. The stones of the road are smoothly set together, well built to withstand heavy travel. A broken wagon wheel, discarded some time ago, covers a spot of nearby grass, weeds trying to climb through the spokes.  An open bronze gate is here.

Through the gate lies the city of Spur, the major center of trade and civilization on the plains. The dusty road leading through the gates is well traveled, and walls of the city are in good repair. A small shack sits to the west of the road, during most times of the day a dusty coach can be seen waiting in front, its horses stomping with impatience to be gone. To the right of the door is a small window, its opening covered with metal bars. An old man, missing most of his teeth, waits patiently for the travelers to pay their fare, and then directs them into the waiting area. On the east side of the road a billowing multicolored tent has been erected, the hustle and bustle of merchants and customers can be seen coming and going at all times of the day.  An open iron gate and a rainbow silk tent are here.

The occasional locked gate marks the entrance to some of the more hidden estates of Spurs nobility. From this broad avenue, little can be seen of their splendor. Behind the imposing gate recedes a proud drive, disappearing mysteriously into the trees. If not for the large imposing tower rising above the hedges it would be hard to discern anything was beyond the gate. It is apparent the residents do not wish to be disturbed.

Leaving the exceptionally wealthy estates of the Spurian nobility, Noble Way heads toward the Town Square to the northwest.

Set in the marble base is a small plaque that reads, "For those who have gone before us." Many stand for a moment as they pass this way, giving thanks for the gift of life that is given by both the apple tree and the Secians of long ago. Large piles of dirt and broken stone lay on either side of the street as workmen ready the east and west alleys for expansion.

A grate in the ground loosens mud from wagon wheels and hooves before they pass through the gate, helping to keep the streets of Spur fairly clean.

A rickety criss-crossed rough beam fence pens the grazing of black and white cows whose ponderous forms are barely visible through the tall grass on either side of the road. To the north, the soft, undulating grassland floor of the wide valley succumbs to the rolling foothills, which in turn delineates the imposing outline of a vista-spanning mountain range. Many a traveler has witnessed this idyllic vantage point and has been drawn on to follow the road that travels into the heart of the mountains.

The road diverts around a small pool of murky water that lies to the north. A confusion of hoof prints muddies the shoreline where the placid bovines have come to water themselves. The pool is damned by a small hillock which allows no drainage so the pool remains stagnant. The mountains to the north reflect in perfectly upside-down symmetry on the still pond's surface, only wavering slightly in concentric circles to the deft touch of small insects.

The travel-worn road dips and curves around the low lying foothills. Each pass over the top of hillsides presents a new view of the mountain range. Each dip into small valleys reveal minute eco-systems that exist in each wagon wheel rut where water collects. Splayed avion tracks dot the dried mud in random order permanently recording the hunters conquest of lesser things from the mud and moss.

Aged and splintered into the vague circular shape, a decaying wagon wheel is left to rot in the grass by the roadside. Their roots protectively sheltered from the weather, idiosyntric sprouts of taller grasses thrive haphazardly inside the wheel. Several tiny holes top small pyramids of sandy debris, where a few red fire ants scout their wagon-wheel domain for fodder.

As the road bends around a curve, ruts left by merchant's wagons cut so deeply into the mud that all wheeled vehicles are forced to follow the set path. Four loaded wagons of a merchants caravan stand idle as one larger than standard wagon skitters along the path. The buckboard's frame groans and strains to keep it inline while the driver attempts to negotiate the turn. Four dark maned, matched mules balk at the noise behind them, and stomp nervously over the deep ruts. The liveried caravan guards attempt to haul the mules forward, further adding to the mules stubborn refusal to move.

The road charges across a flat valley through waving stalks of grain with coppery tinted seeds. Around the northern edge grows a row of huge cypress trees with trunks that measure eight feet across. Debris from the trees' self-trimming mats the taller grasses into an impenetrable wall. The cypresses produce the necessary windbreak for the field to bear the heavy headed grain.

The worn merchants road travels the southern side of a low hill in one wide arc. The broad path is slightly banked to accomodate for the turn and incline. On the exposed side of the road, the sturdy road-bed is exposed to the elements and yet has remained solid. A neatly kept plank house with a stone well and fenced paddock overlooks grain fields to the southeast.

Broadening to fill the lee of a wide valley, the roadway passes by several temporary campsites where caravans have bolstered the existing comforts for their temporary encampments. Neat stacks of foraged sticks and axe-hewn firewood sit adjacent to the blackened rocks of two impromptu fire rings. Freshly dug midden pits waft clues to the camp's frequent use into the clean mountain air.

Empty wooden crates, broken harnesses, damaged pottery, and the usual byproducts of food preparation fill an impromptu refuse pile adjacent to two campsites. Both two and four legged scavengers ply through the pile, scattering it further and enlarging the boundary. The result is a landmark of incongruous shapes, colors and shadows along the otherwise bland sweep of grasslands through which the roadway travels.

Just to the north, the roadway curves gently around a bend in a large river that flows towards the southeast. An enormous smooth round rock splits off a small eddy from the main current resulting a deep, clear pool by the eastern side of the road. The cool calm water catches the reflection of the white snowcapped mountain range further up the valley while the river rushes past towards Spur. Five fishermen recline on folding chairs or against rocks, tethered by the silvery lines of their poles to the fishing hole. Each fisherman is spread evenly around the pool as if held apart by some invisible barrier as they eye the large shadowy fish shapes finning effortlessly against the mild current in the eddy.

The raging silver-cast river cuts through the grassland and heads southeast. Fishing boats, bearing the crest of the city of Spur, dart around several barges laden with exotic wares to trade in the merchant city. Most bear the purple livery of the city of Rathan, but every so often a ship flying unfamiliar colors can be sighted.

The metal grey river deposits a sandbar on its western bank near the merchant road, causing a snag of dead logs, branches and floating debris. A cat sized rodent, with long teeth, flat tail and webbed toes peaks briefly over the jumbled tangle of branches before dipping back into the frigid water without a splash.

The massive stone bridge expands over the raging river, it's huge pilons buried deep in the river's bottom. Within sight and just downstream, the water rushes past what remains of the old bridge, causing dangerous under-currents. Bright red bouys mark the broken fragments locations and signs tell of the peril. The river pilots earn their pay negotiating this treacherous obstacle.

The huge stone bridge span was built tall to allow the various merchant ships to pass underneath. This amazing height affords a splendid view of the countryside: from the blur of smoky residential air to the southeast, across the verdant grasslands that cover the foothills, to the majestic peaks of the mountain range to the north.

The river surges strongly below the stone span. Even from this height, the noise of the flowing water is near deafening. Two small fishing boats nearly collide as they try to tack between the same set of supports. Only skillful sailing prevents them from hitting each other, or the supports.

Mismatched mortar colors and varying types and cuts of the stone show the extent of the reconstruction made by quick working masons. A few proud workers chiseled their initials and the date into their handiwork, most reading the date of Rinannimas, 6th month, 61st day, year 313. Bright banners flutter in the breeze on both sides of the bridge as if in celebration of its victory over both the river's truculence and sabotage.

A massive stone bridge spans a raging grey tinted river as it runs it's course towards the southeast. The mud around the bridge footings has been churned by wheels of quarry wagons, tracks of sleds bearing block and tackle, shod hooves of draft beasts and booted feet of masons and bridge workers. The newer parts of the huge bridge are obvious due to the contrast in colors of mortar and rock. Bright banners snap briskly in the wind from both ends of the bridge.  A broken wooden wagon is here.

Withstanding seasonal floods and constant traffic, the durable road shows how affective good design and competent construction can be. It travels a hand paved berm straight to an imposing grey stone bridge to the southeast. The pilons of the bridge are cloaked in river mist as the raging river sweeps by. Only the brightness of the fluttering flags that top the spans stand out sharply.

A brown and white osprey soars above the raging river, scanning the water for a meal. Suddenly, it dives down to the surface and snatches a rather large trout from the water. The trout wriggles helplessly in the large birds grip as it is carried off to a nest of sticks and twigs high in the distant treetops.

On the northern edge of the road stands a tall, flat rock. Chipped into the shape of a pillar and abraded to smoothness, it bears the stamped surveyor's mark of the road's builder. The mark's grooved letters are filled with sand and dust and obscured from age, but the arrows delineating north, south, east and west are clear and easy to read. The rest of the stamp is undecipherable and lends mystery to the road's origin.

Boulders stacked in pyramids contained by large timbers stand mutely to the side of the roadway next to an impromptu dump of broken tools, wooden stakes and empty buckets lined with mortar. Deeply grooved sled tracks lead to the east towards the bridge from this part of the road where the flatness of the valley was best suited for the staging area during the bridge's reconstruction. Smooth rectangles of tent foundations still mark their location in a semi circle around a blackened fire ring where the workers and their supervisors lived during it's rebuilding.

The decaying remains of the bridge workers camp sprawls across this flat valley. To house their draft beasts, the workers constructed small stalls and shelters from rickety boards nailed quixotically to the standing trees. Three brass ring topped posts lie sunk into the grasslands turf, to the south, which was most likely used for tethering grazing animals. Between the posts is a rough stone trough that is filled automatically with water by a rickety mechanical wind mill, whirling lazily in the breeze.

Water loving trees hug the river's course through the low lying valley. Giant beech and huge alders vie for the valuable sodden shoreline and shade the understory bushes and ferns from direct sunlight. The result is a lushly green, verdant forest that obscures the river from the view on the road, though the hiss of rushing water reveals it's course.

Running parallel to the road is a smooth rock lined trench that channels the road's run-off during rainstorms. This flat part of the road that follows the valley floor would be prone to turn into a muddy bog and therefore a hazard to most caravans and their pack animals. Anticipating this event, the road's engineers built drains into the lower side of the road that carry the runoff into the culvert, which carries it harmlessly down to the low end of the valley.

White barked birch trees populate the moist valleys that drain into the river to the southeast as the merchant road passes nearby. The tall vertical trees reach to the sky in a beautiful dance reminiscent of dancers waving their arms gracefully to some unheard rhythm.

The roadway takes advantage of a cut in the hill to negotiate a tumbled cliff face. At the top of the hill is a high, flat, steppe grassland, and at the bottom is the edge of the open range. At one point, the road narrows to cross a small stream. Very little mud gathers in the shallows of the stream and the pebbles and rocks glitter like gold as the wagon wheels churn the gravel.

The merchant roads widens as it travels another grass swept plateau. The mountain range fills the northern skyline in stark detail.

The grassland plateau is embraced by a stand of dark green oak trees so thick that little light passes through the profusion of their many lobed leaves. The forest is ancient and the trunks of the trees bare witness to fires, lightning strikes and the attacks of insects. Large gout-like burls disfigure some of the wide, grey trunks which have grown quietly next to the road for hundreds of years.

The merchant road makes a wide turn as it passes through the thick oak forest. A tiny meadow with a murmuring creek is the only open spot in sight.

The merchant road follows a bumpy path through the oak forest. Each stately old tree has added a few feet to it's girth since the road was first surveyed and constructed hundreds of years ago. Their roots have plied across the road, upending it's hand laid foundation and hand pounded bed. Several large knees of the oak's roots have leveraged up the edges of the road, hindering all wagons' passage and threatening to break spokes and axles.

Off to the side of the road, perhaps a hundred feet away, stands an enormous tree that commands the attention of all who pass this direction. It's offspring populate the plateau for miles in both directions.

The high steppe grasslands yields to a green wall of oak trees to the southeast. The oak forest is very old, the greying trunks of the behemoths are cracked and split.

Flat, yellow capped mushrooms and rippled shelf fungi sprout from the fallen trees. The pleasant aroma of healthy decomposing leaves fills the air.

>[Twin Creek Falls.]

Sparkling like sun kissed crystal, drops from the twin creeks cascades down the shorn granite face and fill a limpid blue pool lined with dark mosses and black rocks. Near the base of the waterfall, a large boulder has been weathered down to the shape of a rough block. A bowl-shaped depression within the rock holds fresh flowers and small, pretty, water-rounded pebbles, apparently left in offering to the Spirit of the Falls. A small green soapstone carving of a large bellied female is set knee deep in the chilly water.  Some faintly carved stone steps are here.

[Twin Creeks Crossing.]

Hand pounded concrete pipes, half circle in shape, channel two small streams under the chinked rock and gravel road-bed. The icy spring water bubbles down the hill and glides over a sheet of shorn granite until it fills a crystal clear pool at the bottom, far below the road. The pool's overflow creates a single clear stream that meanders towards the ancient oak forest.

To the southeast, two streams trickle from the north and pass directly under the roadbed. The twin streams combine as they travel down the hill to make a picture-perfect waterfall rimmed by delicate maidenhair ferns and bright green moss. The little riverlet from the pool then flows into an ancient oak forest further southeast.

The merchant road swerves around a rock strewn hill. Several ancient oak trees grow in solitary wonder on the south side of the hill. Dead fall and broken branches cover the hollow and is home for a family of thick furred marmots. The dark brown colored rodents stare out of the dark recesses of the dead branches with shiny black eyes. A brace of buck-toothed, adolescent marmots scramble for cover as the shrill cry of a hawk sounds further up the mountain.

Thicker stalked grasses grow here on this high plateau where the air is rarified and rain spills quickly down the small rocky gullies. A few staunch oaks grow alone or in groups of one or two, their roots exposed where they cling to the rocky soil for sustenance. Thin, scraggly junipers suck up what little moisture the soil does manage to hold. The merchant road placidly passes by, untouched by time in the dry environment.

Bright green trees and healthy bushes stand out sporadically on the dusty steppe. The little spring fed islands are surrounded by the blue-green grasses that thrive here. All manner of beasts are drawn to the springs and the protection they offer. Bright blue scrub jays chatter noisily among themselves as they dart and swerve in accomplished aerial feats pursuing their winged insect meals. A small herd of wary jackrabbits stop munching the grass to turn their white ears towards the merchant road. The nearest jack to the road stands on his hind legs and tests the air for any scent of their many predators.

Blending perfectly with the muted hues of the arid surroundings, a lone timber wolf stalks the outer edges of the grassland about a half a mile from the merchant road. The wolf's ears are perked to listen for the rustling of the bushy tailed jack rabbits that thrive in the prairie. The wolf lifts it nose to catch a scent, howls briefly and trots off towards the southeast to catch it's prey from downwind.

Game trails cut back and forth across the merchants road covered with the split, sharp toed hoof prints of deer and elk. Dark spoor mark the trails most frequently used by the herbivores: the hunted. Sharp yipping pierces the cold, quiet air from both sides of the road: the hunters. The widely spaced junipers, scrub oaks, and mountain hawthorns offer ample cover for the pack of wolves to range unseen through the plateau.

A brisk wind barrels down from the mountains to the north, its touch filled with the promise of ice and snow. As it passes the dry road-bed, it mixes with the warm moist air of the river valley that creeps north and causes dust dervishes that spin their opaque bodies thousands of feet into the air. The sharp bladed grasses shiver and swirl as the tiny twisters weave their way across the steppe.

The merchant road tops a low swell in the dusty green grass ocean of the dry steppe. From here, it is possible to observe an astounding 360 degree vista of the towering mountains to the north, the thick oak forest to the southeast, and more dry grasslands to the south and west. The terrain buckles and bends towards the north like a giant rug of trees and rocks had been pushed towards a wall of solid rock.

The merchant road takes a turn around a large, scraggy rock formation. To the northeast, the tall hills provide an ample wind break and here a small pine forest thrives.  A moss-banked stream meanders slowly down the center of the small hidden vale. To the south, the road tops a the long hill to a particularly good vantage point.

Tall, rough barked pine trees dominate the canyon floor as far as the eye can see. The vaulting slender trees compete for the sunlight high above the forest floor, leaving great visibility throughout the valley. At the south end of the hidden vale, the slow stream runs muddy as it snakes and loops around some of the older trees. Towards the north is an unnatural grouping of low lying mud domes.

Under the canopy of the tall pine forest, a few small scrub bushes grow where light has managed to penetrate the thin branches of the pine trees.  Low growing leather ferns cover the soft forest floor amidst the thick layer of pine needle mulch.  To the northeast, low mounds of dull orange mud and rocks circle a clearing in the trees.

Just west of the merchant road, a semi-circle of low domed mud hovels follow a large bend in the stream.  The sluggish stream fills the large, quiet pool that has accumulated behind a gentle cataract of rocks. Nothing disturbs the silken waters surface but a few fish seeking their insect meals.

Resembling mud hovels, haphazardly stacked balls of ochre mud surround the quiet, deep pool. The mud 'homes' are evenly spaced with great care and strange secretions surround the far sides.  Several large, flat stones half-submerged in the water cross the shallow end of the pool, each marked with the recent drippings and wet footprints of a large beast with long toes and sharp claws.

A sharp splash in the calm pool sends ripples down the stream and echoes off the narrow valley's walls.  The soft shush of slithering scales brushing against bushes and trees warns of an impending confrontation with the villages inhabitants. Three large male lizardmen duck out of one of the mud hovels doorway and sprint into hiding.

The merchant road follows the wandering path of the small stream. Towering pine trees grow thickly in this hidden forest.  Delicate, ground hugging ferns, thorny brambles with glossy leaves, and mountain laurels grow densely along the vale in the light shade of the pines. Bright green mosses cover the stream bank as the sluggish water ebbs to the southeast.

The merchant road follows the path of least resistance through the broken, rocky, higher foothills.  What is a well engineered road in the tamer steppe-lands becomes a minor miracle through the rougher hills and valleys. The road bed remains flat and easy to travel despite the rocky terrain. Each incline and decline in the road is fixed to an agreeable grade for most wagons and sleds.

The north end of a hidden pine tree forest abutts a stone outcropping. This small box ended canyon shelters the verdant green trees and a small sluggish stream as if protecting them from the broken backbones of bedrock and undulating dirt and rocks strewn to the north.  A closed slender spidersilk pouch is here.

The merchant road follows the path of least resistance through the broken, rocky, higher foothills.  What is a well engineered road in the tamer steppe-lands becomes a minor miracle through the rougher hills and valleys. The road bed remains flat and easy to travel despite the rocky terrain. Each incline and decline in the road is fixed to an agreeable grade for most wagons and sleds.

The merchant road follows the wandering path of the small stream. Towering pine trees grow thickly in this hidden forest.  Delicate, ground hugging ferns, thorny brambles with glossy leaves, and mountain laurels grow densely along the vale in the light shade of the pines. Bright green mosses cover the stream bank as the sluggish water ebbs to the southeast.

It looks like a large troll.

It looks like a tall, green humanoid looking creature with a terribly un-intelligent look in its eyes and a horrible stench surrounding its dirty body.
It has a head, 2 arms, 2 legs.

It appears to be hurt.
It is bleeding.
It will be very hard for you to hit and it will be not too hard for it to hit you!

It is also carrying the following item:

  A closed flowery leopardskin sack

Resembling mud hovels, haphazardly stacked balls of ochre mud surround the quiet, deep pool. The mud 'homes' are evenly spaced with great care and strange secretions surround the far sides.

Under the canopy of the tall pine forest, a few small scrub bushes grow where light has managed to penetrate the thin branches of the pine trees.  Low growing leather ferns cover the soft forest floor amidst the thick layer of pine needle mulch.  To the northeast, low mounds of dull orange mud and rocks circle a clearing in the trees.

Tall, rough barked pine trees dominate the canyon floor as far as the eye can see. The vaulting slender trees compete for the sunlight high above the forest floor, leaving great visibility throughout the valley. At the south end of the hidden vale, the slow stream runs muddy as it snakes and loops around some of the older trees. Towards the north is an unnatural grouping of low lying mud domes.

The merchant road takes a turn around a large, scraggy rock formation. To the northeast, the tall hills provide an ample wind break and here a small pine forest thrives.  A moss-banked stream meanders slowly down the center of the small hidden vale. To the south, the road tops a the long hill to a particularly good vantage point.

The merchant road tops a low swell in the dusty green grass ocean of the dry steppe. From here, it is possible to observe an astounding 360 degree vista of the towering mountains to the north, the thick oak forest to the southeast, and more dry grasslands to the south and west. The terrain buckles and bends towards the north like a giant rug of trees and rocks had been pushed towards a wall of solid rock.

The merchant road tops a low swell in the dusty green grass ocean of the dry steppe. From here, it is possible to observe an astounding 360 degree vista of the towering mountains to the north, the thick oak forest to the southeast, and more dry grasslands to the south and west. The terrain buckles and bends towards the north like a giant rug of trees and rocks had been pushed towards a wall of solid rock.

This area is not illuminated.
You see the 1st lizardman corpse and the 2nd lizardman.
In the area is Dash the Leuian.

The merchant road tops a low swell in the dusty green grass ocean of the dry steppe. From here, it is possible to observe an astounding 360 degree vista of the towering mountains to the north, the thick oak forest to the southeast, and more dry grasslands to the south and west. The terrain buckles and bends towards the north like a giant rug of trees and rocks had been pushed towards a wall of solid rock.

The merchant road tops a low swell in the dusty green grass ocean of the dry steppe. From here, it is possible to observe an astounding 360 degree vista of the towering mountains to the north, the thick oak forest to the southeast, and more dry grasslands to the south and west. The terrain buckles and bends towards the north like a giant rug of trees and rocks had been pushed towards a wall of solid rock.  A white wax candle and a closed discolored canvas bag are here.

This area is not illuminated.
You see the 1st lizardman corpse and the 1st troll.
In the area is Dash the Leuian.

The merchant road tops a low swell in the dusty green grass ocean of the dry steppe. From here, it is possible to observe an astounding 360 degree vista of the towering mountains to the north, the thick oak forest to the southeast, and more dry grasslands to the south and west. The terrain buckles and bends towards the north like a giant rug of trees and rocks had been pushed towards a wall of solid rock.  Some light panther skin are here.

A brisk wind barrels down from the mountains to the north, its touch filled with the promise of ice and snow. As it passes the dry road-bed, it mixes with the warm moist air of the river valley that creeps north and causes dust dervishes that spin their opaque bodies thousands of feet into the air. The sharp bladed grasses shiver and swirl as the tiny twisters weave their way across the steppe.

Game trails cut back and forth across the merchants road covered with the split, sharp toed hoof prints of deer and elk. Dark spoor mark the trails most frequently used by the herbivores: the hunted. Sharp yipping pierces the cold, quiet air from both sides of the road: the hunters. The widely spaced junipers, scrub oaks, and mountain hawthorns offer ample cover for the pack of wolves to range unseen through the plateau.

Blending perfectly with the muted hues of the arid surroundings, a lone timber wolf stalks the outer edges of the grassland about a half a mile from the merchant road. The wolf's ears are perked to listen for the rustling of the bushy tailed jack rabbits that thrive in the prairie. The wolf lifts it nose to catch a scent, howls briefly and trots off towards the southeast to catch it's prey from downwind.

Bright green trees and healthy bushes stand out sporadically on the dusty steppe. The little spring fed islands are surrounded by the blue-green grasses that thrive here. All manner of beasts are drawn to the springs and the protection they offer. Bright blue scrub jays chatter noisily among themselves as they dart and swerve in accomplished aerial feats pursuing their winged insect meals. A small herd of wary jackrabbits stop munching the grass to turn their white ears towards the merchant road. The nearest jack to the road stands on his hind legs and tests the air for any scent of their many predators.

Thicker stalked grasses grow here on this high plateau where the air is rarified and rain spills quickly down the small rocky gullies. A few staunch oaks grow alone or in groups of one or two, their roots exposed where they cling to the rocky soil for sustenance. Thin, scraggly junipers suck up what little moisture the soil does manage to hold. The merchant road placidly passes by, untouched by time in the dry environment.

The merchant road swerves around a rock strewn hill. Several ancient oak trees grow in solitary wonder on the south side of the hill. Dead fall and broken branches cover the hollow and is home for a family of thick furred marmots. The dark brown colored rodents stare out of the dark recesses of the dead branches with shiny black eyes. A brace of buck-toothed, adolescent marmots scramble for cover as the shrill cry of a hawk sounds further up the mountain.

To the southeast, two streams trickle from the north and pass directly under the roadbed. The twin streams combine as they travel down the hill to make a picture-perfect waterfall rimmed by delicate maidenhair ferns and bright green moss. The little riverlet from the pool then flows into an ancient oak forest further southeast.

Hand pounded concrete pipes, half circle in shape, channel two small streams under the chinked rock and gravel road-bed. The icy spring water bubbles down the hill and glides over a sheet of shorn granite until it fills a crystal clear pool at the bottom, far below the road. The pool's overflow creates a single clear stream that meanders towards the ancient oak forest.

The high steppe grasslands yields to a green wall of oak trees to the southeast. The oak forest is very old, the greying trunks of the behemoths are cracked and split. The road immediately darkens under the canopy of the green leaves. Pale green bracken ferns grow tall in the eternal twilight shade. Flat, yellow capped mushrooms and rippled shelf fungi sprout from the fallen trees. The pleasant aroma of healthy decomposing leaves fills the air.

The merchant road takes a large bend as it travels through the dark woodland. Venerable, wide-trunked oaks line the merchant road and the trunks of the closest ones have been marked by the passage of thousands of travelers and adventurers. Some have carved their initials, some, a picture of loved ones or body parts of odd proportions, and some, the date they passed by.

The merchant road follows a bumpy path through the oak forest. Each stately old tree has added a few feet to it's girth since the road was first surveyed and constructed hundreds of years ago. Their roots have plied across the road, upending it's hand laid foundation and hand pounded bed. Several large knees of the oak's roots have leveraged up the edges of the road, hindering all wagons' passage and threatening to break spokes and axles.

Quick footed grey squirrels dash across the road, or above on the high intertwined branches of the stately oaks, with the highly coveted acorns grasped firmly in their teeth. The squirrels flash their tails at each other in some unknown signal as traffic passes on the road.  A pile of empty acorn caps is here.

The forest is ancient and the trunks of the trees bare witness to fires, lightning strikes and the attacks of insects.

Huge snow capped peaks and rough faced cliffs are close enough to see the individual boulders, waterfalls, and haphazard game trails.

The roadway takes advantage of a cut in the hill to negotiate a tumbled cliff face. At the top of the hill is a high, flat, steppe grassland, and at the bottom is the edge of the open range. At one point, the road narrows to cross a small stream. Very little mud gathers in the shallows of the stream and the pebbles and rocks glitter like gold as the wagon wheels churn the gravel.

Running parallel to the road is a smooth rock lined trench that channels the road's run-off during rainstorms. This flat part of the road that follows the valley floor would be prone to turn into a muddy bog and therefore a hazard to most caravans and their pack animals. Anticipating this event, the road's engineers built drains into the lower side of the road that carry the runoff into the culvert, which carries it harmlessly down to the low end of the valley.

Water loving trees hug the river's course through the low lying valley. Giant beech and huge alders vie for the valuable sodden shoreline and shade the understory bushes and ferns from direct sunlight. The result is a lushly green, verdant forest that obscures the river from the view on the road, though the hiss of rushing water reveals it's course.

The decaying remains of the bridge workers camp sprawls across this flat valley. To house their draft beasts, the workers constructed small stalls and shelters from rickety boards nailed quixotically to the standing trees. Three brass ring topped posts lie sunk into the grasslands turf, to the south, which was most likely used for tethering grazing animals. Between the posts is a rough stone trough that is filled automatically with water by a rickety mechanical wind mill, whirling lazily in the breeze.

Boulders stacked in pyramids contained by large timbers stand mutely to the side of the roadway next to an impromptu dump of broken tools, wooden stakes and empty buckets lined with mortar. Deeply grooved sled tracks lead to the east towards the bridge from this part of the road where the flatness of the valley was best suited for the staging area during the bridge's reconstruction. Smooth rectangles of tent foundations still mark their location in a semi circle around a blackened fire ring where the workers and their supervisors lived during it's rebuilding.

On the northern edge of the road stands a tall, flat rock. Chipped into the shape of a pillar and abraded to smoothness, it bears the stamped surveyor's mark of the road's builder. The mark's grooved letters are filled with sand and dust and obscured from age, but the arrows delineating north, south, east and west are clear and easy to read. The rest of the stamp is undecipherable and lends mystery to the road's origin.

A brown and white osprey soars above the raging river, scanning the water for a meal. Suddenly, it dives down to the surface and snatches a rather large trout from the water. The trout wriggles helplessly in the large birds grip as it is carried off to a nest of sticks and twigs high in the distant treetops.

Withstanding seasonal floods and constant traffic, the durable road shows how affective good design and competent construction can be. It travels a hand paved berm straight to an imposing grey stone bridge to the southeast. The pilons of the bridge are cloaked in river mist as the raging river sweeps by. Only the brightness of the fluttering flags that top the spans stand out sharply.

A massive stone bridge spans a raging grey tinted river as it runs it's course towards the southeast. The mud around the bridge footings has been churned by wheels of quarry wagons, tracks of sleds bearing block and tackle, shod hooves of draft beasts and booted feet of masons and bridge workers. The newer parts of the huge bridge are obvious due to the contrast in colors of mortar and rock. Bright banners snap briskly in the wind from both ends of the bridge.  A broken wooden wagon is here.

Mismatched mortar colors and varying types and cuts of the stone show the extent of the reconstruction made by quick working masons. A few proud workers chiseled their initials and the date into their handiwork, most reading the date of Rinannimas, 6th month, 61st day, year 313. Bright banners flutter in the breeze on both sides of the bridge as if in celebration of its victory over both the river's truculence and sabotage.

The river surges strongly below the stone span. Even from this height, the noise of the flowing water is near deafening. Two small fishing boats nearly collide as they try to tack between the same set of supports. Only skillful sailing prevents them from hitting each other, or the supports.

The huge stone bridge span was built tall to allow the various merchant ships to pass underneath. This amazing height affords a splendid view of the countryside: from the blur of smoky residential air to the southeast, across the verdant grasslands that cover the foothills, to the majestic peaks of the mountain range to the north.

The massive stone bridge expands over the raging river, it's huge pilons buried deep in the river's bottom. Within sight and just downstream, the water rushes past what remains of the old bridge, causing dangerous under-currents. Bright red bouys mark the broken fragments locations and signs tell of the peril. The river pilots earn their pay negotiating this treacherous obstacle.

The metal grey river deposits a sandbar on its western bank near the merchant road, causing a snag of dead logs, branches and floating debris.

The raging silver-cast river cuts through the grassland and heads southeast. Fishing boats, bearing the crest of the city of Spur, dart around several barges laden with exotic wares to trade in the merchant city. Most bear the purple livery of the city of Rathan, but every so often a ship flying unfamiliar colors can be sighted.

Just to the north, the roadway curves gently around a bend in a large river that flows towards the southeast. An enormous smooth round rock splits off a small eddy from the main current resulting a deep, clear pool by the eastern side of the road. The cool calm water catches the reflection of the white snowcapped mountain range further up the valley while the river rushes past towards Spur. Five fishermen recline on folding chairs or against rocks, tethered by the silvery lines of their poles to the fishing hole. Each fisherman is spread evenly around the pool as if held apart by some invisible barrier as they eye the large shadowy fish shapes finning effortlessly against the mild current in the eddy.

Empty wooden crates, broken harnesses, damaged pottery, and the usual byproducts of food preparation fill an impromptu refuse pile adjacent to two campsites. Both two and four legged scavengers ply through the pile, scattering it further and enlarging the boundary. The result is a landmark of incongruous shapes, colors and shadows along the otherwise bland sweep of grasslands through which the roadway travels.

Broadening to fill the lee of a wide valley, the roadway passes by several temporary campsites where caravans have bolstered the existing comforts for their temporary encampments. Neat stacks of foraged sticks and axe-hewn firewood sit adjacent to the blackened rocks of two impromptu fire rings. Freshly dug midden pits waft clues to the camp's frequent use into the clean mountain air.

The worn merchants road travels the southern side of a low hill in one wide arc. The broad path is slightly banked to accomodate for the turn and incline. On the exposed side of the road, the sturdy road-bed is exposed to the elements and yet has remained solid.

The road charges across a flat valley through waving stalks of grain with coppery tinted seeds. Around the northern edge grows a row of huge cypress trees with trunks that measure eight feet across. Debris from the trees' self-trimming mats the taller grasses into an impenetrable wall. The cypresses produce the necessary windbreak for the field to bear the heavy headed grain.

As the road bends around a curve, ruts left by merchant's wagons cut so deeply into the mud that all wheeled vehicles are forced to follow the set path. Four loaded wagons of a merchants caravan stand idle as one larger than standard wagon skitters along the path. The buckboard's frame groans and strains to keep it inline while the driver attempts to negotiate the turn. Four dark maned, matched mules balk at the noise behind them, and stomp nervously over the deep ruts. The liveried caravan guards attempt to haul the mules forward, further adding to the mules stubborn refusal to move.

Aged and splintered into the vague circular shape, a decaying wagon wheel is left to rot in the grass by the roadside. Their roots protectively sheltered from the weather, idiosyntric sprouts of taller grasses thrive haphazardly inside the wheel. Several tiny holes top small pyramids of sandy debris, where a few red fire ants scout their wagon-wheel domain for fodder.

Each dip into small valleys reveal minute eco-systems that exist in each wagon wheel rut where water collects.

The road diverts around a small pool of murky water that lies to the north. A confusion of hoof prints muddies the shoreline where the placid bovines have come to water themselves. The pool is damned by a small hillock which allows no drainage so the pool remains stagnant. The mountains to the north reflect in perfectly upside-down symmetry on the still pond's surface, only wavering slightly in concentric circles to the deft touch of small insects.

A rickety criss-crossed rough beam fence pens the grazing of black and white cows whose ponderous forms are barely visible through the tall grass on either side of the road. To the north, the soft, undulating grassland floor of the wide valley succumbs to the rolling foothills, which in turn delineates the imposing outline of a vista-spanning mountain range. Many a traveler has witnessed this idyllic vantage point and has been drawn on to follow the road that travels into the heart of the mountains.

From the west spans a dark green forest of Sycamore and Beech trees that soak in the moister parts of the lower river valley. The tall, shaded forest breaks like a green tinged wave upon the tranquil calm of the grasslands. The huge trees within are ancient, reaching hundreds of feet into the air. As if steaming from a great cauldron, a heavy ground fog seeps from deep within the forest carrying with it the fresh smell of decomposing green matter.

Travelers from Rathan to the northwest, and the Trade Route to the south, converge at Spur's west gate. Guards posted on the ground give those seeking to enter the city a cursory once-over. Their lack of interest shows that anyone approaching has already been observed from above for some time. A grate in the ground loosens mud from wagon wheels and hooves before they pass through the gate, helping to keep the streets of Spur fairly clean.
