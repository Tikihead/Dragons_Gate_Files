01/01:

  HAPPY NEW YEAR 2002!

07/20:

o THERE IS A MANDATORY CHARACTER UPDATE REQUIRED FOR THIS NEW VERSION.
  To do this, select option 2 from the game menu, and then U for update.
  (This is for the switch between how channeling vs spellcasting skills
   are implemented in game.  It should exchange the proper skills for you,
   depending on your class.)

o Overhaul of combat system. (See message boards for more information)
o Fixed bug that allowed strenthen and heal prayers with 0 favors
o Increased depart delay to 10 minutes (still 3 minutes for novices)
o Removed stat loss chance from death
o Changed Frontacian drain
o Lowered cost of favors
o Uses are now given for any successful treat / lay hands
o Channeling skill has been split into Channeling (laying hands) and
   Spellcasting (runemagick)
o Psi sleep has been removed
o Body armor values adjusted slightly
o Guild rankings reset

03/20:

o Corrected occasional crash bug in prayers

03/15:

o Corrected crash bug from in-temple raises
o Removed Focus Force damage cap
o Corrected fatigue gains from natural attacks

03/13:

  SECOND UPDATE
o Corrected creation bug that swapped bone/body size selection
o Corrected calculation of carry capacity during creation

  FIRST UPDATE
o Fixed bug that prevented display of the number of creatures summoned by
   a dying creature
o Fixed bug in turn undead that appeared to cause permanent
   immobilization
o Fixed bug that prevented ID Weapons from being trainable
o Fixed bug that let psionics restorative spell take psi over maximum
o Major changes to healing and prayer systems:
   - Can now treat/lay hands repeatedly
   - Success rates went up
   - Low level effects went up, high level went down
   - Low level delays dropped, high level delays raised
   - Lay hands target must be within touch range.
   - Prayer costs consistent across devotional levels
   - Certain little-used prayers removed
   - Prayer costs, delays and effects changed
o Focus Force delays and effects dropped
o Psi damage/healing effectiveness reduced
o Allow players to choose bone/body/height type at creation time
o New spell effects added
o Adjusted way natural attacks give fatigue points
   - Web and bite now give fatigue points
o Fixed description of Taath, Set and Elindale given during creation
o Added bone/body type, hair and eye color to character viewer
o Secians can now fan their wings
o Added new roleplay commands: BARE, GAZE, GNASH, SCOFF, and SKIP

01/22:

o Timed events (like clock chimes, etc.) should be working again now.
o We decided to move the DR adjustments from final DR to base DR.  This
  means that your body/bone/height will not affect DR gains from skills.
o Base DR for short/thin members of a race increased slightly.
o Lay hands has been adjusted slightly.  The delay has been increased a
  tad (drops every 5 levels instead of every 4 levels) and every success
  now earns a use.
o Some small adjustments have been made to the magick system in how small
  runes are used.
o Some missing updates to Oog-Ra strength and damage mod have gone in.  You
  should see a little extra damage and carry for them now.
o Everyone should now have 5 character slots.

01/04:

o Another potential 'MM' fix in the pipe... hopefully this will be the one.
o A few more minor DR mods.
o Arachnian web costs have been lowered a bit, although the duration of the
  webs have also been slightly lowered to reflect the reduced costs.

01/03:

o DGate was stable under the old debug code... the 'MM' crash bug seems to
  have returned with its removal.  We're still investigating the problem.
o DR changes adjusted a bit.  Ranges tightened a bit for the heavier/taller.
o Arachnian webs fixed such that web costs are now honored properly.
o A couple long overdue berserk changes in:
  o Berserk bonus now a constant percentage rather than a huge jump at low
    levels and and percentage boost at upper levels.
  o Berserk no longer affects use of missile or thrown weapons (including web)

01/02:

o DGate is stable again.  This update removes the extreme debug code that was
  slowing the game down.  Hopefully we have found all the operating system/
  compiler oddities that plagued our transfer.  We're still in beta for the
  time being, however.

o This version implements some needed changes in calculations based on bone/
  body/height variances.  This should help better balance the pros/cons of
  all range of selections in terms of body choices.  (i.e., smaller/ thinner
  folks will have a DR advantage over heavier/taller members of the same race,
  obese characters will be a bit slower, etc.)
o New gateway version supports the new port number required for connection to
  the game.  It also implements better checking for odd occurances like being
  shown messages from a previous connection when logging in, etc.

* HAPPY NEW YEAR EVERYONE! *
