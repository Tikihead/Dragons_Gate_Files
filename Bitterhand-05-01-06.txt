A row of torches lines each wall, each mounted in an ornately crafted iron holder. The walls are constructed of expertly chiseled slabs of reddish granite, all having been carved with scenes of Hithual battles of yore. Each slab is trimmed by gold-flecked black granite. The ceiling is beautifully painted with a panoramic view of a great battlefield with hundreds of finely detailed warriors. You hear a group of rowdy Hithuals shout in unison "ALE!"  A highly polished dark walnut bar, lined with tankards is before you, a row of barstools in front of it. A number of large rocks have also been placed around as seats for those who prefer the feel of a mine. A long-bearded Hithual grins at you from behind the bar awaiting your order.   A highly polished dark walnut bar, a banner above the bar, a sign on the bar, a pair of open silver forged swinging doors, an open gold-flecked black granite door, and some vomit are here.

[Southern Avenue & Gorey Street.]

The boughs of a large apple tree hang over the well tended avenue. Below the beautiful tree stands a small fountain. Atop the fountain is an intricately carved Secian who appears to be dancing with the water as it splashes around her. Set in the marble base is a small plaque that reads, "For those who have gone before us." Many stand for a moment as they pass this way, giving thanks for the gift of life that is given by both the apple tree and the Secians of long ago. Large piles of dirt and broken stone lay on either side of the street as workmen ready the east and west alleys for expansion.  A street lantern, an open Secian etched moonsilver door, a pair of open silver forged swinging doors, and a sign above the doors are here.

[Southern Avenue.]

Vast estates tower over the huge Spurian wall towards the south. The well-to-do who live in these homes idle away their days, enjoying the luxury of time. Standing next to a very empty lantern pole, a small Flerian child insists in a plaintive wail, that he had nothing to do with the missing lantern. The well-dressed guard that interrogates him keeps pointing at a small sack on the ground and its obvious contents.  An open small burlap sack, a street lantern, and a lantern are here.

The outward appearance of the people here seems a bit classier. Rich clothing and large coin purses are prevalent amongst the travelers. In fact, many of the folk heading into Town Square from the south are accompanied by large bodyguards to assure their safety. The well maintained road is lined with small brass lanterns, each swinging off an individual pole.  A street lantern is here.

[Town Square Center.]

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.  A marble statue of a Human, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a rosewood sign, a crisp gold lettered vellum notice, a flowing white marble fountain, and a shimmering marble statue of a Dragon are here.

[Town Square.]

Two elegant buildings, one to the north and one to the west, stand on either side of a quickly degrading road. Nattily dressed patrons of the two establishments hurry to their destination, not pausing for fear of being robbed, or worse. To the northwest the houses steadily become more decrepit. A dark pallor of smoky air hangs heavily over the area.  A street lantern is here.

[Trade Way, Intersection.]

The monotonous line of dull grey buildings separate, revealing a massive domed building. The front walls of the building are dominated by glass panels displaying the latest fashions from several of the stores inside.  A pair of women carrying several shopping bags spin through the glass revolving doors while two grumpy looking men drag behind them with even larger bags. A large banner over the revolving doors proudly displays the name, "The Galleria", for all to see.   A street lantern and an open gold trimmed revolving glass door are here.

The well-worn road is crowded with groups of adventuring souls on their way to barter, unlock, and bank their wages. A constant stream travels to the south, into a small but well-tended courtyard. The rest rush past, hoping to thwart those that cling to the shadows and ply their darker trades with nimble fingers.  A street lantern is here.

An Anthian plays softly on a strange looking stringed instrument, her melodic voice filling the air. Judging by her clothing, and the number of silvers at her feet, she makes a fine living practicing her craft. Guards direct traffic in this clogged intersection.

The wafting smell of flowers and trees float out from a well kept grey fence.  Old piles of rubble have been cleaned up and the glimpse of a sprawling park can be seen, having been planted in their stead. Beautiful and statuesque monuments dot the landscape through the gate, that remains locked, but has been festively decorated with a bright ribbon.  A street lantern, an open festive ribbon tied grey iron gate, and an ancient greying steelwood gate are here.

From the city gate to the west, Trade Way continues eastward towards the busy Merchant district, past Joyeusse's Shop. The air is thick with the scent of fresh flowers.

[Gateway.]

The relative safety inside Spur is a comfort to those returning from the fields and mountains. To those leaving, a massive wall of defense around the city lies ahead. Archer towers beside the gate overlook the wall, offering a painful welcome to would-be invaders. Several guards on foot patrol pass and disappear behind a thick, bluesteel banded steelwood door. Wall road stretches to the south, a wide passage between the city wall and several large buildings.  An open patched steelwood gate, an open thick stone door, a street lantern, and a fluffy white layer of snow are here.

[Spur Gateway.]

Travelers from Rathan to the northwest, and the Trade Route to the south, converge at Spur's west gate. Guards posted on the ground give those seeking to enter the city a cursory once-over. Their lack of interest shows that anyone approaching has already been observed from above for some time. A grate in the ground loosens mud from wagon wheels and hooves before they pass through the gate, helping to keep the streets of Spur fairly clean.  An open giant patched steelwood gate, a giant green oak tree, a small blue pool, a thick oak grate over the pool, a polished stone marker, and a fluffy white layer of snow are here.

The path is flanked by countless tall oaks, swaying peacefully in the wind. They do their best to hide the sky from view, making it hard to tell night from day at times. Littering the area are pieces of broken wagon, bits of human remains and dried splotches of blood. The remnants of a violent fight lie all around you, whomever used to belong to the wagon is no more than vulture food.  A bloody severed foot is here.

In the dusty distance, Spur's great wall demarks the southern end of this well-traveled merchant's road. Soaring majestically to the north stands the spiky pinnacles and snow topped peaks of an epic mountain range so immense that it separates lands, races, and cultures. Connecting the two is a merchant road built long ago.

The noise and sputum of the big city stains the south eastern horizon through the vague outline of old-growth oaks, maples and cedars. This well traveled road transverses the flat terrain shouldered by weeds and vines and, due to the proximity of the city, small paths continuously cut through the road from either side.

Lush grass grows up to the borders of a thick, dense forest that cloaks the hills to the west. The grasslands thin near the grove as the huge trees completely shade the ground, and are replaced by taller bushes and juniper trees. The contrast between the waving stalks on the flat vista and the dark leaves of almost vertical trees is striking.

From the west spans a dark green forest of Sycamore and Beech trees that soak in the moister parts of the lower river valley. The tall, shaded forest breaks like a green tinged wave upon the tranquil calm of the grasslands. The huge trees within are ancient, reaching hundreds of feet into the air. As if steaming from a great cauldron, a heavy ground fog seeps from deep within the forest carrying with it the fresh smell of decomposing green matter.

A rickety criss-crossed rough beam fence pens the grazing of black and white cows whose ponderous forms are barely visible through the tall grass on either side of the road. To the north, the soft, undulating grassland floor of the wide valley succumbs to the rolling foothills, which in turn delineates the imposing outline of a vista-spanning mountain range. Many a traveler has witnessed this idyllic vantage point and has been drawn on to follow the road that travels into the heart of the mountains.

The road diverts around a small pool of murky water that lies to the north. A confusion of hoof prints muddies the shoreline where the placid bovines have come to water themselves. The pool is damned by a small hillock which allows no drainage so the pool remains stagnant. The mountains to the north reflect in perfectly upside-down symmetry on the still pond's surface, only wavering slightly in concentric circles to the deft touch of small insects.

Just to the north, the roadway curves gently around a bend in a large river that flows towards the southeast. An enormous smooth round rock splits off a small eddy from the main current resulting a deep, clear pool by the eastern side of the road. The cool calm water catches the reflection of the white snowcapped mountain range further up the valley while the river rushes past towards Spur. Five fishermen recline on folding chairs or against rocks, tethered by the silvery lines of their poles to the fishing hole. Each fisherman is spread evenly around the pool as if held apart by some invisible barrier as they eye the large shadowy fish shapes finning effortlessly against the mild current in the eddy.

The raging silver-cast river cuts through the grassland and heads southeast. Fishing boats, bearing the crest of the city of Spur, dart around several barges laden with exotic wares to trade in the merchant city.

A massive stone bridge spans a raging grey tinted river as it runs it's course towards the southeast. The mud around the bridge footings has been churned by wheels of quarry wagons, tracks of sleds bearing block and tackle, shod hooves of draft beasts and booted feet of masons and bridge workers. The newer parts of the huge bridge are obvious due to the contrast in colors of mortar and rock. Bright banners snap briskly in the wind from both ends of the bridge.  A broken wooden wagon is here.

The decaying remains of the bridge workers camp sprawls across this flat valley. To house their draft beasts, the workers constructed small stalls and shelters from rickety boards nailed quixotically to the standing trees. Three brass ring topped posts lie sunk into the grasslands turf, to the south, which was most likely used for tethering grazing animals. Between the posts is a rough stone trough that is filled automatically with water by a rickety mechanical wind mill, whirling lazily in the breeze.

Giant beech and huge alders vie for the valuable sodden shoreline and shade the understory bushes and ferns from direct sunlight.

Just to the north, the roadway curves gently around a bend in a large river that flows towards the southeast. An enormous smooth round rock splits off a small eddy from the main current resulting a deep, clear pool by the eastern side of the road. The cool calm water catches the reflection of the white snowcapped mountain range further up the valley while the river rushes past towards Spur. Five fishermen recline on folding chairs or against rocks, tethered by the silvery lines of their poles to the fishing hole. Each fisherman is spread evenly around the pool as if held apart by some invisible barrier as they eye the large shadowy fish shapes finning effortlessly against the mild current in the eddy.

From the west spans a dark green forest of Sycamore and Beech trees that soak in the moister parts of the lower river valley. The tall, shaded forest breaks like a green tinged wave upon the tranquil calm of the grasslands. The huge trees within are ancient, reaching hundreds of feet into the air. As if steaming from a great cauldron, a heavy ground fog seeps from deep within the forest carrying with it the fresh smell of decomposing green matter.

Travelers from Rathan to the northwest, and the Trade Route to the south, converge at Spur's west gate. Guards posted on the ground give those seeking to enter the city a cursory once-over. Their lack of interest shows that anyone approaching has already been observed from above for some time. A grate in the ground loosens mud from wagon wheels and hooves before they pass through the gate, helping to keep the streets of Spur fairly clean.  An open giant patched steelwood gate, a giant green oak tree, a small blue pool, a thick oak grate over the pool, a polished stone marker, and a fluffy white layer of snow are here.

The relative safety inside Spur is a comfort to those returning from the fields and mountains. To those leaving, a massive wall of defense around the city lies ahead. Archer towers beside the gate overlook the wall, offering a painful welcome to would-be invaders. Several guards on foot patrol pass and disappear behind a thick, bluesteel banded steelwood door. Wall road stretches to the south, a wide passage between the city wall and several large buildings.

The path is flanked by countless tall oaks, swaying peacefully in the wind. They do their best to hide the sky from view, making it hard to tell night from day at times. Littering the area are pieces of broken wagon, bits of human remains and dried splotches of blood. The remnants of a violent fight lie all around you, whomever used to belong to the wagon is no more than vulture food.  A bloody severed foot is here.

In the dusty distance, Spur's great wall demarks the southern end of this well-traveled merchant's road. Soaring majestically to the north stands the spiky pinnacles and snow topped peaks of an epic mountain range so immense that it separates lands, races, and cultures. Connecting the two is a merchant road built long ago.

The noise and sputum of the big city stains the south eastern horizon through the vague outline of old-growth oaks, maples and cedars. This well traveled road transverses the flat terrain shouldered by weeds and vines and, due to the proximity of the city, small paths continuously cut through the road from either side.

Lush grass grows up to the borders of a thick, dense forest that cloaks the hills to the west. The grasslands thin near the grove as the huge trees completely shade the ground, and are replaced by taller bushes and juniper trees. The contrast between the waving stalks on the flat vista and the dark leaves of almost vertical trees is striking.

From the west spans a dark green forest of Sycamore and Beech trees that soak in the moister parts of the lower river valley. The tall, shaded forest breaks like a green tinged wave upon the tranquil calm of the grasslands. The huge trees within are ancient, reaching hundreds of feet into the air. As if steaming from a great cauldron, a heavy ground fog seeps from deep within the forest carrying with it the fresh smell of decomposing green matter.

A rickety criss-crossed rough beam fence pens the grazing of black and white cows whose ponderous forms are barely visible through the tall grass on either side of the road. To the north, the soft, undulating grassland floor of the wide valley succumbs to the rolling foothills, which in turn delineates the imposing outline of a vista-spanning mountain range. Many a traveler has witnessed this idyllic vantage point and has been drawn on to follow the road that travels into the heart of the mountains.

The road diverts around a small pool of murky water that lies to the north. A confusion of hoof prints muddies the shoreline where the placid bovines have come to water themselves. The pool is damned by a small hillock which allows no drainage so the pool remains stagnant. The mountains to the north reflect in perfectly upside-down symmetry on the still pond's surface, only wavering slightly in concentric circles to the deft touch of small insects.

Just to the north, the roadway curves gently around a bend in a large river that flows towards the southeast. An enormous smooth round rock splits off a small eddy from the main current resulting a deep, clear pool by the eastern side of the road. The cool calm water catches the reflection of the white snowcapped mountain range further up the valley while the river rushes past towards Spur. Five fishermen recline on folding chairs or against rocks, tethered by the silvery lines of their poles to the fishing hole. Each fisherman is spread evenly around the pool as if held apart by some invisible barrier as they eye the large shadowy fish shapes finning effortlessly against the mild current in the eddy.

Most bear the purple livery of the city of Rathan, but every so often a ship flying unfamiliar colors can be sighted.

Mismatched mortar colors and varying types and cuts of the stone show the extent of the reconstruction made by quick working masons. A few proud workers chiseled their initials and the date into their handiwork, most reading the date of Rinannimas, 6th month, 61st day, year 313. Bright banners flutter in the breeze on both sides of the bridge as if in celebration of its victory over both the river's truculence and sabotage.

The newer parts of the huge bridge are obvious due to the contrast in colors of mortar and rock. Bright banners snap briskly in the wind from both ends of the bridge.

A brown and white osprey soars above the raging river, scanning the water for a meal. Suddenly, it dives down to the surface and snatches a rather large trout from the water.

On the northern edge of the road stands a tall, flat rock. Chipped into the shape of a pillar and abraded to smoothness, it bears the stamped surveyor's mark of the road's builder.

The rest of the stamp is undecipherable and lends mystery to the road's origin.

Boulders stacked in pyramids contained by large timbers stand mutely to the side of the roadway next to an impromptu dump of broken tools, wooden stakes and empty buckets lined with mortar. Deeply grooved sled tracks lead to the east towards the bridge from this part of the road where the flatness of the valley was best suited for the staging area during the bridge's reconstruction. Smooth rectangles of tent foundations still mark their location in a semi circle around a blackened fire ring where the workers and their supervisors lived during it's rebuilding.

The decaying remains of the bridge workers camp sprawls across this flat valley. To house their draft beasts, the workers constructed small stalls and shelters from rickety boards nailed quixotically to the standing trees. Three brass ring topped posts lie sunk into the grasslands turf, to the south, which was most likely used for tethering grazing animals. Between the posts is a rough stone trough that is filled automatically with water by a rickety mechanical wind mill, whirling lazily in the breeze.

Water loving trees hug the river's course through the low lying valley. Giant beech and huge alders vie for the valuable sodden shoreline and shade the understory bushes and ferns from direct sunlight. The result is a lushly green, verdant forest that obscures the river from the view on the road, though the hiss of rushing water reveals it's course.

Running parallel to the road is a smooth rock lined trench that channels the road's run-off during rainstorms. This flat part of the road that follows the valley floor would be prone to turn into a muddy bog and therefore a hazard to most caravans and their pack animals. Anticipating this event, the road's engineers built drains into the lower side of the road that carry the runoff into the culvert, which carries it harmlessly down to the low end of the valley.

The merchant road threads through bottom of the small, narrow valley. Sheer granite walls block the view from the well traveled road to either side and above, only a narrow ray of sky testifies to the time of day. The engineers set a route as far as possible from the broken stones in the center of the valley and, by luck or design, this foresight has saved the road-bed from constant reconstruction. Small cracks run parallel to the road, but none have broken through the thick layers of sand and stone.

The old merchant road lies in pieces at the bottom of a deep gorge far below. An artificial pathway has been constructed in the wake of the recent collapse, allowing continued passage through the mountains. This new merchant road has been constructed in great haste and is still quite unstable. Gravel that has been spread on the road to make it safer, is actually making it far more precarious. Pebbles roll continuously off of the roads surface and down into the chasm below.

A lone carrion bird seems to stare from the branches of a gnarled old tree. The road surface alternates between the usual hard-packed dirt covered in gravel, and solid rock. The terrain creates even more difficult travel for those heading north or south. A large pile of broken wagons, barrels, and boxes lie quite some distance below. Many skeletons of pack animals, picked clean by carrion birds, are also discernible. It is highly likely some of the bones are Humanoid as well.

There is an extremely large crevasse in the roadway that would normally prevent any further travel along this road. Astoundingly, someone has constructed a very sturdy looking bridge using two perfectly chiseled granite blocks. The blocks make up the support for the bridge structure, which is also constructed of chiseled granite slabs. There is seemingly no explanation for the excellent condition of this stretch of the road.  A sturdy granite bridge is here.

The cliff face to the north is wet, but there is no apparent source of the moisture. A slight overhang also creates a near permanent shadow in the area, providing a perfect atmosphere for the dense lichen that covers the rocks. Sporadic tufts of grass futilely attempt to assert themselves against the multi-colored lichen, but the spongy fungus prevails. Strange looking spiders scurry about amongst the lichen-covered rocks, before disappearing over the top of the cliff.

The road is almost non-existent. The many large granite boulders that cover the path evidence the instability of the mountains to the north and south. The merchants who travel this road have erected a series of shoddy road signs to direct travelers safely around the boulders. Several of these signs point away from a shadowy area just off the side of the road. The rocks of the area seem to hang over the road slightly, blocking out the light. Light colored stringy material is barely visible along the side of the path.  A flimsy wooden sign, a flimsy wooden sign, a craggy overhang, and a slightly bloated merchant's corpse are here.

The merchant road ascends slightly to the east as it travels between two mountain peaks. Up the slopes to the north and south is a dense forest with massive red barked trees. Closer to the path, the forest begins to thin out and only a few trees have established themselves close to the road. The merchants who made this road did not bother to go around one of the largest, which is situated directly in the middle of the path.  An ancient towering rosewood tree is here.

The tranquil terrain has been torn asunder to the northwest. One of the forces of nature has caused a great fissure to open in the earth. Although the fissure slopes downward at a severe angle, the terrain is surprisingly smooth and could be navigated even by a goods-loaded wagon. To the east a great deal of grass is growing on the road itself. It almost seems as if no one has used that road in a while.

A large gap between two large hills to the north and west offers safe passage through this hilly terrain. A cold wind out of the northwest blows stiffly, whipping up the dust. The ground is so dry that most of the topsoil is easily pulled off by the strong winds. Large angry clouds of dust move back and forth throughout the area, wreaking havoc on the eyes and lungs of any that dare to pass through them.  A large thick cloud of dust is here.

There is quite a bit of debris on the road in that direction. A family of prairie dogs has dug a series of holes a few meters from the road. One is constantly on watch, attempting to keep the family safe from harm. At the slightest noise, it scurries back into its hole and out of sight.  An animal made hole is here.

It would seem this area is prone to landslides. A new road has been cut into the terrain to the southwest, heading in the direction of a smaller mountain peak.

A carpet of needles covers the path. Pine cones, larger then a Thugian fist, dot the ground. Enormous trees collide with large boulders blocking you from venturing too deep into the overgrown wood. The squawk of a large bird echoes from far overhead, but looking up to identify it would be futile, as it perches in branches hundreds of feet above your head.

Only the hardiest of life forms hold their own on the rocky steppes. Small cascades of icy water stream down the boulders and darken their surfaces. Tough lichen and scrub pines absorb nutrients from the mineral laden run-off. The sun shines brightly on the southern exposure of the trail, sheltered from the wind and freezing cold. Bright green oases of life sprout from rocky niches and the path is slippery where the green slimy growths cross it.

Huge boulders have created a bowl shaped depression in this sheltered hillock. A stand of scruffy trees continues to eke out a tenuous existence above the rocky outpost; their long tortured roots clinging desperately to what little soil is caught between the boulders. Prevailing winds from the mountaintop have caused the trunks to lean westward, the upper branches creating a canopy over the area.

Beneath the trees, many a caravan has stopped to water their draft animals and rest for the night. The area is strewn with animal refuse, bits of feed, and the resulting lingering aroma. The discarded feed and rubbish left by the travelers is picked over constantly by the hillock's inhabitants. In such a harsh environment, very little waste is left by the local scavengers.

A small spring fed stream meanders around the bowl, filling a pool on the western side of the path. A series of miniature waterfalls gurgle delightfully along the edges of the camp. The resulting pool is quite deep and crystal clear, even with the constant watering of pack animals. The flow of the spring must be constantly replenishing the pool, for no algae or slime clouds its depths.  A small crystal clear pool is here.

A lean-to built from odds and ends serves as a way station for exhausted travelers. Gathered firewood lines the lean-to's walls, and a small darkened pit smolders outside the opening. Inside the small, cramped lean-to, light filters in through the makeshift construction. The possibility of being snowed in and sheltering for a long period in this little hovel is not a welcome proposition.

While the tunnel is still well made and structurally sound, the air deep within is dank and moist.

Muted light from four large cathedral windows reflects on a finely polished grand piano. Neither wear nor dust mar its surface. Occasionally a single note breaks the eerie silence and the ivory keys glow with a mysterious light. Is it a reflection or something more sinister?  A polished black grand piano, an open striped doeskin pouch, and an open handmade leather pouch are here.

A small dirty window allows a minimal amount of light through its streaked panes. The drapes that adorn it have darkened with age, but appear to have originally been a stunning gold color. On either side of a small oak table sit two large black velvet, high-back chairs. They create a quiet corner to sit unnoticed and watch the activity of the parlor.  An open thick oak door is here.

A cream colored settee, embroidered with small black and gold roses, leans against the wall. A small, low slung table resides several feet in front of it.

Scattered on the floor is the rest of a very beautiful porcelain tea set, in various states of destruction.

Dirt streaked windows look out upon what was once a beautiful lawn. The morning sun shines into them, brightening the dining room each and every morning.

A finely crafted breakfront dominates this corner of the dining room. A sprinkling of glass litters its top, having fallen from one of the open doors above. Pieces of chipped porcelain line the shelves, all the finer pieces having disappeared or been broken. One drawer lies on the floor broken into small pieces and charred, as if someone thought to use it to start a small fire.

A large dining room table stands in the middle of the room covered by large dust throws. Intricately carved wooden legs peek out from beneath the blankets. A large chandelier, filled with the remnants of burned out candles, hangs above the table. On the floor a once beautiful black and red rug lies worn and faded, covered with a light coating of dust.

Eight high-back dining room chairs stand in disarray against a cream and gold papered wall. Their black linen seats are embroidered with the same color design as can be seen in the wall paper. Dust covers the intricate wood designs of their backs, and dims the once beautiful colors of their seats. Why they sit here, instead of being carefully covered as the table, remains a mystery.

Through the back wall a small pipe flows with a continuous stream of water, uninterrupted for many years, it quickly runs into a basin and disappears to parts unknown. Stacks of yellowing towels and linens fill the shelving against the eastern wall and what is left of some beautiful glass flagons sit below them on a low counter. A heavy wooden door on the floor can be lifted to reveal a deep cold well where at one time perishables were kept.  A short thin bronze throwing dagger, some light highly polished copper chainmail, a short carbide stake, and an open stained tigerskin bag are here.

[Servants' Entrance, Ari'kian Keep.]

Allowing the servants access from the kitchen and servants' quarters to all areas of the keep, this entrance has been carefully placed in the rear of the residence. Those who bring the food from the unattached kitchen, and those who maintain the keep, have access to the not only the first floor, but the basement and the upper sleeping quarters.  A stone staircase, an oak staircase, and an open wooden door are here.

This room is illuminated.
In the room are Oarblade the Noble Hithual, Moten the Noble Hithual, Haberthan the Noble Hithual, and Nicki the Noble Hithual.
Obvious exits: southeast* west*.

[Parlor, Ari'kian Keep.]

A cream colored settee, embroidered with small black and gold roses, leans against the wall. A small, low slung table resides several feet in front of it. On the table a piece of fine porcelain has been smashed into small non-distinguishable pieces. Scattered on the floor is the rest of a very beautiful porcelain tea set, in various states of destruction.

This area is illuminated.
In the area are Oarblade the Noble Hithual, Moten the Noble Hithual, Haberthan the Noble Hithual, and Nicki the Noble Hithual.

A small dirty window allows a minimal amount of light through its streaked panes. The drapes that adorn it have darkened with age, but appear to have originally been a stunning gold color. On either side of a small oak table sit two large black velvet, high-back chairs. They create a quiet corner to sit unnoticed and watch the activity of the parlor.  An open thick oak door is here.

As your eyes adjust to the natural darkness of the room, its rich opulence becomes apparent. Deep red carpet and matching draperies are offset by warm oak walls. Two brown velvet chairs sit against the western wall, an oak chest against the northern wall. The musky smell of books and dust weighs heavily in the air.  An open thick oak door is here.

A bookcase rises from the floor to the ceiling, dominating the eastern wall of the study. It is filled with very old books, their pages yellowed with age. Moving a volume will get you a mouthful of dust and in all probability a handful of disintegrating paper.  A large dusty oak bookcase is here.

A large oak desk dominates this corner of the study. The wooden chair that resides behind it looks as if it was well used during its time, the arms worn and the back curved from use. Several pictures remain hanging on the wall, a peculiar thing considering the state of the rest of the keep.  A picture and a picture are here.

A heavy wooden door on the floor can be lifted to reveal a deep cold well where at one time perishables were kept.

The stench of rot is overpowering in this room. You have found where the garbage was stored. Black mold has overrun the walls, floor and even the ceiling, slowly eating the remains of whatever was left here eons ago. Chipped pieces of porcelain poke at your feet, the only things that remain discernible in this garbage heap.  An open muddy hemp bag and an open worn calfhide pouch are here.

A large table dominates this room. Several tall stools sit around the table. In the center of the table is a hole with a large bucket below it. Stains spread across the table from the point of each stool to the hole in the center. Noting the abuse on the surface of the table it is fairly obvious that many potatoes, fruits and vegetables have been cleaned and prepared on this table.

Now cold and dusty, this room was once the hub of a very busy kitchen. Tables fill the room, each holding a various instrument needed to serve a large meal.

Through the back wall a small pipe flows with a continuous stream of water, uninterrupted for many years, it quickly runs into a basin and disappears to parts unknown. Stacks of yellowing towels and linens fill the shelving against the eastern wall and what is left of some beautiful glass flagons sit below them on a low counter. A heavy wooden door on the floor can be lifted to reveal a deep cold well where at one time perishables were kept.

Through the back wall a small pipe flows with a continuous stream of water, uninterrupted for many years, it quickly runs into a basin and disappears to parts unknown. Stacks of yellowing towels and linens fill the shelving against the eastern wall and what is left of some beautiful glass flagons sit below them on a low counter. A heavy wooden door on the floor can be lifted to reveal a deep cold well where at one time perishables were kept.

A large table dominates this room. Several tall stools sit around the table. In the center of the table is a hole with a large bucket below it. Stains spread across the table from the point of each stool to the hole in the center. Noting the abuse on the surface of the table it is fairly obvious that many potatoes, fruits and vegetables have been cleaned and prepared on this table.

[Kitchen, Ari'kian Keep.]

Now cold and dusty, this room was once the hub of a very busy kitchen. Tables fill the room, each holding a various instrument needed to serve a large meal. Trenchers wait at the ready on one table, utensils lie unused upon another table, and covered trays sit gathering dust upon yet another table.  A closed smoke stained door is here.

This room is illuminated.
In the room are Oarblade the Noble Hithual, Moten the Noble Hithual, Haberthan the Noble Hithual, and Nicki the Noble Hithual.

A small dirty window allows a minimal amount of light through its streaked panes. The drapes that adorn it have darkened with age, but appear to have originally been a stunning gold color. On either side of a small oak table sit two large black velvet, high-back chairs. They create a quiet corner to sit unnoticed and watch the activity of the parlor.  An open thick oak door is here.

Light filters in through a large paned glass window which, at one time must have glistened, but is now coated with the accumulation of years of dirt. A finely crafted staircase, its balustrade polished from many years of use, rises to the second floor unsupported.  A polished oak circular staircase and some open massive black obsidian double doors are here.

Stepping stones cut across what was once a large lawn. Their destination is the rather imposing manse to the north. Weeds have choked out any grass that may have at one time existed.

An incredibly large keep looms ominously above the perfectly groomed grounds, its windows dark. The gate is carved with strange, deeply etched symbols that seem to swirl and writhe.

A lavish garden stretches between a rocky cliff to the west and a dark keep to the east. The flowers and shrubbery are immaculate, but the landscape is strangely quiet and completely devoid of movement. The lively, vibrant colors of the blossoms contrast with the deathly stillness. A large tunnel descends into the depths of the cliff-face.

[Ari'kian Trail.]

Old rusted sconces stand sentry along both sides of this end of the giant tunnel.

The walls of the tunnel bear witness to the constant pressures of the tons of stone above. Water seeps through large fractures to a small pool. Small piles of rocks litter the floor and the air is heavy with moisture. Footsteps produce a crunching rhythm, out of sync with one's quickening heartbeat.

No exit is visible from this section of the tunnel, only a choice of east or west. A few hastily assembled wooden beams seem to support entire weight of the mountain.

While the tunnel is still well made and structurally sound, the air deep within is dank and moist. On closer inspection, hair-line fractures have appeared in the smoothly cut tunnel walls, allowing a few moist rivuletes to seep through onto the granite's surface. The walls are streaked dark from the constant flow of the cold, clear water.

The dark granite walls of the tunnel are so well engineered that no cracks have appeared, even after years of pressure from the mountain. The lack of telltale dust or sand fouling the perfect floor does little to take one's mind off the looming presence of millions of tons of rock above.

A sheltered hillock covered by scraggly trees is visible to the northeast. The trees shade a large pool, and a makeshift lean-to is visible in the clearing. The trail meanders southeast along the rim of a steep cliff. A symmetrical, well-crafted tunnel in the sheer rock face appears as the terminus of the trail.

A lean-to built from odds and ends serves as a way station for exhausted travelers. Gathered firewood lines the lean-to's walls, and a small darkened pit smolders outside the opening. Inside the small, cramped lean-to, light filters in through the makeshift construction. The possibility of being snowed in and sheltering for a long period in this little hovel is not a welcome proposition.

The boulders bear scars from deeply driven pinions and screws used to hold cables and reins, or perhaps impromptu corrals for the portage animals. The paths that enter and exit the haven are narrow and strewn with small but heavy rocks. Any wagons drawn this far would have to be manhandled over them using cables, levers, or wedges.

A small spring fed stream meanders around the bowl, filling a pool on the western side of the path. A series of miniature waterfalls gurgle delightfully along the edges of the camp. The resulting pool is quite deep and crystal clear, even with the constant watering of pack animals. The flow of the spring must be constantly replenishing the pool, for no algae or slime clouds its depths.  A small crystal clear pool is here.

Beneath the trees, many a caravan has stopped to water their draft animals and rest for the night. The area is strewn with animal refuse, bits of feed, and the resulting lingering aroma. The discarded feed and rubbish left by the travelers is picked over constantly by the hillock's inhabitants. In such a harsh environment, very little waste is left by the local scavengers.

Huge boulders have created a bowl shaped depression in this sheltered hillock. A stand of scruffy trees continues to eke out a tenuous existence above the rocky outpost; their long tortured roots clinging desperately to what little soil is caught between the boulders. Prevailing winds from the mountaintop have caused the trunks to lean westward, the upper branches creating a canopy over the area.

Only the hardiest of life forms hold their own on the rocky steppes. Small cascades of icy water stream down the boulders and darken their surfaces. Tough lichen and scrub pines absorb nutrients from the mineral laden run-off. The sun shines brightly on the southern exposure of the trail, sheltered from the wind and freezing cold. Bright green oases of life sprout from rocky niches and the path is slippery where the green slimy growths cross it.

You stand before a granite wall and large double gated doors. The walls are thick and finely crafted, and there seems to be a rather aged look about them.  The Gate is made of massive slabs of silver, while off to the left and right are the fort's impressive walls, able to withstand a rather large invasion or army if need be.  An open silver-trimmed black drathain gate is here.

Rough granite walls rise above you to the east and west. The area here is a bit rougher and seems to have been recently mined. Large veins of silver can be seen. Up overhead, on the western face of the gorge wall a large crack has appeared. Though large enough to fit a Thugian, the only thing exiting the crack is a steady stream of dripping water.

A wide rocky trail heads off into the mountainous terrain in an easterly direction. A large pile of rocks from an old landslide partially blocks passage in the other direction. Cracks and crevasses mar trail's surface, as runoff from the mountain snow makes its way to lower ground. Lush green bushes, and small trees dot the landscape, mingling with large boulders and smaller rocks.  A large pile of rocks is here.

A makeshift path has been created to circumvent the large tree that has fallen down and blocked the regular path. Lying on its side, the log stands two heads higher then the tallest Thugian.

Only the hardiest of life forms hold their own on the rocky steppes. Small cascades of icy water stream down the boulders and darken their surfaces. Tough lichen and scrub pines absorb nutrients from the mineral laden run-off. The sun shines brightly on the southern exposure of the trail, sheltered from the wind and freezing cold. Bright green oases of life sprout from rocky niches and the path is slippery where the green slimy growths cross it.

Huge boulders have created a bowl shaped depression in this sheltered hillock. A stand of scruffy trees continues to eke out a tenuous existence above the rocky outpost; their long tortured roots clinging desperately to what little soil is caught between the boulders. Prevailing winds from the mountaintop have caused the trunks to lean westward, the upper branches creating a canopy over the area.

Beneath the trees, many a caravan has stopped to water their draft animals and rest for the night. The area is strewn with animal refuse, bits of feed, and the resulting lingering aroma. The discarded feed and rubbish left by the travelers is picked over constantly by the hillock's inhabitants. In such a harsh environment, very little waste is left by the local scavengers.

[Third Floor, Ari'kian Keep.]

A beautiful black marble floor, accentuated by gold marbling throughout, continues to glisten through the light layer of dust that resides upon it. Against the gold papered walls stand two rather large smoke stained torcheries that have not been used for many years. A large black obsidian door graces the eastern wall.  An open large obsidian door is here.

Heading off the main hallway is a smaller, less elaborate, branch. The marble flooring continues both directions, but it is plain to see that while no expense was spared in the main hallway, the small western hallway is stark in comparison. Two gold brocade chairs rest against the eastern wall, a small oak table sits between them. Bumping up against either chair will get you a mouthful of choking dust.

The long dark hallway continues, dust stirring with your every movement. Several old paintings hang askew against the gold papered wall. Their formidable countenances stare back at you. Who they might be, and how they are related to this keep is a mystery, for none of them are Sanene, and this keep most certainly is.

Coming to the end of this long hallway, you find a large window. A small spot has been rubbed in its surface, clearing the glass of soot and dirt stains that have accumulated in over one-hundred years of neglect. Looking through the smudge you have a lovely view of the gardens. At one time this small alcove must have been a very quiet place to stand and view the comings and goings of the keep.

The minute appendages line the walls high and low, some still holding long iron pokers and malleable steel paddles, others serving as hooks for three-pronged barbed whips.  A cold spiraling stone staircase is here.

The thin yet distinct carving of a female Anthian standing sideways, her wings flared, forms the carved doors of a cabinet leaning against the cold stone wall. Opening the cherry construct requires for the bird-creature's wings to be pulled away from its body. This would explain the agony carved into her face.

A large velvet tapestry adorns the nearby wall. Though the plush material is torn and tattered in many places, the image of a regal looking San Elf can be made out.

The putrid odors of sweat, urine, and blood confront your sense of smell, threatening to overwhelm it, and each of your other senses. Cedar heartwood planks comprise the floor of the tower. Time and moisture have caused the wood to warp and crack, making your passage somewhat hazardous.  A cold spiraling stone staircase, an open large cobblestone door, a two-handed steel scythe, and an open patched bag are here.

The charred remains of a cherry wood cabinet stand in the dim light. Multicolored shards of glass line the doors and litter the base of the wooden display case. Undisturbed within are many different instruments of pain and torture: long pins, barbed needles, jagged slivers of bluesteel, studded flails, spiked collars, and coils of finely-linked moonsilver.

Small knobs adorn the wall on either side of the circular staircase. Upon further inspection, these knobs are actually small ebony hands, palms up and fingers slightly curved into a grasping position. The minute appendages line the walls high and low, some still holding long iron pokers and malleable steel paddles, others serving as hooks for three-pronged barbed whips.  A cold spiraling stone staircase is here.

A green veined marble chair occupies the center position in this portion of the tower. The armrests contain thick leather straps, obviously designed for holding the occupant of the chair in place securely, and sharp spikes where the wrists would rest. Similar restraints are found where the legs would be, and a larger leather binding hangs where a head would be positioned. Directly under the armrests hang rusted copper buckets.  A cold spiraling stone staircase is here.

Concentric circles of fire-blackened stone form an eerie pattern on the floor beneath a suspended platform. The platform, hanging haphazardly by pulleys from only two of its four corners, is crafted from loose sheets of ring mail. Each ring is large enough to allow your finger to pass through, as well as the searing heat of the fire. The ring mail still holds strands of hair and rotting scales.  A cold stone staircase is here.

Concentric circles of fire-blackened stone form an eerie pattern on the floor beneath a suspended platform. The platform, hanging haphazardly by pulleys from only two of its four corners, is crafted from loose sheets of ring mail.

A small onyx table stands propped against the cobblestone tower wall. Crimson wax remnants of a pillar candle adhere to the glinting midnight tabletop.

[Tower, Ari'kian Keep.]

The putrid odors of sweat, urine, and blood confront your sense of smell, threatening to overwhelm it, and each of your other senses. Cedar heartwood planks comprise the floor of the tower. Time and moisture have caused the wood to warp and crack, making your passage somewhat hazardous.  A cold spiraling stone staircase and an open large cobblestone door are here.

The plain hallway comes to an abrupt halt at a rather imposing cobblestone wall. The curvature of its face and the age of the stones date it to well before the building of this small hallway. Set within the cobblestones is a large door, that blends so well it is hardly discernible to the naked eye.  An open large cobblestone door is here.

Heading off the main hallway is a smaller, less elaborate, branch. The marble flooring continues both directions, but it is plain to see that while no expense was spared in the main hallway, the small western hallway is stark in comparison. Two gold brocade chairs rest against the eastern wall, a small oak table sits between them. Bumping up against either chair will get you a mouthful of choking dust.

Entering the foyer the first thing you notice is its subtle opulence. The floor is highly polished black marble, the walls are covered with a gold stripped, cream colored paper. Light filters in through a large paned glass window which, at one time must have glistened, but is now coated with the accumulation of years of dirt. A finely crafted staircase, its balustrade polished from many years of use, rises to the second floor unsupported.

Stepping stones cut across what was once a large lawn. Their destination is the rather imposing manse to the north. Weeds have choked out any grass that may have at one time existed.

A lavish garden stretches between a rocky cliff to the west and a dark keep to the east. The flowers and shrubbery are immaculate, but the landscape is strangely quiet and completely devoid of movement. The lively, vibrant colors of the blossoms contrast with the deathly stillness. A large tunnel descends into the depths of the cliff-face.

Old rusted sconces stand sentry along both sides of this end of the giant tunnel.

The walls of the tunnel bear witness to the constant pressures of the tons of stone above. Water seeps through large fractures to a small pool. Small piles of rocks litter the floor and the air is heavy with moisture. Footsteps produce a crunching rhythm, out of sync with one's quickening heartbeat.

No exit is visible from this section of the tunnel, only a choice of east or west. A few hastily assembled wooden beams seem to support entire weight of the mountain.

While the tunnel is still well made and structurally sound, the air deep within is dank and moist. On closer inspection, hair-line fractures have appeared in the smoothly cut tunnel walls, allowing a few moist rivuletes to seep through onto the granite's surface. The walls are streaked dark from the constant flow of the cold, clear water.

Huge boulders have created a bowl shaped depression in this sheltered hillock. A stand of scruffy trees continues to eke out a tenuous existence above the rocky outpost; their long tortured roots clinging desperately to what little soil is caught between the boulders.

Only the hardiest of life forms hold their own on the rocky steppes. Small cascades of icy water stream down the boulders and darken their surfaces. Tough lichen and scrub pines absorb nutrients from the mineral laden run-off. The sun shines brightly on the southern exposure of the trail, sheltered from the wind and freezing cold. Bright green oases of life sprout from rocky niches and the path is slippery where the green slimy growths cross it.

Branches that were once the top of this enormous tree clutter the makeshift path. Their leaves continuing to grow up and out, even after what must have been many years since the toppling of this giant wonder.  Some large leafy tree branches are here.

This area is illuminated.
You see the 1st wild mountain gnome.
In the area are Oarblade the Noble Hithual, Moten the Noble Hithual, Jurix the Hithual, Haberthan the Noble Hithual, and Nicki the Noble Hithual.
Obvious paths: east* northwest*.

You follow Jurix northwest...

[Tarath Bends.]

A small birds nest has been built within one of the larger cracks of the great tree. Twittering, chirping and the occasional rustling is quite noticeable from the nest as the babies all vie for whatever sustenance their parent brings. A quick flash red and mother bird flies off to find more worms.

Obvious paths: north* southeast*.

You follow Jurix north...

[Tarath Bends.]

The trail winds around the large fallen tree. Smaller saplings, and fungus grows in the soil that is being enriched by the decaying tree. Several rocks dot the newly carved trail around the tree, making travel difficult. It is fairly certain many have cursed the falling of this great tree, and subsequent detour.

This area is illuminated.

[Tarath Bends.]

A large rotted tree lies directly in your path. The trail swerves around the stump, forcing all carts and travelers to fit between a large rock and the upraised roots. Scrapes and scratches on the rock leads one to believe that not every cart has fit through here comfortably.

[Tarath Bends.]

A strong breeze blows off the mountains of the Great Divide. It both slows your climb and encourages your decent into the valley. The brush and trees lean noticeably towards the east, as if it was easier for them to just grow in the direction of the wind then to try and fight their natural instinct of reaching to the sun.

This area is illuminated.
In the area are Oarblade the Noble Hithual, Moten the Noble Hithual, Jurix the Hithual, Haberthan the Noble Hithual, and Nicki the Noble Hithual.
Obvious paths: southeast* west*.

You follow Jurix west...

[Tarath Bends.]

A wide rocky trail heads off into the mountainous terrain in an easterly direction. A large pile of rocks from an old landslide partially blocks passage in the other direction. Cracks and crevasses mar trail's surface, as runoff from the mountain snow makes its way to lower ground. Lush green bushes, and small trees dot the landscape, mingling with large boulders and smaller rocks.  A large pile of rocks is here.

This area is illuminated.

Haberthan kicks at Moten!
The attack misses by a slim margin.

You follow Jurix through a large pile of rocks...

[Tarath Gorge.]

The footing here seems a bit unstable. As you continue on your journey, you wonder what this land was like before the mining began. Something seems to glint in the sunlight on the northern horizon.  A large pile of rocks is here.

This area is illuminated.
In the area are Oarblade the Noble Hithual, Moten the Noble Hithual, Jurix the Hithual, Haberthan the Noble Hithual, and Nicki the Noble Hithual.

Haberthan flails his arms about wildly.

You follow Jurix north...

[Tarath Gorge.]

Rough granite walls rise above you to the east and west. The area here is a bit rougher and seems to have been recently mined. Large veins of silver can be seen. Up overhead, on the western face of the gorge wall a large crack has appeared. Though large enough to fit a Thugian, the only thing exiting the crack is a steady stream of dripping water.

This area is illuminated.

[Tarath Gorge.]

The gorge seems just as large on both sides of you as it did when you first entered it. The sedimentary rock layers in the cliffsides dazzle you with the richness of their color. Looking closer, you see tracks running up to the gate of a massive fort.

[Fort Tarath.]

You stand before a granite wall and large double gated doors. The walls are thick and finely crafted, and there seems to be a rather aged look about them.  The Gate is made of massive slabs of silver, while off to the left and right are the fort's impressive walls, able to withstand a rather large invasion or army if need be.  An open silver-trimmed black drathain gate is here.

Oarblade kicks at Haberthan!
The attack goes wild.

You follow Jurix through an open silver-trimmed black drathain gate...

[Fort Tarath.]

The giant fortification wall is divided into two main sections by huge doors.  These doors have been made from silver and look as though they could stand even the most fearsome battering ram.  Guards standing atop the walls eye you closely.  To the north you can see the business district.  An open silver-trimmed black drathain gate is here.
