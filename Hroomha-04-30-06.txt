Southern Avenue leads between the center of Spur and the homes of the prosperous and wealthy. Several of the Ladies of the city stroll along the avenue chatting about the current events and latest gossip of the Spur. Behind them, harried servants carry their reticules and all those belongings that they cannot be without.  A street lantern is here.

Vast estates tower over the huge Spurian wall towards the south. The well-to-do who live in these homes idle away their days, enjoying the luxury of time. Standing next to a very empty lantern pole, a small Flerian child insists in a plaintive wail, that he had nothing to do with the missing lantern. The well-dressed guard that interrogates him keeps pointing at a small sack on the ground and its obvious contents.  An open small burlap sack, a street lantern, and a lantern are here.

The boughs of a large apple tree hang over the well tended avenue. Below the beautiful tree stands a small fountain. Atop the fountain is an intricately carved Secian who appears to be dancing with the water as it splashes around her. Set in the marble base is a small plaque that reads, "For those who have gone before us." Many stand for a moment as they pass this way, giving thanks for the gift of life that is given by both the apple tree and the Secians of long ago. Large piles of dirt and broken stone lay on either side of the street as workmen ready the east and west alleys for expansion.  A street lantern, an open Secian etched moonsilver door, a pair of open silver forged swinging doors, and a sign above the doors are here.

Standing next to the large iron gate that separates the center of town from those of the elite class are several of the Spurian Guard. They are here to assist all who pass with the simple kindness of opening a gate, or the more important task of escorting those in need to the bank or market. A young looking cadet rubs wax into the stones of the city wall, his task is daunting, but one that will teach him discipline.  An open iron gate and a street lantern are here.

You can make out city guardsmen peering down attentively at all that approach from their posts atop the imposing wall. They seem to take a greater interest in this part of town, though there does not seem to be anything threatening enough here to warrant such attention.

An unusually large home, even for this part of town, lies off to the west. It seems as if one ambitious owner is slowly buying up the lots next to his and adding them to his own. Groundskeepers are at work in the surrounding gardens, trimming and raking, so intent on their work they do not bother to acknowledge the passing traffic on the road.  A street lantern is here.

The occasional locked gate marks the entrance to some of the more hidden estates of Spurs nobility. From this broad avenue, little can be seen of their splendor. Behind the imposing gate recedes a proud drive, disappearing mysteriously into the trees. If not for the large imposing tower rising above the hedges it would be hard to discern anything was beyond the gate. It is apparent the residents do not wish to be disturbed.  A street lantern, a closed morbius door, and an open black iron gate are here.

Through the gate lies the city of Spur, the major center of trade and civilization on the plains. The dusty road leading through the gates is well traveled, and walls of the city are in good repair. A small shack sits to the west of the road, during most times of the day a dusty coach can be seen waiting in front, its horses stomping with impatience to be gone. To the right of the door is a small window, its opening covered with metal bars. An old man, missing most of his teeth, waits patiently for the travelers to pay their fare, and then directs them into the waiting area. On the east side of the road a billowing multicolored tent has been erected, the hustle and bustle of merchants and customers can be seen coming and going at all times of the day.  A rainbow silk tent, an open iron gate, and a fluffy white layer of snow are here.

Clumps of wheat still rise from the ground, valiantly attempting to reestablish, but withered and dead weeds seem to choke the life out of them before they can grab hold.  A small shack can be seen nearby.  Thick smoke billows from the chimney of the building accompanied by a loud ringing of tools against metal.

A small wooden shack sits in the middle of an unkempt field. Broken stepping-stones lead up to the porch that surrounds the shack.  The clanging sound of metal on metal can be heard distinctly from within. The heat of the building radiates even as you stand outside.  Hanging from one chain above the door is a splintered wooden sign that reads, "Welco.."  An open thick wooden door is here.

Heat radiates in this small room as a large blazing fireplace takes up the better part of the far wall. In the center of the room several anvils are set upon large stones. The implements and tools of a smith are kept in an organized manner against the remaining three walls. A rather large hob-goblin pounds away on a sword towards the back of the building, carefully holding it into the fire until it glows and then removing it and shaping it in a well learned manner. So intent upon his work, he doesn't notice anyone who wanders in.  An open thick wooden door and a scratched steel anvil are here.

Gazing straightforward, stony eyed and silent a few hobgo-blin prisoners are restrained in wooden stocks that lie in the center of the encampment.  Two hobgo-blin warriors drag a prisoner up to a whipping post made from a massive steelwood trunk and chain him there.  With a deft flick of his wrist an ancient hobgo-blin warlord uncoils a iron-barbed bullwhip and steps up behind the prisoner.  The snap of the whip splits the air with a deafening CRACK! In a spray of green flesh, blood, and iron barbs, the prisoner's back is flayed to the bone.  A chopping block, an axe, and a row of hob-goblin heads on pikes let all who enter here know that punishment for all infractions of military code is meted out swiftly and without question.

Ducking swiftly through a line of swinging sand bags the hobgo-blin warrior expertly vaults a pit of spikes.  After landing the warrior presses on to the next challenge.

Just past the spike pit to east, a small archery range has been built in this corner of the encampment.  Among a few small, red targets lies carcasses of hundreds dead and rotting animals riddled with the arrows.  Among the dead lies a recently slain bear that would rival any you have ever seen.  A single arrow is lodged deep into its skull directly between its eyes.

Perched on a small platform set high atop a wooden climbing wall is a hobgo-blin warrior seated between two large woven palm frond baskets.  Using his left hand the warrior reaches into one of the baskets and pulls out a thin strip of raw meat, with his right hand he retrieves a jagged rock from the other basket and flings it at a hobgo-blin warrior climbing up beneath him.  Barely dodging the hurtled rock, the climbing hobogoblin warrior clears the last section of wall to confront his comrade.  A brief struggle on the platform ends abruptly as one of the hobgo-blin warriors falls to the earth in defeat.  Drooling slightly, the victor quickly takes a seat on the platform, defending his position viciously with one arm, devouring his rations rapidly with the other.

Down a short path from this overhang lies a deep pit half filled with slime covered stagnant water.  Slender poles have been driven into the bottom of the pit, planted just over an arm span apart, and of varying lengths, they offer perilous footing for crossing to the other side.  With a grunt a large hobgo-blin warrior loses his balance and splashes down in the foul waters of the pit.  The surface of the water near the fallen hobgo-blin warrior suddenly erupts and begins to boil, glittering flashes of silver break the water's surface frantically as hundreds of tiny piranha feast on the luckless soldier's thrashing body.

Just past the spike pit to east, a small archery range has been built in this corner of the encampment.  Among a few small, red targets lies carcasses of hundreds dead and rotting animals riddled with the arrows.  Among the dead lies a recently slain bear that would rival any you have ever seen.  A single arrow is lodged deep into its skull directly between its eyes.  A steelwood handled iron flanged mace and a closed slimy steel coffer are here.

This area is illuminated.

Just past the spike pit to east, a small archery range has been built in this corner of the encampment.  Among a few small, red targets lies carcasses of hundreds dead and rotting animals riddled with the arrows.  Among the dead lies a recently slain bear that would rival any you have ever seen.  A single arrow is lodged deep into its skull directly between its eyes.  A steelwood handled iron flanged mace, a steelwood handled iron flanged mace, a stone tribal pendant, a steelwood handled iron flanged mace, and an open faded bearskin bag are here.

[Hobgo-blin Encampment]

Gazing straightforward, stony eyed and silent a few hobgo-blin prisoners are restrained in wooden stocks that lie in the center of the encampment.  Two hobgo-blin warriors drag a prisoner up to a whipping post made from a massive steelwood trunk and chain him there.  With a deft flick of his wrist an ancient hobgo-blin warlord uncoils a iron-barbed bullwhip and steps up behind the prisoner.  The snap of the whip splits the air with a deafening CRACK! In a spray of green flesh, blood, and iron barbs, the prisoner's back is flayed to the bone.  A chopping block, an axe, and a row of hob-goblin heads on pikes let all who enter here know that punishment for all infractions of military code is meted out swiftly and without question.

Gazing straightforward, stony eyed and silent a few hobgo-blin prisoners are restrained in wooden stocks that lie in the center of the encampment.  Two hobgo-blin warriors drag a prisoner up to a whipping post made from a massive steelwood trunk and chain him there.  With a deft flick of his wrist an ancient hobgo-blin warlord uncoils a iron-barbed bullwhip and steps up behind the prisoner.  The snap of the whip splits the air with a deafening CRACK! In a spray of green flesh, blood, and iron barbs, the prisoner's back is flayed to the bone.  A chopping block, an axe, and a row of hob-goblin heads on pikes let all who enter here know that punishment for all infractions of military code is meted out swiftly and without question.

Perched on a small platform set high atop a wooden climbing wall is a hobgo-blin warrior seated between two large woven palm frond baskets.  Using his left hand the warrior reaches into one of the baskets and pulls out a thin strip of raw meat, with his right hand he retrieves a jagged rock from the other basket and flings it at a hobgo-blin warrior climbing up beneath him.  Barely dodging the hurtled rock, the climbing hobogoblin warrior clears the last section of wall to confront his comrade.  A brief struggle on the platform ends abruptly as one of the hobgo-blin warriors falls to the earth in defeat.  Drooling slightly, the victor quickly takes a seat on the platform, defending his position viciously with one arm, devouring his rations rapidly with the other.

Down a short path from this overhang lies a deep pit half filled with slime covered stagnant water.  Slender poles have been driven into the bottom of the pit, planted just over an arm span apart, and of varying lengths, they offer perilous footing for crossing to the other side.  With a grunt a large hobgo-blin warrior loses his balance and splashes down in the foul waters of the pit.  The surface of the water near the fallen hobgo-blin warrior suddenly erupts and begins to boil, glittering flashes of silver break the water's surface frantically as hundreds of tiny piranha feast on the luckless soldier's thrashing body.  An open darkened bag is here.

Down a short path from this overhang lies a deep pit half filled with slime covered stagnant water.  Slender poles have been driven into the bottom of the pit, planted just over an arm span apart, and of varying lengths, they offer perilous footing for crossing to the other side.  With a grunt a large hobgo-blin warrior loses his balance and splashes down in the foul waters of the pit.  The surface of the water near the fallen hobgo-blin warrior suddenly erupts and begins to boil, glittering flashes of silver break the water's surface frantically as hundreds of tiny piranha feast on the luckless soldier's thrashing body.

Standing single file is a small group of hobgo-blin troops.  Next!" barks an old instructor as a hobgo-blin warrior leaps forward to the first obstacle.  Ducking swiftly through a line of swinging sand bags the hobgo-blin warrior expertly vaults a pit of spikes.  After landing the warrior presses on to the next challenge.  The sharpened bamboo stakes jutting from the mouth emphasize the Hobgo-blin code, "Do or Die!"  A steelwood handled iron flanged mace is here.

Just past the spike pit to east, a small archery range has been built in this corner of the encampment.  Among a few small, red targets lies carcasses of hundreds dead and rotting animals riddled with the arrows.  Among the dead lies a recently slain bear that would rival any you have ever seen.  A single arrow is lodged deep into its skull directly between its eyes.  A steelwood handled iron flanged mace, a steelwood handled iron flanged mace, a stone tribal pendant, a steelwood handled iron flanged mace, and an open faded bearskin bag are here.

Perched on a small platform set high atop a wooden climbing wall is a hobgo-blin warrior seated between two large woven palm frond baskets.  Using his left hand the warrior reaches into one of the baskets and pulls out a thin strip of raw meat, with his right hand he retrieves a jagged rock from the other basket and flings it at a hobgo-blin warrior climbing up beneath him.  Barely dodging the hurtled rock, the climbing hobogoblin warrior clears the last section of wall to confront his comrade.  A brief struggle on the platform ends abruptly as one of the hobgo-blin warriors falls to the earth in defeat.  Drooling slightly, the victor quickly takes a seat on the platform, defending his position viciously with one arm, devouring his rations rapidly with the other.

Gazing straightforward, stony eyed and silent a few hobgo-blin prisoners are restrained in wooden stocks that lie in the center of the encampment.  Two hobgo-blin warriors drag a prisoner up to a whipping post made from a massive steelwood trunk and chain him there.  With a deft flick of his wrist an ancient hobgo-blin warlord uncoils a iron-barbed bullwhip and steps up behind the prisoner.  The snap of the whip splits the air with a deafening CRACK! In a spray of green flesh, blood, and iron barbs, the prisoner's back is flayed to the bone.  A chopping block, an axe, and a row of hob-goblin heads on pikes let all who enter here know that punishment for all infractions of military code is meted out swiftly and without question.  A steelwood handled iron flanged mace and a closed small hardened leather sheath are here.

A rather large hob-goblin pounds away on a sword towards the back of the building, carefully holding it into the fire until it glows and then removing it and shaping it in a well learned manner.

So intent upon his work, he doesn't notice anyone who wanders in.  An open thick wooden door and a scratched steel anvil are here.

A small wooden shack sits in the middle of an unkempt field. Broken stepping-stones lead up to the porch that surrounds the shack.  The clanging sound of metal on metal can be heard distinctly from within. The heat of the building radiates even as you stand outside.  Hanging from one chain above the door is a splintered wooden sign that reads, "Welco.."  An open thick wooden door and an open patched sack are here.

Gazing straightforward, stony eyed and silent a few hobgo-blin prisoners are restrained in wooden stocks that lie in the center of the encampment.  Two hobgo-blin warriors drag a prisoner up to a whipping post made from a massive steelwood trunk and chain him there.  With a deft flick of his wrist an ancient hobgo-blin warlord uncoils a iron-barbed bullwhip and steps up behind the prisoner.  The snap of the whip splits the air with a deafening CRACK! In a spray of green flesh, blood, and iron barbs, the prisoner's back is flayed to the bone.  A chopping block, an axe, and a row of hob-goblin heads on pikes let all who enter here know that punishment for all infractions of military code is meted out swiftly and without question.  A steelwood handled iron flanged mace, a closed small hardened leather sheath, and a loose woven reed fishing basket are here.

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.  A marble statue of a Human, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a rosewood sign, a crisp gold lettered vellum notice, a flowing white marble fountain, and a shimmering marble statue of a Dragon are here.

Just past the spike pit to east, a small archery range has been built in this corner of the encampment.  Among a few small, red targets lies carcasses of hundreds dead and rotting animals riddled with the arrows.  Among the dead lies a recently slain bear that would rival any you have ever seen.  A single arrow is lodged deep into its skull directly between its eyes.

Down a short path from this overhang lies a deep pit half filled with slime covered stagnant water.  Slender poles have been driven into the bottom of the pit, planted just over an arm span apart, and of varying lengths, they offer perilous footing for crossing to the other side.  With a grunt a large hobgo-blin warrior loses his balance and splashes down in the foul waters of the pit.  The surface of the water near the fallen hobgo-blin warrior suddenly erupts and begins to boil, glittering flashes of silver break the water's surface frantically as hundreds of tiny piranha feast on the luckless soldier's thrashing body.

Perched on a small platform set high atop a wooden climbing wall is a hobgo-blin warrior seated between two large woven palm frond baskets.  Using his left hand the warrior reaches into one of the baskets and pulls out a thin strip of raw meat, with his right hand he retrieves a jagged rock from the other basket and flings it at a hobgo-blin warrior climbing up beneath him.  Barely dodging the hurtled rock, the climbing hobogoblin warrior clears the last section of wall to confront his comrade.  A brief struggle on the platform ends abruptly as one of the hobgo-blin warriors falls to the earth in defeat.  Drooling slightly, the victor quickly takes a seat on the platform, defending his position viciously with one arm, devouring his rations rapidly with the other.

Perched on a small platform set high atop a wooden climbing wall is a hobgo-blin warrior seated between two large woven palm frond baskets.  Using his left hand the warrior reaches into one of the baskets and pulls out a thin strip of raw meat, with his right hand he retrieves a jagged rock from the other basket and flings it at a hobgo-blin warrior climbing up beneath him.  Barely dodging the hurtled rock, the climbing hobogoblin warrior clears the last section of wall to confront his comrade.  A brief struggle on the platform ends abruptly as one of the hobgo-blin warriors falls to the earth in defeat.  Drooling slightly, the victor quickly takes a seat on the platform, defending his position viciously with one arm, devouring his rations rapidly with the other.

Ducking swiftly through a line of swinging sand bags the hobgo-blin warrior expertly vaults a pit of spikes.  After landing the warrior presses on to the next challenge.  The sharpened bamboo stakes jutting from the mouth emphasize the Hobgo-blin code, "Do or Die!"

Gazing straightforward, stony eyed and silent a few hobgo-blin prisoners are restrained in wooden stocks that lie in the center of the encampment.  Two hobgo-blin warriors drag a prisoner up to a whipping post made from a massive steelwood trunk and chain him there.  With a deft flick of his wrist an ancient hobgo-blin warlord uncoils a iron-barbed bullwhip and steps up behind the prisoner.  The snap of the whip splits the air with a deafening CRACK! In a spray of green flesh, blood, and iron barbs, the prisoner's back is flayed to the bone.  A chopping block, an axe, and a row of hob-goblin heads on pikes let all who enter here know that punishment for all infractions of military code is meted out swiftly and without question.

Gazing straightforward, stony eyed and silent a few hobgo-blin prisoners are restrained in wooden stocks that lie in the center of the encampment.  Two hobgo-blin warriors drag a prisoner up to a whipping post made from a massive steelwood trunk and chain him there.  With a deft flick of his wrist an ancient hobgo-blin warlord uncoils a iron-barbed bullwhip and steps up behind the prisoner.  The snap of the whip splits the air with a deafening CRACK! In a spray of green flesh, blood, and iron barbs, the prisoner's back is flayed to the bone.  A chopping block, an axe, and a row of hob-goblin heads on pikes let all who enter here know that punishment for all infractions of military code is meted out swiftly and without question.

Perched on a small platform set high atop a wooden climbing wall is a hobgo-blin warrior seated between two large woven palm frond baskets.  Using his left hand the warrior reaches into one of the baskets and pulls out a thin strip of raw meat, with his right hand he retrieves a jagged rock from the other basket and flings it at a hobgo-blin warrior climbing up beneath him.  Barely dodging the hurtled rock, the climbing hobogoblin warrior clears the last section of wall to confront his comrade.  A brief struggle on the platform ends abruptly as one of the hobgo-blin warriors falls to the earth in defeat.  Drooling slightly, the victor quickly takes a seat on the platform, defending his position viciously with one arm, devouring his rations rapidly with the other.

[Hobgo-blin Training Course]

Perched on a small platform set high atop a wooden climbing wall is a hobgo-blin warrior seated between two large woven palm frond baskets.  Using his left hand the warrior reaches into one of the baskets and pulls out a thin strip of raw meat, with his right hand he retrieves a jagged rock from the other basket and flings it at a hobgo-blin warrior climbing up beneath him.  Barely dodging the hurtled rock, the climbing hobogoblin warrior clears the last section of wall to confront his comrade.  A brief struggle on the platform ends abruptly as one of the hobgo-blin warriors falls to the earth in defeat.  Drooling slightly, the victor quickly takes a seat on the platform, defending his position viciously with one arm, devouring his rations rapidly with the other.  A steelwood handled iron flanged mace, a gold coin, some silver coins, and a heavy black wool mourning dress are here.

Down a short path from this overhang lies a deep pit half filled with slime covered stagnant water.  Slender poles have been driven into the bottom of the pit, planted just over an arm span apart, and of varying lengths, they offer perilous footing for crossing to the other side.  With a grunt a large hobgo-blin warrior loses his balance and splashes down in the foul waters of the pit.  The surface of the water near the fallen hobgo-blin warrior suddenly erupts and begins to boil, glittering flashes of silver break the water's surface frantically as hundreds of tiny piranha feast on the luckless soldier's thrashing body.

Just past the spike pit to east, a small archery range has been built in this corner of the encampment.  Among a few small, red targets lies carcasses of hundreds dead and rotting animals riddled with the arrows.  Among the dead lies a recently slain bear that would rival any you have ever seen.  A single arrow is lodged deep into its skull directly between its eyes.

A portly hobgo-blin warrior leans lightly upon the wall of a large bivouac.  His head bobs up and down sporadically as drool pours down his armor.

Gazing straightforward, stony eyed and silent a few hobgo-blin prisoners are restrained in wooden stocks that lie in the center of the encampment.  Two hobgo-blin warriors drag a prisoner up to a whipping post made from a massive steelwood trunk and chain him there.  With a deft flick of his wrist an ancient hobgo-blin warlord uncoils a iron-barbed bullwhip and steps up behind the prisoner.  The snap of the whip splits the air with a deafening CRACK! In a spray of green flesh, blood, and iron barbs, the prisoner's back is flayed to the bone.  A chopping block, an axe, and a row of hob-goblin heads on pikes let all who enter here know that punishment for all infractions of military code is meted out swiftly and without question.

[Hobgo-blin Encampment]

Gazing straightforward, stony eyed and silent a few hobgo-blin prisoners are restrained in wooden stocks that lie in the center of the encampment.  Two hobgo-blin warriors drag a prisoner up to a whipping post made from a massive steelwood trunk and chain him there.  With a deft flick of his wrist an ancient hobgo-blin warlord uncoils a iron-barbed bullwhip and steps up behind the prisoner.  The snap of the whip splits the air with a deafening CRACK! In a spray of green flesh, blood, and iron barbs, the prisoner's back is flayed to the bone.  A chopping block, an axe, and a row of hob-goblin heads on pikes let all who enter here know that punishment for all infractions of military code is meted out swiftly and without question.  An open delicate lionskin sack is here.

Gazing straightforward, stony eyed and silent a few hobgo-blin prisoners are restrained in wooden stocks that lie in the center of the encampment.  Two hobgo-blin warriors drag a prisoner up to a whipping post made from a massive steelwood trunk and chain him there.  With a deft flick of his wrist an ancient hobgo-blin warlord uncoils a iron-barbed bullwhip and steps up behind the prisoner.  The snap of the whip splits the air with a deafening CRACK! In a spray of green flesh, blood, and iron barbs, the prisoner's back is flayed to the bone.  A chopping block, an axe, and a row of hob-goblin heads on pikes let all who enter here know that punishment for all infractions of military code is meted out swiftly and without question.

Ducking swiftly through a line of swinging sand bags the hobgo-blin warrior expertly vaults a pit of spikes.  After landing the warrior presses on to the next challenge.  The sharpened bamboo stakes jutting from the mouth emphasize the Hobgo-blin code, "Do or Die!"

Among a few small, red targets lies carcasses of hundreds dead and rotting animals riddled with the arrows.  Among the dead lies a recently slain bear that would rival any you have ever seen.  A single arrow is lodged deep into its skull directly between its eyes.

Just past the spike pit to east, a small archery range has been built in this corner of the encampment.  Among a few small, red targets lies carcasses of hundreds dead and rotting animals riddled with the arrows.  Among the dead lies a recently slain bear that would rival any you have ever seen.  A single arrow is lodged deep into its skull directly between its eyes.  A steelwood handled iron flanged mace and a rough hewn maple shield are here.

This area is illuminated.

[Hobgo-blin Training Course]

Just past the spike pit to east, a small archery range has been built in this corner of the encampment.  Among a few small, red targets lies carcasses of hundreds dead and rotting animals riddled with the arrows.  Among the dead lies a recently slain bear that would rival any you have ever seen.  A single arrow is lodged deep into its skull directly between its eyes.  A steelwood handled iron flanged mace and a rough hewn maple shield are here.

This area is illuminated.
You see the 1st hobgo-blin warrior corpse.
In the area is Ner'zul the Noble Oog-ra.
Obvious paths: north northeast east.
But the hobgo-blin warrior is dead!

Just past the spike pit to east, a small archery range has been built in this corner of the encampment.  Among a few small, red targets lies carcasses of hundreds dead and rotting animals riddled with the arrows.  Among the dead lies a recently slain bear that would rival any you have ever seen.  A single arrow is lodged deep into its skull directly between its eyes.  A steelwood handled iron flanged mace, a rough hewn maple shield, a steelwood handled iron flanged mace, a steelwood handled iron flanged mace, a closed colorful sack, and a closed flowery doeskin bag are here.

This area is illuminated.
You see the 1st hobgo-blin archer.
In the area is Ner'zul the Noble Oog-ra.
Obvious paths: north northeast east.

Down a short path from this overhang lies a deep pit half filled with slime covered stagnant water.  Slender poles have been driven into the bottom of the pit, planted just over an arm span apart, and of varying lengths, they offer perilous footing for crossing to the other side.  With a grunt a large hobgo-blin warrior loses his balance and splashes down in the foul waters of the pit.  The surface of the water near the fallen hobgo-blin warrior suddenly erupts and begins to boil, glittering flashes of silver break the water's surface frantically as hundreds of tiny piranha feast on the luckless soldier's thrashing body.

[Hobgo-blin Training Course]

Down a short path from this overhang lies a deep pit half filled with slime covered stagnant water.  Slender poles have been driven into the bottom of the pit, planted just over an arm span apart, and of varying lengths, they offer perilous footing for crossing to the other side.  With a grunt a large hobgo-blin warrior loses his balance and splashes down in the foul waters of the pit.  The surface of the water near the fallen hobgo-blin warrior suddenly erupts and begins to boil, glittering flashes of silver break the water's surface frantically as hundreds of tiny piranha feast on the luckless soldier's thrashing body.

This area is illuminated.
You see the 1st hobgo-blin warlord corpse and the 1st hobgo-blin archer.
In the area is Ner'zul the Noble Oog-ra.
Obvious paths: east southeast south.

Ner'zul strips the hobgo-blin warlord's body.

The hobgo-blin warlord turns to dust.
I don't see what you are referring to.

Perched on a small platform set high atop a wooden climbing wall is a hobgo-blin warrior seated between two large woven palm frond baskets.  Using his left hand the warrior reaches into one of the baskets and pulls out a thin strip of raw meat, with his right hand he retrieves a jagged rock from the other basket and flings it at a hobgo-blin warrior climbing up beneath him.  Barely dodging the hurtled rock, the climbing hobogoblin warrior clears the last section of wall to confront his comrade.  A brief struggle on the platform ends abruptly as one of the hobgo-blin warriors falls to the earth in defeat.  Drooling slightly, the victor quickly takes a seat on the platform, defending his position viciously with one arm, devouring his rations rapidly with the other.

Two hobgo-blin warriors drag a prisoner up to a whipping post made from a massive steelwood trunk and chain him there.  With a deft flick of his wrist an ancient hobgo-blin warlord uncoils a iron-barbed bullwhip and steps up behind the prisoner.  The snap of the whip splits the air with a deafening CRACK! In a spray of green flesh, blood, and iron barbs, the prisoner's back is flayed to the bone.

A small wooden shack sits in the middle of an unkempt field. Broken stepping-stones lead up to the porch that surrounds the shack.  The clanging sound of metal on metal can be heard distinctly from within. The heat of the building radiates even as you stand outside.  Hanging from one chain above the door is a splintered wooden sign that reads, "Welco.."  An open thick wooden door, a steelwood handled iron flanged mace, a steelwood handled iron flanged mace, and a rusty iron sewer grate are here.

Heat radiates in this small room as a large blazing fireplace takes up the better part of the far wall. In the center of the room several anvils are set upon large stones. The implements and tools of a smith are kept in an organized manner against the remaining three walls. A rather large hob-goblin pounds away on a sword towards the back of the building, carefully holding it into the fire until it glows and then removing it and shaping it in a well learned manner. So intent upon his work, he doesn't notice anyone who wanders in.  An open thick wooden door and a scratched steel anvil are here.

Gazing straightforward, stony eyed and silent a few hobgo-blin prisoners are restrained in wooden stocks that lie in the center of the encampment.  Two hobgo-blin warriors drag a prisoner up to a whipping post made from a massive steelwood trunk and chain him there.  With a deft flick of his wrist an ancient hobgo-blin warlord uncoils a iron-barbed bullwhip and steps up behind the prisoner.  The snap of the whip splits the air with a deafening CRACK! In a spray of green flesh, blood, and iron barbs, the prisoner's back is flayed to the bone.  A chopping block, an axe, and a row of hob-goblin heads on pikes let all who enter here know that punishment for all infractions of military code is meted out swiftly and without question.

Down a short path from this overhang lies a deep pit half filled with slime covered stagnant water.  Slender poles have been driven into the bottom of the pit, planted just over an arm span apart, and of varying lengths, they offer perilous footing for crossing to the other side.  With a grunt a large hobgo-blin warrior loses his balance and splashes down in the foul waters of the pit.  The surface of the water near the fallen hobgo-blin warrior suddenly erupts and begins to boil, glittering flashes of silver break the water's surface frantically as hundreds of tiny piranha feast on the luckless soldier's thrashing body.

Perched on a small platform set high atop a wooden climbing wall is a hobgo-blin warrior seated between two large woven palm frond baskets.  Using his left hand the warrior reaches into one of the baskets and pulls out a thin strip of raw meat, with his right hand he retrieves a jagged rock from the other basket and flings it at a hobgo-blin warrior climbing up beneath him.  Barely dodging the hurtled rock, the climbing hobogoblin warrior clears the last section of wall to confront his comrade.  A brief struggle on the platform ends abruptly as one of the hobgo-blin warriors falls to the earth in defeat.  Drooling slightly, the victor quickly takes a seat on the platform, defending his position viciously with one arm, devouring his rations rapidly with the other.

Two hobgo-blin warriors drag a prisoner up to a whipping post made from a massive steelwood trunk and chain him there.  With a deft flick of his wrist an ancient hobgo-blin warlord uncoils a iron-barbed bullwhip and steps up behind the prisoner.  The snap of the whip splits the air with a deafening CRACK! In a spray of green flesh, blood, and iron barbs, the prisoner's back is flayed to the bone.  A chopping block, an axe, and a row of hob-goblin heads on pikes let all who enter here know that punishment for all infractions of military code is meted out swiftly and without question.

A muddy hole lies directly beneath a dense sticker strewn bush.  Pressed up against a tall wooden wall, the bush has obviously grown wild for many years and has been left to grow wild.  The dense, overgrown foliage blocks the view into the surrounding area.  A knotted rope has been tied to one of the larger branches of the bush and leads up over the top of the wall.  A gap in the bushes, a steelwood handled iron flanged mace, an open stained sack, a steelwood handled iron flanged mace, and a closed layered bag are here.

A closed tall wooden gate is here.

Mud and muck cover the roadway and pier, testament to the high traffic in the area. Men and women unload large cargo ships. Enormous quantities of food come into the city from the docks, and many other goods besides. Goods are moved into the city via the new trade road to the northwest. A pile of lumber stands nearby for future improvements.  An open small oak crate and an open small oak crate are here.

Mud and muck cover the roadway and pier, testament to the high traffic in the area. Men and women unload large cargo ships. Enormous quantities of food come into the city from the docks, and many other goods besides. Goods are moved into the city via the new trade road to the northwest.

The rickety dock gives way to soft packed soil.  A freshly made path cuts through the dense forest vegetation to the west. The smell of fresh lumber wafts through the air. A large magnificent building has been built next to the last step of the docks. Travelers pause and take a glance into the beautiful window front of the building, their pleasure at seeing such nice items is evident on their faces.  Some flapping colorful flags, a ship shaped rosewood hanging sign, and an open dazzling painted lemonwood door are here.

Through the gate lies the city of Spur, the major center of trade and civilization on the plains. The dusty road leading through the gates is well traveled, and walls of the city are in good repair. A small shack sits to the west of the road, during most times of the day a dusty coach can be seen waiting in front, its horses stomping with impatience to be gone. To the right of the door is a small window, its opening covered with metal bars. An old man, missing most of his teeth, waits patiently for the travelers to pay their fare, and then directs them into the waiting area. On the east side of the road a billowing multicolored tent has been erected, the hustle and bustle of merchants and customers can be seen coming and going at all times of the day.  A rainbow silk tent, an open iron gate, and a fluffy white layer of snow are here.

An exit, a fresh painted sign pointing northeast, and a sun and moon trimmed sign are here.

[Festival of Magick, Levitating Disc.]

The platform on which you stand is made out of a thick glass, lending a distorted view of clouds and stars lazily passing beneath it. A powerful, softly humming force provides an unseen wall for safety of its passengers as the platform floats mysteriously upon the air. Within the bubble of energy, be it day or night, the air glows a combination of fiery reds and oranges against a darkened blue. Stars faintly glow and twinkle in the dusty light of both the sun and the moon.  A thick transparent glass platform, some glowing twinkling stars, a fiery sunset of varying hues, some floating glass steps, and some misty grey spiraling clouds heading down are here.

This area is illuminated.

>[Festival of Magick, Entrance.]

An ornate wrought iron fence, detailed with the various runes for each class, surrounds a raised platform in the center of the area; the runes glow and pulsate. The clouds beneath your feet give gently with each footstep, leaving ethereal impressions momentarily before fluffing back up. Above, the sky is alive with streaks of lightening that dance back and forth between more clouds and illuminate the orange-red sky with flashes of brilliant white. Misty letters swirl before you, shifting and melding together into sentences.  Some fluffy white clouds, some glowing dancing lightning streaks, some misty swirling words in the sky, a hovering oak door partially open, an open runesilver handled glass trapdoor, and some floating glass steps are here.

This area is illuminated.

>[Magick Festival, Tavern and Stage.]

Passing through the door, you have entered another plane of existence. The night sky folds like dark blue runesilk against a backdrop of twinkling stars. A large moon shines its soft brilliance upon a floating glass stage, providing a natural spotlight to those performing. Tables and chairs hover a few feet from the floor, covered in a rich velvety green grass, while small levitating discs act as stairs to and from them. Tumultuous light flashes behind the door, leading back to the entrance of the Faire.  A softly illuminated moon and shining stars, some magickally suspended tables, some magickally suspended chairs, a circular glass levitating stage, and a hovering oak door partially open are here.

Clear, thick runic-etched glass makes up the walls and floor of this room, each giving a spectacular view of the festival grounds. A large display case floats midair, displaying an array of fantastical items. Small sun and moon shaped orbs orbit around each other, casting a greenish light upon the glass. At first glance, there does not appear to exit, but a flickering of shifting of scenery against one wall indicates it is only an illusion.  A glowing hovering yellowed sunstone orb, a glowing hovering bluish moonstone orb, and an open translucent pale blue silk curtain are here.

There are no corners to this room; everything is spherical and smooth. The marble that makes up the walls are smooth, veined with obsidian and amethyst. A crystal display case lays flat on a transparent glass floor, in order to provide customers sure footing. Fanciful clothing has been folded perfectly, displayed in rows within the case. A smaller rack displays a few interesting jewelry pieces. A sign reading EXIT hangs mysteriously to the northeast of the area. Occasionally, a flicker and outline of a door gives the illusion of an actual exit.  Some sparkling multicolored crystal display cases and a glowing faux circular window viewing a sunset are here.

A powerful, softly humming force provides an unseen wall for safety of its passengers as the platform floats mysteriously upon the air. Within the bubble of energy, be it day or night, the air glows a combination of fiery reds and oranges against a darkened blue.

Through the gate lies the city of Spur, the major center of trade and civilization on the plains. The dusty road leading through the gates is well traveled, and walls of the city are in good repair. A small shack sits to the west of the road, during most times of the day a dusty coach can be seen waiting in front, its horses stomping with impatience to be gone. To the right of the door is a small window, its opening covered with metal bars. An old man, missing most of his teeth, waits patiently for the travelers to pay their fare, and then directs them into the waiting area. On the east side of the road a billowing multicolored tent has been erected, the hustle and bustle of merchants and customers can be seen coming and going at all times of the day.  A rainbow silk tent, an open iron gate, and a fluffy white layer of snow are here.

The occasional locked gate marks the entrance to some of the more hidden estates of Spurs nobility. From this broad avenue, little can be seen of their splendor. Behind the imposing gate recedes a proud drive, disappearing mysteriously into the trees. If not for the large imposing tower rising above the hedges it would be hard to discern anything was beyond the gate. It is apparent the residents do not wish to be disturbed.  A street lantern, a closed morbius door, and an open black iron gate are here.

Majestic elms continue to line this broad roadway, sheltering the avenue on both sides and further enhancing the grandiose atmosphere. Fronting the beautiful homes, cobbled paths edged with narrow flower beds meander through nearby private gardens. Though they appear wonderful places to spend an afternoon or take a picnic, the glances from those tending the estates makes it clear they are only for the invited.  A street lantern is here.

Numerous trees lining the avenue serve as the dividing border between the majestic estates of the nobility and the lightly traveled roadway.

The entire avenue is composed of fine cobblestone, each level with its neighbor, providing a smooth ride for passing carriages and horses.

Leaving the exceptionally wealthy estates of the Spurian nobility, Noble Way heads toward the Town Square to the northwest. Along the roadside can be seen the in-city homes of successful merchants and other wealthy citizens of the Spur. The homes display a slightly different style, perhaps they are not quite so restrained; a touch more exuberance and freedom with materials is displayed.  A street lantern is here.

Noble Way continues to wind its way among the rather modestly sized, but elegant, homes of the Spur's successful. Many a peasant farmer may live in homes larger than these, but none can match the quality found here.

Atop the fountain is an intricately carved Secian who appears to be dancing with the water as it splashes around her. Set in the marble base is a small plaque that reads, "For those who have gone before us." Many stand for a moment as they pass this way, giving thanks for the gift of life that is given by both the apple tree and the Secians of long ago. Large piles of dirt and broken stone lay on either side of the street as workmen ready the east and west alleys for expansion.

The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.  A marble statue of a Human, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a rosewood sign, a crisp gold lettered vellum notice, a flowing white marble fountain, a shimmering marble statue of a Dragon, a short wooden stick, a slightly dented brass buckler, and a tattered old book of notes are here.

[Town Square Center.]

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.  A marble statue of a Human, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a rosewood sign, a crisp gold lettered vellum notice, a flowing white marble fountain, a shimmering marble statue of a Dragon, a short wooden stick, a slightly dented brass buckler, and a tattered old book of notes are here.

Each counter is divided into two sections; one side for displaying lose gems and uncut stones, the other for finished jewelry that is ready to be sold. To the rear of the building is a small desk with a glowing rune-enscribed lamp sitting on it. The desk is cluttered with loose gems that have yet to be examined. A small bookshelf rises up from the back of the desk containing several books on gems and minerals. A single solid black book labeled "borrowed goods" has been tucked away at the end of the shelf.

Two large glass display windows housing a brilliant array of gems and jewelry glisten brightly in the light provided from the overhead glass dome. Nestled between the two windows is a finely detailed frosted glass door. The marble flooring leading up to the door is polished to a glossy finish. A colorful awning stretching out from window to window provides enough shade from the sky light above to allow shoppers to peer into the windows and admire the true beauty of the jewelry on display.  A diamond shaped wooden sign and an open diamond cut frosted glass door are here.

In this grand hall, your eyes are instantly drawn upwards to the glittering geodesic dome ceiling. Held together with a dizzying amount of wrought iron latticework and interlocking crystal panes, light pours in during the day, casting tiny rainbows throughout the interior, to the delight of small Frontacian children. At night strategically placed light crystals cast soft but ample light. The white marble floor beneath you is expertly polished, and a well-kept garden centerpiece surrounded by teak benches provides a leisurely atmosphere to the area. Dazzling arrays of diverse shops surround you, each sporting differently decorated doors, signs and display windows.  Some teak benches and an open gold trimmed revolving glass door are here.

Looking somewhat our of place among the landscape of polished white marble, a strange store lies here. Set into the silvery lacquered teak shop front, a pair of glass display windows flank the foreign door. Customers peer into the displays as they pass, always noticing a new exotic luxury. A purple and silver decorative awning overhangs the front piece, the woven silk subtly billowing in passing breezes.  Just above the door, a sign written in a spidery script reads, "The Imports House Fantastico" in inlaid silver. A pair of passing Frontacian children tug at the sleeve of their mother, begging her to take them into the mysterious establishment.  A curiously lettered silver sign and an open exotic sliding mahogany door are here.

The black marble floor of this strange establishment has a glossy finish, but it casts little sheen. Inconsistent and irregular light flickers from candles placed strategically in mirrored niches around the establishment. The walls and ceiling are swathed with colored silks, in deep regal purples, blues and blacks, interwoven with shimmering metallic thread. A few brass incense burners also hang from the ceiling, emitting subtle but unrecognizable scents. Polished sandstone counters support some low glass and black velvet display cases, hosting strange and varied items. Towards the rear, a black lacquered desk is covered in oddly lettered scrolls, ink maps and intricate diagrams of unknown design. A purple robed go-blin-al pours over the desk, glancing up on occasion to answer a customer's question.   A closed saltwater stained lemonwood sea chest, a closed saltwater stained lemonwood sea chest, and an open exotic sliding mahogany door are here.

Two rune-etched golden dragon statues on either side of the doorway stand guard protectively outside the shop. Inside the mouth of each dragon is a series of glowing runes that shoot out a small spark to give the appearance of fire while providing adequate lighting for those entering.

Softly glowing golden orbs float about illuminating the shop with a mystical light. Runes embedded in the store's stucco walls blink and glitter adding life to their dark crimson paint. Polished mahogany shelves showcase the organized assortment of magickal trinkets and weapons while a glass display case boasts a collection of potions and other concoctions. A large attendant stands protectively in front of a locked cabinet filled with dangerous looking items. He keeps a watchful eye on a pair of Frontacian children chasing each other around with crackling display wands as their parents browse about oblivious to their actions.

The air is uncomfortably warm in the cramped store. Clothing fills nearly every corner of the dim room; spilling over shelves, crowding racks, and piling in corners and on stools. The majority of the clothing hangs with little sign of order on a wooden rod that runs along one side of the long, thin space. Gilded antique mirrors adorn every unoccupied bit of wall. The back of the store hosts a cluster of pedestals of varying heights, a pair of shoes adorning each one. A few carefully placed sconces provide just enough light to illuminate select pieces of merchandise and cause the polished teak floor to gleam. A few well-dressed mannequins are placed inconveniently throughout the area causing further crowding amongst shoppers. Muffled voices giving opinions on outfits can be heard from behind the dressing room curtain. A Sanene woman lurks in the shadows waiting to assist you.  A well dressed mannequin, a pair of crystal pumps on a pedestal, a large antique gilded mirror, and an open serpent handled teak door are here.

The sweeping branches cast cool shadows across both the area and the benches nestled beneath.

The filtered light from the window barely reaches through to the room. A few floating candles hover in the air providing minimal light where the window cannot. The shades of light dance upon the mountains of books that fill this room. From ceiling to floor, this store has been filled to the brim with all sorts of books: ancient looking leather bound books whose bindings have come loose, mysterious dark tomes, covered in ancient runes, and thick codices of lore and history from times long past. Volume upon volume have been stacked high forming large columns of books. The labyrinth of tomes conceals a stairway leading down to a wooden door. In the back, a wrinkled old Usil sits quietly behind the counter reading a book of his own.

The delicate fragrance of fresh roses wafts in through a beautiful ruby arched door. A large black awning softens the glare from the overhead light and creates an alluring atmosphere. To the left of the arch, a small window displays a number of different lotions and titillating adult items.  A picnic basket filled with several aphrodisiacs, a bottle of champagne and chocolate-covered strawberries sits below a scantily clad mannequin dressed in a ravishing black silk negligee. A dowdy priggish looking woman shields her young son's eyes as she quickly ushers him past the shop.  An open ruby encrusted arched door is here.

The rows of shops along South Merchant Avenue give way to several road houses, eateries, and upper-scale lodges. Beneath the flickering torches that flank a stately mahogany door, a covered vestibule protects those waiting for carriages from the elements. During business hours, porters wisk guest's luggage through a discreet service door. A pair of oak doors read "Circle Inn" in mahogany inlay. The torches cast long shadows onto this quiet corner of hotel row.  A pair of open oak and mahogany doors are here.

Entering you are greeted with the most fantastic aroma of distant recipes and exotic ingredients wafting through the air. Fragrant and strangely shaped brass oil lamps hang from the ceiling, casting ample but irregular light below. The walls are draped in bright velvets and interwoven with swirling burnished gold and silvers. On top of the etched sandstone and silken-carpeted flooring, a wide variety of brass and copper tables and adjoining chairs invite you to sit and enjoy a drink. Luckily there are a few unoccupied tables, as discerning customers have already claimed many. In the corners, booths skillfully draped with cloth ensure privacy from prying eyes. In the back an exotically clad go-blin-al chats with patrons from behind a copper topped counter, serving a wide variety of foreign food and drink. Nearby, soothing music streams from a talented pair of young musicians. You are just barely able to catch a glimpse of the flurry of activity in the kitchen through some flowing curtains behind the counter.  A copper topped glass counter, some dangerously tall copper barstools, some exotic style table and chairs, some orange pinstriped broadcloth reclining couches, and an open elegantly embossed copper door are here.

A hand-carved rosewood sign creaks in the light breeze reading, "Rose Eternal", a venerable landmark of Spur.  Delicate carvings chase across the front door and windows sashes in glowing, hand-polished rosewood. Two full flower boxes hang from the front windows, each overflowing with trailing rose bushes that bloom in hues that vary from soft pink to pink tinted white. A stout Drag-al barks at the crowds that pass, telling off-color jokes and smiling a huge obsequious grin. A cigar stubs smokes from his toothy grimace.

Illumination from the dim oil lamps barely cuts through spilt drink and stale tobacco scented air.  A group of drag-als that seem to have become a permanent fixture here beckons you to join them for a pitcher of ale, and motions to the bartender indicating that you're paying.  Without bothering to acknowledge them, the bartender flashes a toothless grin toward a crowd more likely to have a few coins in their pockets, points them toward a table in the back and offers them an etched wood menu.  An open finely carved rosewood door, a small stage, and a slightly stained parchment placard on the bar are here.

An assortment of small locked glass display cases atop finely carved mahogany pedestals are placed about this shop. Each case contains a unique and exquisite piece of fine jewelry, polished to shine in the light cast by the large glowing crystal chandelier hanging from the center of the ceiling.  A locked glass-fronted duskwood case towards the rear of the shop is filled with figurines, some more ordinary looking jewelry and assorted collectibles. One of the pale grey walls is covered with a beautiful mural of a forest grove - a light fog flecked with gold swirls in an archway formed by the trees and in the center are two gleaming golden eyes, the form of the muscular tiger they belong to barely outlined in the fog. The other walls are hung with charts listing the properties of precious and semi-precious gems and metals and the various methods of gemstone cutting.  A soft midnight blue leather upholstered couch, an open smooth edged pine charity bin, and an open exquisite stained-glass door are here.

The center of this broad avenue is commanded by a tastefully sized polished gray granite fountain. The streets around the fountain are flooded with people of all races and sizes, rushing about from shop to shop. A group of Humans are standing just to one side of the fountain, conversing in their language, and gesturing at a particular shop that looks to cater to everyone but Humans. A San Elf stands just to one side, his eyes darting every now and then towards the groups coin purses.  A polished grey granite fountain, an open heavy wooden eight-paneled door, an open exquisite stained-glass trinket shop doorway, a glowing elegant wrought iron street lantern, and a moonsilver-etched sign are here.

A bell above the door tinkles as you enter this cluttered shop. Light filters in through a dusty window and glints off various metals and gemstones around the room, a bright blue and purple glass mosaic lamp on the counter provides further illumination. Weapon and armor racks are scattered haphazardly around the room, though the most valuable are displayed on a pair of ornate racks in the center of the room. A glass-fronted curio cabinet against one wall allows for the display of jewelry, several lockpicks and an array of trinkets. The glass-fronted counter contains a number of carefully labeled bottles and jars. A tall, metallic silver-eyed youth clad in simple brown clothing apart from an ornate dragon-shaped bluesteel pendant sits on an old stool behind the cluttered counter, idly flipping through the pages of a book. Behind the shopkeeper atop a cluttered bookshelf is a heavy steelwood lockbox; deeply carved into its lid is an arcane rune that glows with a faint green light.   An open sturdy blackened oak door is here.

The scent of jasmine fills the air as you enter, a small incense burner near the door gives off a few small clouds of smoke. The front windows of the shop allow plenty of light from the street to enter and show off it's wares. A young leuian walks forward to greet you, his eyes sparkling as he bows deeply before asking if he may help you with anything. A jewelry case separates the work area of the shop from the front. Gems of all shapes and sizes adorn the work bench.  A closed transparent glass case, a closed black oak display shelf, and an open wooden door are here.

Craftsmen mingle with well-dressed matrons along North Market Street. Foot traffic passes quickly near the major artery of Spur's merchant district; the flow and ebb of its walking tide predictable at lunch and after hours. Young cadets strut proudly in their new scholarly robes in varying hues of blue as they march towards their temple, praising Sa's might loudly. A loving Human couple strolls past admiring a set of matched sparkling yellow diamonds displayed on a box covered with celadon green velvet in the window.  A pair of tasteful embossed mahogany doors, an open lacquered silver maple door, and a glowing elegant wrought iron street lantern are here.

Horse drawn carraiges pass dilapidated two-wheeled carts as items are purchased at the "going" price and replacements brought in by craftsmen, hoping to drive a good profit. A brightly dressed dandy prances past the Haberdashery, waving his dainty lace handkerchief at the smiling clerk inside. Just outside another doorway, a pretty San Elf maiden crouches, rubbing her ankle from the bad turn she took just teetering a few feet from the door in her new high-heeled snakeskin boots.  A stylish glass windowed mahogany door, an open iron studded pine door displaying a shoe, and a glowing elegant wrought iron street lantern are here.

Children giggle buoyantly as they do small chores around the store for a few coins. The seamstress scolds them loudly before turning back to the tall man, smiling as she measures him for a new outfit. The room smells of fragrant pipe smoke wafting through a doorway leading to a backroom. A tall Human man, handsomely dressed in fine clothes, awaits you at the counter ready to fill the incoming orders. A shiny silver plaque hangs upon the wall above the counter.  An engraved silver plaque and an open stylish glass windowed mahogany door are here.

A brightly dressed dandy prances past the Haberdashery, waving his dainty lace handkerchief at the smiling clerk inside.

The fragrance of newly cured leather filters through the dark, dusty air of the Cobbler Shop. A short, harried and hairy man of indistinguishable racial origin scurries around fitting boots, shoes and sandals on the feet of all who enter his shop. The constant "ping" of hammers on nails and leather sounds from a distant back room, punctuated occasionally with the loud curse of a mis-stroke.  Leather scraps of all colors cover the floor.   An iron studded pine door displaying a shoe is here.

The faintest chilly breeze winds its way through this shop, causing the delicate moonsilk snowflakes hanging from the ceiling to sway and spin as their crystal sequins catch the light and cast hypnotic white glimmers upon the cloudy blue walls. A set of tiny, icicle-shaped glass windchimes twirl and tinkle against each other, creating a soft melody that provides reprieve from the hustle and bustle of Spur's business district. Placed aesthetically about the enclosure are several white marble display cases and racks, all boasting ebony taloned Dragon feet at their sturdy bases. Behind a diminutive desk fashioned in a similar manner is a smiling Secian, with wings at the ready should a customer need help with an item or two. The items themselves reflect the current season, displayed proudly in the center of the store, while the sale items hang from a circular rack near the frosted bay window that provides a view into the Spurian market.  An open white pine moonsilk draped doorway is here.

The colors continue across the round door, making it nearly impossible to distinguish from the walls. Two young Flerian children with dirt caked feet count their tin boxes of shiny treasures on the stoop.  A street lantern and an open round door painted orange are here.

The dark line of old row-houses parts temporarily for a boisterous saloon with its black swinging doors that flings dead, partially dead and drunk patrons onto the mucky street.  A street lantern and a pair of skull inlaid ebony swinging doors are here.

The northeastern section of the merchant's district has been quietly cleared away and replaced by a brand new brick building. The clean red bricks have a new and well scrubbed look, the door is sturdy and and inviting. The small gilded sign that hangs over the entrance announcing "Aldo's Talisman Pendents" as the proprietor of this shop is covered with a carefully scrawled cardboard note saying, "NOW OPEN." Decorating the front of the building are planters filled with various colored flowers.  A street lantern, an open mystical starburst patterned jade door, and an ornate drathain trimmed archway are here.

Sawdust has barely settled on the floor and already rattan, pik, kobold, and go-blin-al alike are running amok. Mongrels of all breeds down tankards of booze while gambling on quick card games that, as a rule, end in violent bloodshed more often than not. The plinking of a tired old piano struggles to lend cheer to the lonesome atmosphere. Patrons here are quick to the draw. Wanted posters adorn the walls depicting many of their faces, serving for bragging rights rather than law officials. The bartender, a rather burly looking human with a thick mustache, stands behind the counter cleaning glasses with a rag and phlegmy wads of spit. A large crossbow mounted on the wall behind him remains loaded at all times, in case any of the patrons get too out of hand. With a reluctant nod, he motions towards shelves of items and a list of prices on the back wall.  An old Go-blin-al playing a piano, some crooked wooden tables, a dusty bar counter, some bolts stuck in the wall, a giant stuffed wall-mounted boar head, an old rickety wooden piano, a giant stuffed hairy baboon, and a pair of skull inlaid ebony swinging doors are here.

Wanted posters adorn the walls depicting many of their faces, serving for bragging rights rather than law officials. The bartender, a rather burly looking human with a thick mustache, stands behind the counter cleaning glasses with a rag and phlegmy wads of spit. A large crossbow mounted on the wall behind him remains loaded at all times, in case any of the patrons get too out of hand. With a reluctant nod, he motions towards shelves of items and a list of prices on the back wall.  An old Go-blin-al playing a piano, some crooked wooden tables, a dusty bar counter, some bolts stuck in the wall, a giant stuffed wall-mounted boar head, an old rickety wooden piano, a giant stuffed hairy baboon, and a pair of skull inlaid ebony swinging doors are here.

Comfortably warm air swirls around you. Its source a giant stone fireplace located at the back of the shop. A work bench rests just to the side of a stone fireplace for Aldo to work on his pendants. A sphere of soft, white light hovering near the peak of the shop's ceiling illuminates every corner.  The white light sparkles off a highly polished glass faced display cabinet nestled against a side wall. Along the other wall, various talisman pendants, nestled in beds of deep black velvet, are displayed inside a gleaming glass counter.  An intricately carved mahogany cane, a rocking chair, and an open mystical starburst patterned jade door are here.

A young Hithual working behind the counter gives you a gruff nod and watches you expectantly as you enter. A long counter made from a single piece of granite runs the length of the back wall. Fine armors and weapons are on display around the room, the best of which hang behind the counter. An elaborate candle holder made up of several interlocked battle-axes hangs from the center of the ceiling illuminating the area.

This dark room is faintly illuminated by barely burning wrought iron torches that line the damp pitch-black brick walls. Screams of various races can be faintly heard echoing through the room, apparently coming from behind the walls. A cold and eerie chill sweeps through your body making you grin with delight, or shiver with fright as you peruse the vast shelves or merchandise all that seem to appeal to your darker side. An attractive Sanene female wearing a wickedly spiked thorn choker and a full studded leather body suit stands behind a cold iron counter glaring at you through her hypnotic pitch black eyes.

The multicolored cobblestone road leads past a giant casino. Faint sounds of shouting and occasional music echo from inside the building. Depending on the time of day or night, shifty looking San elf or Thugian stands sentry at the rear entrance. They gaze at you briefly to size you up before extending the offer of a "cheap pass" into the casino through a backdoor. Holding a hand out and waiting for the stipulated entrance fee, before unfastening a rope that holds the door shut, and allowing those who pay entrance.   A street lantern is here.

A large, woven rush mat at the door welcomes you into a brightly lit shop.  The glossy golden pine floor and strategically placed mirrors on the walls gently reflect the light shed by dozens of different lamps, lanterns, and magikal illuminations.  A short, round, glass display case holds a selection of candles in a variety of hues and scents. Torches and lanterns are affixed to the walls in neatly spaced rows.  At the back of the shop a cheerful male Secian sits on a tall stool behind a mirrored counter.  Behind him float several magikal illumination orbs glowing a rainbow of different colors.   A glowing bright crimson paper lantern on a stick, a glowing Dragon patterned stained glass lantern, a glowing finely woven silver mesh cage of fireflies, and an opaque ruby red glass door are here.

You enter a large room with items of all sorts arranged neatly in mahogany and gold-trimmed glass display cases. Deep amber velvet curtains, set against rich royal blue walls, are opened wide to let in light from the street. A large candlelit crystal chandelier hangs from the ceiling, illuminating the room with dazzling color. Beside the large arched double doors are two display cases which stand out amongst the rest. Plush burgundy chairs and mahogany coffee tables are throughout the store to sit and look around in comfort, or perhaps join a friend for a bite to eat from a neighboring store. A light scent of spicy incense fills the room, and the warm ambience lends itself to a rich shopping experience. Some of the items for sale are mundane, yet necessary parts of everyday life, while others have more exotic uses and origins. The shopkeeper, with a friendly smile, is ready to sell ones every desire.   A pair of large arched double-doors, a closed display case and sign, and a closed display and placard are here.

All along North Merchant Avenue shops, homes and offices are built in the shadow of Spur's inner west wall. Snippets of conversation from the guards above filters down to the clean, tended cobblestone roadway.  Above an old weathered door is a sign reading, "General Store".  The old shop, a staple of the Merchant District, occupies a newer bribrick building, replacing the old wooden fire trap.

Snippets of conversation from the guards above filters down to the clean, tended cobblestone roadway.  Above an old weathered door is a sign reading, "General Store".  The old shop, a staple of the Merchant District, occupies a newer bribrick building, replacing the old wooden fire trap.

Behind a tall counter a well-dressed female with a short beard takes new orders and scurries to retrieve items for pickup. Behind her, industrious Hithuals work at several forges, filling the stout building with noise and smoke. Specializing in the repairing of old damaged equipment for adventurers, their services are in high demand. Their quality and quick turn over has earned them enough coin to garner one of the prime locations in the Spur.  A giant iron anvil, a wooden sign, and a heavy mahogany door are here.

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.  A marble statue of a Human, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a rosewood sign, a crisp gold lettered vellum notice, a flowing white marble fountain, a shimmering marble statue of a Dragon, a short wooden stick, a slightly dented brass buckler, and a tattered old book of notes are here.

Dismal Lane continues on a crooked path north and south. A side street branches to the west and is quickly lost in the shadows. A ramshack looking building that seems to be almost leaning sideways stands out on the corner, a small dented sign hangs from above the swinging wooden doors that reads, "Tarnished Tankard Tavern and Inn". From the look of the patrons milling around outside, this is anything but a high class establishment.  A pair of broken swinging wooden doors are here.

Dismal Lane continues on a crooked path north and south. A side street branches to the west and is quickly lost in the shadows. A ramshack looking building that seems to be almost leaning sideways stands out on the corner, a small dented sign hangs from above the swinging wooden doors that reads, "Tarnished Tankard Tavern and Inn". From the look of the patrons milling around outside, this is anything but a high class establishment.  A pair of broken swinging wooden doors are here.

Dismal Lane meanders along between crowded buildings. Some appear to be uninhabited with windows and doors boarded over. Many of the other buildings have undergone some refurbishment and are fronted by freshly painted doors and windows. Around the base of the trees that have been planted along the street someone has planted rings of daisies. On the side of the street, a gang of young Thugians taunt a human child, pushing him back and forth. There is neither fear nor anger on the child's face, only dull, apathetic acceptance.  An open blue door, a scented lilac tree, a scented lilac tree, and some cheerful yellow and white daisies are here.

Potholes and cracks in the road impede travel on this portion of Low Street. Maintenance is not considered a priority, due to the roads distance from the center of the city. Unimpeded by the poor condition of the street, several people gather around a nearby newsstand, reading the latest issue of the Spurian Free Press and discussing politics. Across the street from the newsstand a sign next to a weathered brown wooden door reads, "Spurian Free Press" in large, bold letters.

Low Street is the thoroughfare that carries people to the northwestern portion of Spur. The traffic along this road leans towards those without any viable economic means. Women who look older then their years, crippled old men and darkly clad shadowy figures all move stoically towards their destination. Only the plodding of worn shoes breaks the dismal silence.  A street lantern is here.

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.  A marble statue of a Human, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a rosewood sign, a crisp gold lettered vellum notice, a flowing white marble fountain, a shimmering marble statue of a Dragon, a short wooden stick, a slightly dented brass buckler, and a tattered old book of notes are here.

The path is flanked by countless tall oaks, swaying peacefully in the wind. They do their best to hide the sky from view, making it hard to tell night from day at times. Littering the area are pieces of broken wagon, bits of human remains and dried splotches of blood. The remnants of a violent fight lie all around you, whomever used to belong to the wagon is no more than vulture food.  A bloody severed foot is here.

In the dusty distance, Spur's great wall demarks the southern end of this well-traveled merchant's road. Soaring majestically to the north stands the spiky pinnacles and snow topped peaks of an epic mountain range so immense that it separates lands, races, and cultures. Connecting the two is a merchant road built long ago.

The noise and sputum of the big city stains the south eastern horizon through the vague outline of old-growth oaks, maples and cedars. This well traveled road transverses the flat terrain shouldered by weeds and vines and, due to the proximity of the city, small paths continuously cut through the road from either side.

Lush grass grows up to the borders of a thick, dense forest that cloaks the hills to the west. The grasslands thin near the grove as the huge trees completely shade the ground, and are replaced by taller bushes and juniper trees. The contrast between the waving stalks on the flat vista and the dark leaves of almost vertical trees is striking.

From the west spans a dark green forest of Sycamore and Beech trees that soak in the moister parts of the lower river valley. The tall, shaded forest breaks like a green tinged wave upon the tranquil calm of the grasslands. The huge trees within are ancient, reaching hundreds of feet into the air. As if steaming from a great cauldron, a heavy ground fog seeps from deep within the forest carrying with it the fresh smell of decomposing green matter.

A rickety criss-crossed rough beam fence pens the grazing of black and white cows whose ponderous forms are barely visible through the tall grass on either side of the road. To the north, the soft, undulating grassland floor of the wide valley succumbs to the rolling foothills, which in turn delineates the imposing outline of a vista-spanning mountain range. Many a traveler has witnessed this idyllic vantage point and has been drawn on to follow the road that travels into the heart of the mountains.

The road diverts around a small pool of murky water that lies to the north. A confusion of hoof prints muddies the shoreline where the placid bovines have come to water themselves. The pool is damned by a small hillock which allows no drainage so the pool remains stagnant. The mountains to the north reflect in perfectly upside-down symmetry on the still pond's surface, only wavering slightly in concentric circles to the deft touch of small insects.

Just to the north, the roadway curves gently around a bend in a large river that flows towards the southeast. An enormous smooth round rock splits off a small eddy from the main current resulting a deep, clear pool by the eastern side of the road. The cool calm water catches the reflection of the white snowcapped mountain range further up the valley while the river rushes past towards Spur. Five fishermen recline on folding chairs or against rocks, tethered by the silvery lines of their poles to the fishing hole. Each fisherman is spread evenly around the pool as if held apart by some invisible barrier as they eye the large shadowy fish shapes finning effortlessly against the mild current in the eddy.

Mismatched mortar colors and varying types and cuts of the stone show the extent of the reconstruction made by quick working masons. A few proud workers chiseled their initials and the date into their handiwork, most reading the date of Rinannimas, 6th month, 61st day, year 313. Bright banners flutter in the breeze on both sides of the bridge as if in celebration of its victory over both the river's truculence and sabotage.

A massive stone bridge spans a raging grey tinted river as it runs it's course towards the southeast. The mud around the bridge footings has been churned by wheels of quarry wagons, tracks of sleds bearing block and tackle, shod hooves of draft beasts and booted feet of masons and bridge workers. The newer parts of the huge bridge are obvious due to the contrast in colors of mortar and rock. Bright banners snap briskly in the wind from both ends of the bridge.  A broken wooden wagon is here.

A brown and white osprey soars above the raging river, scanning the water for a meal. Suddenly, it dives down to the surface and snatches a rather large trout from the water.

On the northern edge of the road stands a tall, flat rock. Chipped into the shape of a pillar and abraded to smoothness, it bears the stamped surveyor's mark of the road's builder. The mark's grooved letters are filled with sand and dust and obscured from age, but the arrows delineating north, south, east and west are clear and easy to read. The rest of the stamp is undecipherable and lends mystery to the road's origin.

Boulders stacked in pyramids contained by large timbers stand mutely to the side of the roadway next to an impromptu dump of broken tools, wooden stakes and empty buckets lined with mortar. Deeply grooved sled tracks lead to the east towards the bridge from this part of the road where the flatness of the valley was best suited for the staging area during the bridge's reconstruction. Smooth rectangles of tent foundations still mark their location in a semi circle around a blackened fire ring where the workers and their supervisors lived during it's rebuilding.

The decaying remains of the bridge workers camp sprawls across this flat valley. To house their draft beasts, the workers constructed small stalls and shelters from rickety boards nailed quixotically to the standing trees. Three brass ring topped posts lie sunk into the grasslands turf, to the south, which was most likely used for tethering grazing animals. Between the posts is a rough stone trough that is filled automatically with water by a rickety mechanical wind mill, whirling lazily in the breeze.

Water loving trees hug the river's course through the low lying valley. Giant beech and huge alders vie for the valuable sodden shoreline and shade the understory bushes and ferns from direct sunlight. The result is a lushly green, verdant forest that obscures the river from the view on the road, though the hiss of rushing water reveals it's course.

Running parallel to the road is a smooth rock lined trench that channels the road's run-off during rainstorms. This flat part of the road that follows the valley floor would be prone to turn into a muddy bog and therefore a hazard to most caravans and their pack animals. Anticipating this event, the road's engineers built drains into the lower side of the road that carry the runoff into the culvert, which carries it harmlessly down to the low end of the valley.

The merchant road threads through bottom of the small, narrow valley. Sheer granite walls block the view from the well traveled road to either side and above, only a narrow ray of sky testifies to the time of day. The engineers set a route as far as possible from the broken stones in the center of the valley and, by luck or design, this foresight has saved the road-bed from constant reconstruction. Small cracks run parallel to the road, but none have broken through the thick layers of sand and stone.

Faded marks, where the fountain water used to flow, run down the wolf's chin.  A faded dry stone fountain is here.

[Wolf Trap-Town Square.]

The area around you seems lifeless and empty. Dominating the otherwise bare Town Square is a large fountain. The fountain's base is circular, with the statue of a wolf howling at the moon in the middle. The structure is devoid of water, and the stone has grown faded and bleached from the sun. Faded marks, where the fountain water used to flow, run down the wolf's chin.  A faded dry stone fountain is here.

An underground cavern has been concealed from the town above, and seems to be much more lively than any other place you've encountered. Some townsfolk are sleeping in shabby tents, while others sit in small groups and eye you warily, growing silent as you draw near.  An open trapdoor is here.

An underground cavern has been concealed from the town above, and seems to be much more lively than any other place you've encountered. Some townsfolk are sleeping in shabby tents, while others sit in small groups and eye you warily, growing silent as you draw near.  An open trapdoor is here.

This room is illuminated.
Obvious exits: southeast*.

A small patch of brownish-green grass fills the area. The brush crunches softly beneath your feet. A square shape seems to be carved into the ground...  An open trapdoor is here.

An underground cavern has been concealed from the town above, and seems to be much more lively than any other place you've encountered. Some townsfolk are sleeping in shabby tents, while others sit in small groups and eye you warily, growing silent as you draw near.  An open trapdoor is here.

A few people trade their meager goods with each other at what passes as the Wolf Trap marketplace. Most of the village's children scamper about, snacking on jerky and playing ring games.

Some injured people line up in front of a local healer. For a few dirty silver coins, she heals their wounds. A rocky slope begins to the northeast, where it appears to be more difficult to move.

A tiny alcove to one side of the narrow tunnel holds a pile of ragged, grimy blankets. Does someone actually sleep in this hole?
