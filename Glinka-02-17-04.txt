The current grows strong as you near the midpoint between the riverbank and the sandbar, almost threatening to pull you under.

[Southern Tradeway.]

The tradeway runs across the open grasslands northeast towards the Spur, and southwest towards distant lands and eventually, the coast. The plains to the south and east seem totally indifferent to your existence. Just ahead, a small path moves up a village of huts spread out in a semi-circle. In the center of the village a giant fire pit sits where barbarians who wander through the village can sit around to stay warm.  A worn grassy path is here.

The stone paved tradeway stretches across the open plains, interrupting nature's task of consuming the land. An endless sea of grass surrounds you, lapping at the road much like the tides against a beach. The faintly damp wind occasionally blowing in from the west smells of earth. Some of the stones in the road interlock together to form the crude image of a lion. There is no discerning if it was done on purpose or sheer accident.

Only the well-built, stone tradeway gives any hint of civilization ever having had any presence here. The tall grasses limit visibility nearby, hiding any wildlife that may be waiting for prey to stumble too close. A few blades of grass sway slightly in the breeze, some of them broken by the passing of something heavy over them. One of the larger stones in the road, broken loose from its mortar, waits patiently to be repaired.

The grass rises taller and taller in every direction further limiting view just off the roadside. A second glance reveals that this is the lowest point in a large, shallow depression. The tradeway sinks a little lower as it gets closer to the river off to the west. A ditch runs alongside the river's side of the road, small puddles of water filling the bottom. Trickles filter into the puddles from the grass beyond as mosquitoes dart across the muddy surfaces.

Rising up out of the plains, a large walled fort receives the end of the stone road. The river flows from either side, running through the fort from this angle of view. The vegetation surrounding the tradeway at this point has been burned out recently, allowing a clear field of vision from the tops of the walls ahead. The stones show little wear from the heavy traffic of feet and wheels alike; it has certainly been well constructed.

Two guards patrol above the gate, looking you over carefully before giving leave to pass through the heavy wood gate. Thick and long wooden ladders serve up to the guard's posts high in the sky so that they may have some relief from their duties overlooking the land and city. Through the slates of the wooden walkways, you can make out four archers playing a game of cards, weapons at the ready. A whip cracks loudly as a caravan heads out the gate towards Spur.  A glowing wrought iron lantern is here.

Within the heart of this proud fort one can see all around that the reconstruction of its buildings has begun. Large stones and logs have been stacked and piled, while some workers tirelessly attempt to repair the damage that occurred here during the Lords of Chaos wars. The buildings and homes of the people that resided here are slowly taking shape, though, far from completed. The smell of dyes, used to paint the town, permeate the area.  A breathtaking shimmering bouquet of moonflowers, an open light blue door, and a glowing wrought iron street lantern are here.

Here a gate leads out of the fort and into the Southern regions. Several children run and play just inside the gate, under the watchful eyes of the guards. What was once a very well used trade route has slowed to some caravans bringing supplies for the townsmen and the occasional merchants traveling from the far southern reaches of the land. Many guards protect this section of the fort as it is home to some wild beasts that live outside these walls. In the distance, you can make out two more guards hunting the frogmen that often try to attack the city and caravans.  An open large sturdy wooden gate and a glowing wrought iron lantern are here.

A few guards do a roving patrol of the area and down to the bridge. They check the caravans before they enter and anyone that looks suspicious they throw into the river. They seem quite wary of anyone coming or going to and from the city. From their appearance it would seem best to stay on their good sides and hope that they are in good moods.  An open large sturdy wooden gate and a stone bridge are here.

[Bridge]

With Meetpoint at your heels this rugged old cobblestone bridge leads to the Southern Plains and the main trade routes from spur and Meetpoint to the Southernmost reaches of the lands. Signs that this road was once well traveled by the hustle and bustle of laden carts are plain to view. Though, with the hardened clay-like mud and the fact that it has not rained here in some time it is obvious that these tracks are very old.

An ever-present breeze rustles the leaves of the old, ominous oak trees that the forest path meanders through. A few tall pine trees are sprinkled throughout the expanse of oaks, contributing their needles and cones to the ocassional forest shower of wind dislodged debris. The path continues into the forest to the south, its serpentine nature lending to the ancient forest a means to disguise the final destination.  A path is here.

The forest path requires constant twisting and turning to navigate undeterred through the obstacle course of fallen trunks, thick spider webs, and lush fern and ivy growth. Though not obvious at first glance, a game trail does indeed snake its way through the rotting leaves and pine needles that make up the padded forest floor. A bright red cardinal, frightened by your sudden presence, takes wing and quickly vanishes, consumed by thick greenery all around.

The towering trees of the forest begin their ascension of the large mountain seen from the open plains of New South Lake. The root holds are precarious, as the mountain's face is especially steep on the northern side. The muddy path concludes in front of a sheer stone wall covered with verdant patches of green moss. A numbing breeze blows outward from the depths a massive cavern mouth, as if the mountain itself was exhaling ice-chilled breath. Deep-cut symbols grace the sides of the cavern entrance. They appear to be recently completed, as time, water, and weather have not yet dulled the sharp lines of the cuts.  A massive stone cavern is here.

[Cavern Entrance.]

By swift passage of flood waters, or slow percolating of artesian wells, the towering walls of this sandstone cavern were eroded into eery eliptical shapes, creating an underground network of winding passages. Dozens of misshapen tunnels, chambers, and alcoves start or end in this cavern, their inky black mouths dotting the walls in every direction and height. Apertures in the uneven ground plunge thousands of feet through dripping mists and down into the dark bowels of the earth. Lining the cavern mouth exiting to the forested path are two precisely carved semicircles, one within the other. Their borders are cut several inches deep into the walls and the sandstone has been reenforced with a metallic substance within the double arch. Filling the gaps between the dual arches are deeply gouged draconic runes, glyphs, and wards, each crackling with pent-up azure energy.   A massive stone cavern opening is here.

A steep ramp of tightly packed clay, rocks, and detritus descends into a deep basin formed in the sandstone floor of the cavern. The smooth floor of the basin implies natural formation, but deep claw gouges along the sides, although smoothed by the passage of time, bespeak draconic assistance. From the rim of the basin a phantasmal form is visible. Standing perfectly still at the center of the basin it appears statuesque. A sudden flurry of graceful yet precise movement reveals the apparition to be progressing through a series of increasingly complex fighting stances and maneuvers. Each sharp jab, stab, slash, and cut is demonstrated wielding a gleaming scimitar in one hand and a short curved dagger in the other.   A ramp leading down is here.

The walls of the basin have obvious, deep claw marks, even though time has smoothed their edges. They are decorated with the occasional arrow lodged firmly into the soft sandstone. The smooth striated sandstone floor slopes gradually downward from the high, claw-gouged walls of the circular pit to its center, forming an almost perfect bowl. At the center of the basin the floor levels leaving a flat circle about twenty yards in diameter. The ground bears signs of combat but time and feet eventually wear smooth the shallow scrapes caused by weapons. A steep ramp of tightly packed debris, clay and rocks cuts into the basin, beginning at the upper rim and ending right at the edge of the level circle. A transluscent figure awaits you at the center of the circle.   A ramp leading up is here.

Housed along the western wall of the elongated tunnel are many nooks and crannies, which in turn hold several tomes, books, volumes, scrolls and texts. Large claws, leaving behind tell-tale furrows gouged deep into sandstone, appear to have raked out the crevices. There is no order or organization to the collection; some lay open, some stacked up against each other, and others with torn pages scattered about.  A jagged clawed crevice, a black velvet-lined niche, and a deep misshapen cavity are here.

[Southwestern Recess, Dragon Cavern.]

This dead-end cavern seems almost as if it were scooped out by a giant's hand. The large finger-like gouges in the soft sandstone reveal abstract stripes formed by the different layers of rock and sediment. The soft walls, eroded and convoluted by ancient flood waters, weep a steady stream of purified ground water that dribbles into a huge knife-edged quartz geode dominating the center of the floor. Light refracts off each spiked crystal, causing the water's surface to shimmer and leap strangely. Floating like a chilled fog over a warm pond, a disc of shifting quicksilver hovers over the middle of the pool. Seemingly placid, the quicksilver's thick surface sporadically ripples, morphing into brief glimpses of jewel studded crowns and just as quickly dissolving back into a simple silver disc. The liquid shifts again to form a pile of glittering coins, and then crashes like a broken wave onto its own flat surface.   A quartz lined pool and a floating flat disc of quicksilver are here.

Hollowed by a the passing of molten rock eons ago when the birth of the mountain ranges violently cracked the earth's crust, this obsidian antechamber's beaker shape funnels light like a glass kaleidoscope across acres of glittering gold and gems. The stark black background perfectly offsets each brilliantly faceted, sparkling mixed pile of rubies, emeralds, diamonds, and sapphires. Rich blood red brocades and thick, heavy black velvet line heavy trunks, chests and vaults, tenderly displaying the more delicate gold and platinum worked items, dripping gems linked by hand wrought chains. Solid gold chain-mesh sprawls over gleaming gold and silver hand engraved armor, complete with matching lances, shields and helmets.

The iron-rich smell of blood wafts up to your nostrils, mixed with the overwhelming effluvium of freshly killed prey, seasoned fish, and cured meats. Several dozen carcasses dangle from the ceiling, tethered by rusting iron chains. Along the northern curve of the alcove, several steelwood barrels house various types of fish, crustaceans, and insects in varying states of animation. The bones of many different species are strewn thick along the floor, mixing with the blood from the hanging food to create a hazardous surface to tread upon. A light fog hangs in the air, a result of the natural cold of the buried sandstone mixing with the rising warmth of the most recent additions to create visible tendrils of steam.   A large worn steelwood barrel, a large worn steelwood barrel, and a large worn steelwood barrel are here.

The upper concentric circles of the ledge accommodate several rocks. The large rocks are not made of the abundant sandstone of the caves; rather, they are chiseled obsidian. Most have narrow slits for claw perches, while some are crudely hewn into bowl shapes for seating. Sound reverberates magnificently within the bowl, causing any sound above a whisper to carry to any point in the chamber.

The walls of this sloping tunnel are unlike any other found in the network of caverns. Certain sections of the normally porous sandstone are glossy, almost glass-like. Other parts of the passage appear to have melted and bubbled, leaving behind small craters and fist sized lumps in the rock face. The floor is smooth like red-streaked obsidian, seared by the intense heat that can only be generated by dragon flame.   A round carved sandstone tunnel mouth and a narrow black opening are here.

                                    Visualization #1 is:
As you reach out to grasp a rock to help you turn the corner you notice your fingers have begun to turn blue as a result of the cold, thin air.  The ground here seems to be unstable and your footing is precarious.

                                    Visualization #2 is:
Four sturdy walls and a roof of woven branches enclose this small tavern. From the forest floor, winding their way around the trunk of the Mother Tree, a set of intricately railed steps serve as the entrance and exit of the town of Treehaven. Strangers arriving at the top of the steps find themselves under the watchful eye of patrons seated at tables positioned about the light, airy room. A set of oak steps lead up to the new Council chambers.

                                    Visualization #3 is:
An abundant gallery of paintings depicting sacrifices and hold offerings to their god suspend from crooked iron nails. Resting beside each painting, cold black iron braziers appear to hold burned blood and bone. A few charred, blackened pieces can be found in them. Several iron chains hang along the walls of the sacrificial chamber. Along the floor, intricately placed colored slate tiles are coated in dust covered dried blood. Centering the room is a raised platform accessible through a flight of stairs. Upon this raised formation rests an altar inlaid with rows and rows of teeth.

[Garden, Dragon Cavern.]

The bottleneck widens gradually to reveal a dank underground grotto awash in an otherworldly glow. Drooping tendrilled fungi splotch the striated sandstone cavern ceiling. The thick stalks of the fungi are topped with a head of hundreds of filaments that end with a glowing lavender nodule, giving the entire chamber an eldritch luminescence. A thick carpet of lush burgundy moss blankets the ground and runs up the walls in several instances, thinning into sparse clumps the higher it goes. Where the moss stops its climb, bone-white shelf fungi replaces it; each successive layer jutting further out into the tunnel until reaching the ceiling. Growing in no discernable manner on top of the moss are billowy balloon mushrooms, each easily four feet in radius. Their diaphanous membranes show millions of spores waiting to be exhaled out a small mouth if disturbed. Rounding out the fungal flora are several groups of seven foot tall toadstools, each displaying a dazzling array of shifting fluorescence on their caps.   A large oval sandstone hole in the wall is here.

[Pool, Dragon Cavern.]

From an unseen spout hundreds of feet above, a roaring waterfall spills over and crashes into the chilly, crystal clear waters of a large underground lake. A thick layer of froth radiates outward from the meeting; minute bubbles bursting as they are driven away from the violent clash. Only the farthest shallows are unaffected by the waves and spray the falling column of water creates upon its introduction to the lake's surface. An occasional milky white fin or tail parts the water's surface, before once more diving into the depths of the lake. The thunderous roar of the waterfall is further amplified by the natural acoustics of the vast dome-shaped sandstone chamber.

A steep ramp of tightly packed clay, rocks, and detritus descends into a deep basin formed in the sandstone floor of the cavern. The smooth floor of the basin implies natural formation, but deep claw gouges along the sides, although smoothed by the passage of time, bespeak draconic assistance. From the rim of the basin a phantasmal form is visible. Standing perfectly still at the center of the basin it appears statuesque. A sudden flurry of graceful yet precise movement reveals the apparition to be progressing through a series of increasingly complex fighting stances and maneuvers. Each sharp jab, stab, slash, and cut is demonstrated wielding a gleaming scimitar in one hand and a short curved dagger in the other.   A ramp leading down is here.

The walls of the basin have obvious, deep claw marks, even though time has smoothed their edges. They are decorated with the occasional arrow lodged firmly into the soft sandstone. The smooth striated sandstone floor slopes gradually downward from the high, claw-gouged walls of the circular pit to its center, forming an almost perfect bowl. At the center of the basin the floor levels leaving a flat circle about twenty yards in diameter. The ground bears signs of combat but time and feet eventually wear smooth the shallow scrapes caused by weapons. A steep ramp of tightly packed debris, clay and rocks cuts into the basin, beginning at the upper rim and ending right at the edge of the level circle. A transluscent figure awaits you at the center of the circle.   A ramp leading up is here.

By swift passage of flood waters, or slow percolating of artesian wells, the towering walls of this sandstone cavern were eroded into eery eliptical shapes, creating an underground network of winding passages. Dozens of misshapen tunnels, chambers, and alcoves start or end in this cavern, their inky black mouths dotting the walls in every direction and height. Apertures in the uneven ground plunge thousands of feet through dripping mists and down into the dark bowels of the earth. Lining the cavern mouth exiting to the forested path are two precisely carved semicircles, one within the other. Their borders are cut several inches deep into the walls and the sandstone has been reenforced with a metallic substance within the double arch. Filling the gaps between the dual arches are deeply gouged draconic runes, glyphs, and wards, each crackling with pent-up azure energy.   A massive stone cavern opening is here.

The towering trees of the forest begin their ascension of the large mountain seen from the open plains of New South Lake. The root holds are precarious, as the mountain's face is especially steep on the northern side. The muddy path concludes in front of a sheer stone wall covered with verdant patches of green moss. A numbing breeze blows outward from the depths a massive cavern mouth, as if the mountain itself was exhaling ice-chilled breath. Deep-cut symbols grace the sides of the cavern entrance. They appear to be recently completed, as time, water, and weather have not yet dulled the sharp lines of the cuts.  A massive stone cavern is here.

By swift passage of flood waters, or slow percolating of artesian wells, the towering walls of this sandstone cavern were eroded into eery eliptical shapes, creating an underground network of winding passages. Dozens of misshapen tunnels, chambers, and alcoves start or end in this cavern, their inky black mouths dotting the walls in every direction and height. Apertures in the uneven ground plunge thousands of feet through dripping mists and down into the dark bowels of the earth. Lining the cavern mouth exiting to the forested path are two precisely carved semicircles, one within the other. Their borders are cut several inches deep into the walls and the sandstone has been reenforced with a metallic substance within the double arch. Filling the gaps between the dual arches are deeply gouged draconic runes, glyphs, and wards, each crackling with pent-up azure energy.   A massive stone cavern opening is here.

A steep ramp of tightly packed clay, rocks, and detritus descends into a deep basin formed in the sandstone floor of the cavern. The smooth floor of the basin implies natural formation, but deep claw gouges along the sides, although smoothed by the passage of time, bespeak draconic assistance. From the rim of the basin a phantasmal form is visible. Standing perfectly still at the center of the basin it appears statuesque. A sudden flurry of graceful yet precise movement reveals the apparition to be progressing through a series of increasingly complex fighting stances and maneuvers. Each sharp jab, stab, slash, and cut is demonstrated wielding a gleaming scimitar in one hand and a short curved dagger in the other.   A ramp leading down is here.

The iron-rich smell of blood wafts up to your nostrils, mixed with the overwhelming effluvium of freshly killed prey, seasoned fish, and cured meats. Several dozen carcasses dangle from the ceiling, tethered by rusting iron chains. Along the northern curve of the alcove, several steelwood barrels house various types of fish, crustaceans, and insects in varying states of animation. The bones of many different species are strewn thick along the floor, mixing with the blood from the hanging food to create a hazardous surface to tread upon. A light fog hangs in the air, a result of the natural cold of the buried sandstone mixing with the rising warmth of the most recent additions to create visible tendrils of steam.   A large worn steelwood barrel, a large worn steelwood barrel, and a large worn steelwood barrel are here.

This dead-end cavern seems almost as if it were scooped out by a giant's hand. The large finger-like gouges in the soft sandstone reveal abstract stripes formed by the different layers of rock and sediment. The soft walls, eroded and convoluted by ancient flood waters, weep a steady stream of purified ground water that dribbles into a huge knife-edged quartz geode dominating the center of the floor. Light refracts off each spiked crystal, causing the water's surface to shimmer and leap strangely. Floating like a chilled fog over a warm pond, a disc of shifting quicksilver hovers over the middle of the pool. Seemingly placid, the quicksilver's thick surface sporadically ripples, morphing into brief glimpses of jewel studded crowns and just as quickly dissolving back into a simple silver disc. The liquid shifts again to form a pile of glittering coins, and then crashes like a broken wave onto its own flat surface.   A quartz lined pool and a floating flat disc of quicksilver are here.

Hollowed by a the passing of molten rock eons ago when the birth of the mountain ranges violently cracked the earth's crust, this obsidian antechamber's beaker shape funnels light like a glass kaleidoscope across acres of glittering gold and gems. The stark black background perfectly offsets each brilliantly faceted, sparkling mixed pile of rubies, emeralds, diamonds, and sapphires. Rich blood red brocades and thick, heavy black velvet line heavy trunks, chests and vaults, tenderly displaying the more delicate gold and platinum worked items, dripping gems linked by hand wrought chains. Solid gold chain-mesh sprawls over gleaming gold and silver hand engraved armor, complete with matching lances, shields and helmets.

The smooth floor of the basin implies natural formation, but deep claw gouges along the sides, although smoothed by the passage of time, bespeak draconic assistance. From the rim of the basin a phantasmal form is visible. Standing perfectly still at the center of the basin it appears statuesque. A sudden flurry of graceful yet precise movement reveals the apparition to be progressing through a series of increasingly complex fighting stances and maneuvers. Each sharp jab, stab, slash, and cut is demonstrated wielding a gleaming scimitar in one hand and a short curved dagger in the other.   A ramp leading down is here.

[Circular Pit, Dragon Cavern.]

A winding tunnel opens above a large depression in the cavern floor. A wide ledge spirals its way down the contour of the circular pit, narrowing as it approaches the flat bed of the bottom. The upper concentric circles of the ledge accommodate several rocks. The large rocks are not made of the abundant sandstone of the caves; rather, they are chiseled obsidian.

A steep ramp of tightly packed clay, rocks, and detritus descends into a deep basin formed in the sandstone floor of the cavern. The smooth floor of the basin implies natural formation, but deep claw gouges along the sides, although smoothed by the passage of time, bespeak draconic assistance. From the rim of the basin a phantasmal form is visible. Standing perfectly still at the center of the basin it appears statuesque. A sudden flurry of graceful yet precise movement reveals the apparition to be progressing through a series of increasingly complex fighting stances and maneuvers. Each sharp jab, stab, slash, and cut is demonstrated wielding a gleaming scimitar in one hand and a short curved dagger in the other.   A ramp leading down is here.

By swift passage of flood waters, or slow percolating of artesian wells, the towering walls of this sandstone cavern were eroded into eery eliptical shapes, creating an underground network of winding passages. Dozens of misshapen tunnels, chambers, and alcoves start or end in this cavern, their inky black mouths dotting the walls in every direction and height. Apertures in the uneven ground plunge thousands of feet through dripping mists and down into the dark bowels of the earth. Lining the cavern mouth exiting to the forested path are two precisely carved semicircles, one within the other. Their borders are cut several inches deep into the walls and the sandstone has been reenforced with a metallic substance within the double arch. Filling the gaps between the dual arches are deeply gouged draconic runes, glyphs, and wards, each crackling with pent-up azure energy.   A massive stone cavern opening is here.

The towering trees of the forest begin their ascension of the large mountain seen from the open plains of New South Lake. The root holds are precarious, as the mountain's face is especially steep on the northern side. The muddy path concludes in front of a sheer stone wall covered with verdant patches of green moss. A numbing breeze blows outward from the depths a massive cavern mouth, as if the mountain itself was exhaling ice-chilled breath. Deep-cut symbols grace the sides of the cavern entrance. They appear to be recently completed, as time, water, and weather have not yet dulled the sharp lines of the cuts.  A massive stone cavern is here.

With Meetpoint at your heels this rugged old cobblestone bridge leads to the Southern Plains and the main trade routes from spur and Meetpoint to the Southernmost reaches of the lands. Signs that this road was once well traveled by the hustle and bustle of laden carts are plain to view. Though, with the hardened clay-like mud and the fact that it has not rained here in some time it is obvious that these tracks are very old.

A few guards do a roving patrol of the area and down to the bridge. They check the caravans before they enter and anyone that looks suspicious they throw into the river. They seem quite wary of anyone coming or going to and from the city. From their appearance it would seem best to stay on their good sides and hope that they are in good moods.  An open large sturdy wooden gate and a stone bridge are here.

Here a gate leads out of the fort and into the Southern regions. Several children run and play just inside the gate, under the watchful eyes of the guards. What was once a very well used trade route has slowed to some caravans bringing supplies for the townsmen and the occasional merchants traveling from the far southern reaches of the land. Many guards protect this section of the fort as it is home to some wild beasts that live outside these walls. In the distance, you can make out two more guards hunting the frogmen that often try to attack the city and caravans.  An open large sturdy wooden gate and a glowing wrought iron lantern are here.

Within the heart of this proud fort one can see all around that the reconstruction of its buildings has begun. Large stones and logs have been stacked and piled, while some workers tirelessly attempt to repair the damage that occurred here during the Lords of Chaos wars. The buildings and homes of the people that resided here are slowly taking shape, though, far from completed. The smell of dyes, used to paint the town, permeate the area.  A breathtaking shimmering bouquet of moonflowers, an open light blue door, and a glowing wrought iron street lantern are here.

Two guards patrol above the gate, looking you over carefully before giving leave to pass through the heavy wood gate. Thick and long wooden ladders serve up to the guard's posts high in the sky so that they may have some relief from their duties overlooking the land and city. Through the slates of the wooden walkways, you can make out four archers playing a game of cards, weapons at the ready. A whip cracks loudly as a caravan heads out the gate towards Spur.  A glowing wrought iron lantern is here.

Rising up out of the plains, a large walled fort receives the end of the stone road. The river flows from either side, running through the fort from this angle of view. The vegetation surrounding the tradeway at this point has been burned out recently, allowing a clear field of vision from the tops of the walls ahead. The stones show little wear from the heavy traffic of feet and wheels alike; it has certainly been well constructed.

The grass rises taller and taller in every direction further limiting view just off the roadside. A second glance reveals that this is the lowest point in a large, shallow depression. The tradeway sinks a little lower as it gets closer to the river off to the west. A ditch runs alongside the river's side of the road, small puddles of water filling the bottom. Trickles filter into the puddles from the grass beyond as mosquitoes dart across the muddy surfaces.

The tall grasses limit visibility nearby, hiding any wildlife that may be waiting for prey to stumble too close. A few blades of grass sway slightly in the breeze, some of them broken by the passing of something heavy over them. One of the larger stones in the road, broken loose from its mortar, waits patiently to be repaired.

Some of the stones in the road interlock together to form the crude image of a lion. There is no discerning if it was done on purpose or sheer accident.

The stones of the road are smoothly set together, well built to withstand heavy travel. A broken wagon wheel, discarded some time ago, covers a spot of nearby grass, weeds trying to climb through the spokes.

[Noble Way.]

Noble Way continues to wind its way among the rather modestly sized, but elegant, homes of the Spur's successful. Many a peasant farmer may live in homes larger than these, but none can match the quality found here. A peaceful, luxurious feeling pervades this part of town; perhaps it is the drifting floral scents wafting from the well-tended gardens.  A closed elegant black iron gate and a street lantern are here.

[Noble Way.]

Many grand, even ostentatious, homes line this stretch of Noble Way. Most of the residents here were fortunate enough to be born into the right families. Few that live in this area have ever actually had to work for a living. Glancing at the nameplates reveals many of the recognizable names of the Spur. Some of these names could almost be considered famous.  A street lantern is here.

An unusually large home, even for this part of town, lies off to the west. It seems as if one ambitious owner is slowly buying up the lots next to his and adding them to his own. Groundskeepers are at work in the surrounding gardens, trimming and raking, so intent on their work they do not bother to acknowledge the passing traffic on the road.  A street lantern is here.

To the north, you can make out an ornately scrolled gateway set in the base of the imposing city wall. The refined roadway of Noble Way stretches out to the south. The cobblestones of the road are smooth and even. The attention to detail shown here is a dramatic change from some of the other parts of the city.  A street lantern is here.

[Gateway.]

An elegant, carved wooden sign hangs above the ornate gateway set into the massive wall that divides Spurs Noble District from the Town Square. You can make out city guardsmen peering down attentively at all that approach from their posts atop the imposing wall. They seem to take a greater interest in this part of town, though there does not seem to be anything threatening enough here to warrant such attention.  A gilded silver plaque and a street lantern are here.

Standing next to the large iron gate that separates the center of town from those of the elite class are several of the Spurian Guard. They are here to assist all who pass with the simple kindness of opening a gate, or the more important task of escorting those in need to the bank or market. A young looking cadet rubs wax into the stones of the city wall, his task is daunting, but one that will teach him discipline.  An open iron gate and a street lantern are here.

[Southern Avenue & Gorey Street.]

The boughs of a large apple tree hang over the well tended avenue. Below the beautiful tree stands a small fountain. Atop the fountain is an intricately carved Secian who appears to be dancing with the water as it splashes around her. Set in the marble base is a small plaque that reads, "For those who have gone before us." Many stand for a moment as they pass this way, giving thanks for the gift of life that is given by both the apple tree and the Secians of long ago. Large piles of dirt and broken stone lay on either side of the street as workmen ready the east and west alleys for expansion.  A street lantern, a Secian etched moonsilver door, a pair of open silver forged swinging doors, and a sign above the doors are here.

Vast estates tower over the huge Spurian wall towards the south. The well-to-do who live in these homes idle away their days, enjoying the luxury of time. Standing next to a very empty lantern pole, a small Flerian child insists in a plaintive wail, that he had nothing to do with the missing lantern. The well-dressed guard that interrogates him keeps pointing at a small sack on the ground and its obvious contents.  An open small burlap sack and a street lantern are here.

Southern Avenue leads between the center of Spur and the homes of the prosperous and wealthy. Several of the Ladies of the city stroll along the avenue chatting about the current events and latest gossip of the Spur. Behind them, harried servants carry their reticules and all those belongings that they cannot be without.  A street lantern is here.

[Town Square South.]

The outward appearance of the people here seems a bit classier. Rich clothing and large coin purses are prevalent amongst the travelers. In fact, many of the folk heading into Town Square from the south are accompanied by large bodyguards to assure their safety. The well maintained road is lined with small brass lanterns, each swinging off an individual pole. No expense has been spared to keep those who travel this road safe from the hoodlums that relish the darkness.  A street lantern and some charred foliage are here.

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.   A flowing white marble fountain, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a cracked marble statue of a Human, a carved marble statue of a Dragon, a rosewood sign, a small jagged cobblestone crack, a welcome mat, and a short copper knife are here.
