Compared to the road to the east, the ground is very wet. A small stream of mud flows down the middle of the street, bridged by planks of wood.

Two elegant buildings, one to the north and one to the west, stand on either side of a quickly degrading road. Nattily dressed patrons of the two establishments hurry to their destination, not pausing for fear of being robbed, or worse. To the northwest the houses steadily become more decrepit. A dark pallor of smoky air hangs heavily over the area.  A street lantern and a heavy mahogany door are here.

A darkly clad hoodlum leans against a worn street sign. He eyes those who pass by very carefully and then makes a few gestures into the shadows. All who are forced to travel upon this road have learned to keep one hand on their coin purse, the other on their weapon, and their wits about them.  A faded wooden sign and a glowing street lantern are here.

Low Street is the thoroughfare that carries people to the northwestern portion of Spur. The traffic along this road leans towards those without any viable economic means. Women who look older then their years, crippled old men and darkly clad shadowy figures all move stoically towards their destination. Only the plodding of worn shoes breaks the dismal silence.  A street lantern is here.

A beggar lies in a large pile of trash snoring deeply. His clothing is torn, filthy dirty, and a strong smell of alcohol wafts off of him. Sniffing around in the garbage, a hound looks for any scrap that can be eaten. The pup nudges the beggar and begins to rummage through the trash that he is using for bedding.  A street lantern is here.

Potholes and cracks in the road impede travel on this portion of Low Street. Maintenance is not considered a priority, due to the roads distance from the center of the city. Unimpeded by the poor condition of the street, several people gather around a nearby newsstand, reading the latest issue of the Spurian Free Press and discussing politics. Across the street from the newsstand a sign next to a weathered brown wooden door reads, "Spurian Free Press" in large, bold letters.   A street lantern, an open weathered brown wooden door, and a wooden newsstand are here.

Low Street ends at a gate that stands permanently ajar, its mechanism jammed and broken. Set in the massive city walls between Town Square and Spur's Poor Quarter, the gates rickety appearance befits that which lies behind it. Loud and colorful words, mixing with the sound of playing children can be heard from within.  An open iron gate and a street lantern are here.

Magnificent in decoration, the Fifth Stage beckons all to enter, to savor the sweet, delicious smells coming from within. A sign across the building front advertises the coming grand opening. Save a few minor touchups of paint, the restaurant looks to be one of the most attractive buildings in not only the poor quarter, but Spur as well.  A closed intricately carved oak door, a wooden sign, and a pair of antique wrought iron street lamps are here.

Two workers argue on the rooftop far above, an occasional shout of "I did the last one. It's your turn" reaching your ears.

Looming high into the air, a cathedral dome caps a single large building. Ringing the top edges of the roof, statues of masked figures hold eternal poses.

Another street branches off on the north side of Dank Street. The south side of Dank Street is lined with pawn shops. Above each door is a sign bearing three globes.

Islands of red light illuminate gaudily dressed figures that beckon you with silibant whispers and sickly smiles.

Compared to the road to the east, the ground is very wet. A small stream of mud flows down the middle of the street, bridged by planks of wood.

The flow of mud seems to come from a cul-de-sac to the north. Many of the houses have fallen and shacks have been built on their sites, from the wreckage. Other wreckage is being used to shore up the walls of those houses still standing. Fights continually break out among house-dwellers and shack-dwellers over how precious wood is to be used.

The vagabonds, homeless, and street dwellers have moved on, leaving the business establishment alone. Several townsfolk mill about as they await the opportunity to throw away some of their coin in the hopes of being a lucky winner. An occasional Thugian bouncer leans out the door, looks around and then closes the door again. Just to the right of the door, a brand new placard has been placed upon the wall.  An open highly polished maple door and an elegantly etched bronze placard are here.

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.   A flowing white marble fountain, a marble statue of a Human, a highly polished marble statue of a Dragon, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a giant bunch of yellow and white daffodils, a rosewood sign, and a broken faintly glowing amber skull are here.

[Town Square Center.]

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.   A flowing white marble fountain, a marble statue of a Human, a highly polished marble statue of a Dragon, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a giant bunch of yellow and white daffodils, and a rosewood sign are here.

This area is illuminated.

[Town Square North.]

The traffic on the northern street heading away from town square is an eclectic bunch.  Those who belong to the guilds to the north travel in packs on their way to and from guild events.  It is not unusual to see a group of armored fighters passing a group of robed clerics, each heading in the opposite direction. The large temple of Rinanni rises to the north, its white marble almost glowing in the light.  A street lantern is here.

Beds of wildflowers line the carefully placed cobblestones along this street. A pair of love birds, cooing in delight, sit upon a white marble bench. The giggles and laughs of a pair of trysting lovers echoes from the room in the Traveler's Hostel to the east. It is certain that Rinanni looks down upon this scene with delight.  A white marble bench and a street lantern are here.

A peaceful bliss pervades the very core of this guilded path. Below a large oak tree a couple of Rinannian priestesses sing lightly in Secti. Several merchants pause to listen to the song. Even a few hardened warriors cannot help but smile at the sweet melody.  A large oak tree, an open dragon-etched emerald door, and a street lantern are here.

The distant glimmer from a temple made of white marble and pearl catches your eye. An intricate gilded iron gate and a small winding path are all that separate you from the dazzling temple of Rinanni. Majestic marble statues of doves in flight stand on either side of the gate. The gaze of their peaceful eyes seems to follow your every movement.  An open intricately gilded iron gate, a pair of pure white marble dove statues, and a street lantern are here.

A large stone building rises just to the east of Northern Avenue. These barracks house those known as Dread Knights. It is not unusual to see patrols of this elite group heading down the street towards Town Square. One would hope their presence would allow everyone to live in peace. If only they would stop fingering their swords all the time, you might believe it yourself.  A street lantern is here.

[Northern Avenue.]

Northern Avenue ends at a gateway set within the massive city walls. On the other side of the gate are the Guild Halls. Those who pass through accept the bond of peace that the Guilds impose on all who desire their services. On either side of the gate guards stand at attention saluting all those who pass by.  An open iron gate, an open thick stone door, and a street lantern are here.

The city walls tower high above you at the entrance to the guild district. On top of the wall, a very bored looking guard with a lazy eye watches those passing through the gate. The large guild buildings spread out around the district, bustling with the day-to-day activity of the city's guild groups.  An open iron gate and a street lantern are here.

The massive building of the Merchant's Guild looms over a vast part of the guild district. The activity at the main door of the guild is mind numbing as hundreds of citizens and merchants alike rush in and out of the guild to handle their business. While the governor has control over the city guard, many claim it is the Merchant's Guild that runs the city of Spur.  An open exquisite polished mahogany door and a street lantern are here.

To the south the road runs back into the center of the city, further to the north the city road continues on toward the other guilds. All the legal city guilds are represented within this city district except for the Forester's Guild. A sign stands beside the road to help direct lost would-be foresters to their guild hall.  A beautiful etched wooden sign and a street lantern are here.

Numerous citizens walk purposefully along the busy street. Fighters and mercenaries make up the majority, but some from almost all walks of life hurry past as well. A dejected street cleaner struggles to keep up with the messes left behind by the pets and other beasts that travel on the roads.  A street lantern is here.

Northern Avenue meets Art Avenue at this intersection. Further to the north, the Mercenary's Guild makes its home, while the Bard's and Sage's Guilds are to the east. The extravagant Merchant's Guild stands to the south. Various sponsors wave pieces of parchment in an attempt to recruit new members.  An open lustrous hammered steel door and a street lantern are here.

The sounds of clashing steel and the calls of battle fill the air near the entrance to the Mercenary's Guild. Numerous hardened warriors lean up against the walls of the building waiting for job offers, while others move in and out of the guild hall going about their daily business. By the looks of it, some of the veterans are giving a barbarian near the front door a hard time.  An open white cedar door and a street lantern are here.

A narrow steel gate leads through a short white stone wall. Beyond the gate lies the practice yard for the Mercenary's Guild. Novice mercenaries sit or stand outside the gate, either resting from their exertions or gathering their courage to enter. Piles of old bandages lie beside the road. Behind the practice yard, the incredible outer wall stands high above the city.  An open polished oak door, a street lantern, and an open narrow grey steel gate are here.

The tangy-sweet smell of metal and leather permeate the air of this shop. A stout Hithual wearing a leather apron barks an order to a young apprentice who lets out a yelp and rushes to the back of the shop to carry out his master's wishes. The shopkeeper mumbles about lazy youngsters and returns to oiling a fine looking leather weapon harness, leaving you to examine his wares on your own.   Some glowing quartz faced copper lanterns and an open polished oak door are here.
