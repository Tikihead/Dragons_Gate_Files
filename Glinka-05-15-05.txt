[Marble Tower, Ball Room.]

Floating within this massive marble edifice are stars and moon shaped orbs bouncing high above on unseen air currents. A silvery tapestry adorning the far wall depicts Spurian History, woven with the finest threads of pale blue, amber, green, and hues of red. Delicate chimes ring in the air, as an enchanting melody plays softly, calming even the most tempestuous spirit. Standing within the confines of this beautiful marble tower, gives the impression that one stands within history itself, looking out at the future through the celestial heavens of the New Year.  A beautiful marble bridge, a raspberry chocolate martini, and a cup of lightly sugared mixed fruit are here.

[Marble Tower, Ball Room.]

Floating within this massive marble edifice are stars and moon shaped orbs bouncing high above on unseen air currents. A silvery tapestry adorning the far wall depicts Spurian History, woven with the finest threads of pale blue, amber, green, and hues of red. Delicate chimes ring in the air, as an enchanting melody plays softly, calming even the most tempestuous spirit. Standing within the confines of this beautiful marble tower, gives the impression that one stands within history itself, looking out at the future through the celestial heavens of the New Year.  A beautiful marble bridge, a cup of lightly sugared mixed fruit, some vomit, and a fluted glass of champagne are here.

This room is illuminated.
You see the 1st black and brown gryphon (wearing a small gold collar) and the 1st pair of mischievous ferrets (wearing a small gold collar).

A silvery tapestry adorning the far wall depicts Spurian History, woven with the finest threads of pale blue, amber, green, and hues of red.

Standing within the confines of this beautiful marble tower, gives the impression that one stands within history itself, looking out at the future through the celestial heavens of the New Year.  A beautiful marble bridge, a cup of lightly sugared mixed fruit, some vomit, and a fluted glass of champagne are here.

A silvery tapestry adorning the far wall depicts Spurian History, woven with the finest threads of pale blue, amber, green, and hues of red. Delicate chimes ring in the air, as an enchanting melody plays softly, calming even the most tempestuous spirit.

The cobblestone path winds its way between lush trees that bloom tiny white flowers. A gentle breeze blows through the area, causing the buds to shake and flutter softly onto the ground. Boisterous laughter can be heard echoing from within two large cottages which causes the pathway to fork to the southwest and southeast. Above one door, a sign reads "The Bounty Bar," and above the other there is a sign that reads "The Bounty Dining Hall." A few children lean lazily against one of the building structure, sipping on glasses of raspberry fizz and chocolate milk as they wait for their parents. An adolescent drag-al, grinning from ear to ear, darts out of the tavern holding a bottle of champagne, grabs his friend and drags him quickly to the southeast.

Travelers from Rathan to the northwest, and the Trade Route to the south, converge at Spur's west gate. Guards posted on the ground give those seeking to enter the city a cursory once-over. Their lack of interest shows that anyone approaching has already been observed from above for some time. A grate in the ground loosens mud from wagon wheels and hooves before they pass through the gate, helping to keep the streets of Spur fairly clean.  An open giant black iron gate, a giant green oak tree, a small blue pool, a thick oak grate over the pool, a polished stone marker, a flaming glass covered memorial candle, a flower covered marble arch, and a flaming glass covered memorial candle are here.

The relative safety inside Spur is a comfort to those returning from the fields and mountains. To those leaving, a massive wall of defense around the city lies ahead. Archer towers beside the gate overlook the wall, offering a painful welcome to would-be invaders. Several guards on foot patrol pass and disappear behind a thick, bluesteel banded steelwood door. Wall road stretches to the south, a wide passage between the city wall and several large buildings.

A path to the north winds its way among various stalls and tents. Some specialty outlets can be found, provided one does not get lost in this maze known as the Bazaar. More permanent structures to the south suggest finer goods as well as increased security.  A street lantern and a flaming glass covered memorial candle are here.

Many townsfolk pass along this busy thoroughfare. Rich and poor alike mix freely on this street, much to the dismay of a passing nobleman. A young human struggles with an armful of packages and two young children in tow. Those in need of goods or supplies head west towards the market, those looking for the news of the day head east towards Town Square.  A street lantern and a flaming glass covered memorial candle are here.

A large gate separates the Merchant District and Town Square-the hub of Spur's activity. The partially opened gate is currently able to accommodate the simultaneous passage of several locals and visitors, but can be expanded to accept carriages, or sealed to ward against invasion.  Guards stand sentry from atop the wall as well as the ground.  A street lantern and a flaming glass covered memorial candle are here.

Merchant Walk comes to an abrupt end at a massive moonsilver gate. The towering walls of Spur on either side of the gates force all to pass by the guards who are constantly on the watch for thieves and bandits. Just beyond the gates one can glimpse the bustling Merchant District of Spur.  A gilded oak sign, a street lantern, and a flaming glass covered memorial candle are here.

Several city guardsmen have just finished wrestling to the ground some young tough thieves, who thought to rob one of the returning merchants. To one side a relieved-looking Fir Elf gentleman holds on tightly to his gold-tipped walking stick, as the human boy yells his innocence to any who might listen. His pleas fall on deaf ears as the guards drag him away.  A street lantern and a flaming glass covered memorial candle are here.

Merchants, some in frilly finery, others dressed in homespun wools, travel back and forth along this street on their way to and from work. They seem to blend together here, if only briefly. Several of the more haughty looking merchants are trailed by overloaded carts pushed along by haggard young apprentices.   A street lantern and a flaming glass covered memorial candle are here.

A neatly kept park fronts this portion of Merchant Walk. Topiary and low shrubberies partition off small sections of the park. Young lovers sit on benches almost hidden from view, gazing at each other with looks of love, oblivious to the continual bustle of passing customers and merchants on their way to do business.  A street lantern and a flaming glass covered memorial candle are here.

People carrying bundles stream in from the west and rapidly lose themselves in the large crowds moving about in the vast town square.

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.   A flowing white marble fountain, a marble statue of a Human, a highly polished marble statue of a Dragon, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a giant bunch of yellow and white daffodils, and a rosewood sign are here.
