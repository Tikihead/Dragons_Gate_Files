The chipped bark path widens to encompass a broad square between the peaked roofs of the village homes, the larger storefronts, and several communal buildings that all surround a magnificent fountain crafted from local sandstone. The multi-tiered fountain flows with pure, clean springwater and provides seating around its broad base.  The towering trees surround the village, enclosing the square in a living frame.  To the west is a sturdy building with its door perpetually ajar. A line of Leuian children trots off towards the north, bearing their lessons. The faint ding of nautical bells flows in on the breeze from the northwest.   A flowing gold-flecked sandstone fountain, a thin silver steelhead fish, a long red and yellow steelhead, and a long red and yellow steelhead are here.

An immense, smoothed river boulder deposited by the river, eons ago, is imbedded in the soft loam of the forest floor and blocks the view of the river to the north. A few giant trees have grown bent around its rounded shape and an innovative homeowner has taken advantage of the resulting shelter. Built carefully among the trees in the lee of the rock, stands a magnificent example of the same peaked wooden beam homes that dot the entire forest. One fledgling tree pokes its head through a well-planned hole in the roof.  A pair of closed magnificent carved steelwood doors, a slippery downhill path, and a stack of rocks are here.

The houses grow more abundant as the path meanders further around the park. Rows of homes border the park and stretch back amongst the low hills towards the inner part of the island.

Two Leuian adolescents chat and laugh amongst themselves as they casually stroll down the path to the pier, kicking a stone between them.  Some sandy wooden steps are here.

[Protected Cove.]

Beyond the embrace of the forest, a warm golden sand beach has gathered in the backflow of a protected cove. Above, fern fronds, vines, and the exposed roots of the giant conifers dangle over the edge of a short steppe that protects the village from floods.  A walkway created by dual rows of pitch torches lead to a large, communal sand pit. Circling the pit are several large logs evenly spaced for those who come to catch the night's events or simply sit and relax.   Some sandy wooden steps, a cool clear lagoon, a blazing crackling fire pit, a fish shaped copper platter, a finely woven reed placemat, an open linen lined reed bread basket, an open ice filled oak drink chest, a smooth pearlescent glass bowl, a copper handled reed dessert tray, a red and white linen covered picnic table, a long red and yellow steelhead, a thin silver steelhead fish, and a long red and yellow steelhead are here.

Staroph says in Leuian, "We can not hope to improve our group for the better if we have no respect for each other, and most importantly, our selves. Faults need to be fixed within our people before we can think of worrying about how others perceive us."

Staroph says in Leuian, "Just a few words from a daft old man, something to think about for everyone."

Staroph smiles smugly as he moved to resume his previous spot in the circle.

Staroph sits down with a soft thud, relaxing..

Staroph says in Leuian, "Done."

[Protected Cove.]

Beyond the embrace of the forest, a warm golden sand beach has gathered in the backflow of a protected cove. Above, fern fronds, vines, and the exposed roots of the giant conifers dangle over the edge of a short steppe that protects the village from floods.  A walkway created by dual rows of pitch torches lead to a large, communal sand pit. Circling the pit are several large logs evenly spaced for those who come to catch the night's events or simply sit and relax.   Some sandy wooden steps, a cool clear lagoon, a blazing crackling fire pit, a fish shaped copper platter, a finely woven reed placemat, an open linen lined reed bread basket, an open ice filled oak drink chest, a smooth pearlescent glass bowl, a copper handled reed dessert tray, a red and white linen covered picnic table, a long red and yellow steelhead, a thin silver steelhead fish, a long red and yellow steelhead, and an empty warm glass of fresh milk are here.

Staroph raises an eyebrow slowly, clearly not amused.

Talishia says, "i nod my head to many kyn.. because to me.. i have never had kyn.. Kenetic has talked to me about this before, respectfully, and i have tried my best to greet kyn in a friendly manner."

Kenetic smiles.

Tiruna smiles at Talishia.

Talishia says, "it is not for lack of respect or to show that one is not equal to me, it is simply.. bowing, and curtsying is painful.. i have many scars. .ones i do not show to many people. if i bow to you, it is a deeper respect because i will endure that pain to"

Talishia says, "greet you in a manner more fitting"

Talishia says, "when meeting new kyn, ones i do not know very well, i am nice, and friendly.. smile, and yes, nod, many times a hug or a laugh. "
wh to hot It would have been more respectful of Staroph to let the khatyra finish her mention of war than to start this yes?
You whisper to Hott in Leuian.
>
Talishia says, "to be called a tarr, or city khat because i choose to make a diffrent greeting then is normal... does not earn my respect. and continued will earn me simply ignoring someone"

Talishia furrows her brow as she looks around.

Hott whispers in Leuian, "yes but he from old times"
nod to hot
You nod to Hott.

Lthe smiles.

Your mind begins to fill with the sounds of tiny voices!

Tiruna smiles at you.

Hott hugs Talishia.
[Forest Fringe.]

Few tall trees can root in the sandy soil so near the river bank.  Scraggly waterberry bushes tenaciously hold to the shifting loam between the smoothed river boulders riddled with cracked quartz and feldspar.  An obscured path leads into the darker fringes of the forest and up the steppe to the village.
