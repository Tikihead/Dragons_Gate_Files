Hiding behind the shadow of the moon, numerous trees and tent tops, a small village wears the black veil of night as it nestles itself behind the aura the eclipsed hour. A narrow trail ribbons itself through a forest maze of lifeless trees that frame the wayside of a rolling river. The wind fills the air with the scent of burning wood as its beckoning call echoes the eerie cry of howling wolves. Amidst the glowing light of lanterns, shady figures parade and dance through the heavy velvet blanket of night.  Some tall creepy oak trees, a glowing strand of star-shaped lights in the trees, a swirling vortex of shadows, and a decrepit faded wooden sign are here.

The wind whines a slow, lingering song as a cobblestone path winds itself up to the entrance of a warping thatched roof cabin.  A festive old man smoking a pipe, a glowing orange candle in a jar, some decaying red leaves on the ground, an open round shaped wooden door, a black and white chocolate swirl frosted cookie, and a black and white chocolate swirl frosted cookie are here.

A misty trail of white smoke slinks steadily in coiled rings from a stone chimney that hardly balances on the slanted rooftop. A silver trimmed owl rests like an ancient sentinel on the stacked stones. Its golden eyes reflect the halo of the full moon. Shrilled laughter mixed with eerie cries of terror carry on the hasty wind as saloon-type door swings on its hinges by unseen hands.  A crooked swinging saloon-type door is here.

This small town wears the black veil of night as it nestles itself behind the shadows of the eclipsed moon. A narrow trail of dust and broken flagstones ribbons itself through a maze of lifeless trees and old buildings. The wind fills the air with the scent of burning wood as its beckoning call echoes the eerie cry of howling wolves. Amidst the glowing light of lanterns, shady figures parade and dance through the heavy velvet blanket of the shadowed moon.  Some flowing black and orange silk streamers, a glowing wooden bonfire, a nebulous shadow statue, a pumpkin patch, a decrepit wooden sign, and an ominous twisted opal arch are here.

The sweet, spicy scent of burning wood carries on the air, giving warmth to the stinging chill of the rushing wind. To the west, circles of festival goers sit around a bonfire, warming their hands as others wonder back and forth about the festival. The wind whines a slow, lingering song as a cobblestone path winds itself up to the entrance of a warping thatched roof cabin.  A festive old man smoking a pipe, a glowing orange candle in a jar, some decaying red leaves on the ground, an open round shaped wooden door, a black and white chocolate swirl frosted cookie, and a black and white chocolate swirl frosted cookie are here.

A few people stand outside the wagon, bags of candy corn and candied apples within their hands, peering through the wagon door through ornamental masks.

Decorated with fragrant candles and garlands of dried leaves and berries, this small wagon exudes a truly festive feeling. Plush crimson red velvet floor cushions surround a small wooden table, which has intricate autumn scenes carved into its surface. A small stage rests in the northern corner for merchants to show off their wares. A red velvet curtain leads into a smaller room set up for the travelling body artist and hairstylist, while a beaded curtain leads into Broyce's work area.

The inside of the wagon matches the appearance of the outside. The pine walls are termite ridden and are slightly warped to let in the light from the outside. A hodge-podge of miscellaneous items hang from bent nails -- pots, pans, dead ravens, monkey's paws, a bag of newt's eyeballs.... In the center of the room sit two chairs and a wobbly table. Upon the table rests a slightly cracked crystal ball. Strings and wires crisscross around the room, attached to the table, attached to chairs, and one can almost see a few pulleys screwed into the roof of the wagon.  Some star and moon shaped lights on twisted wires, a cobweb laden wooden chair, a cloth covered wooden table, a slightly cracked crystal ball, a cobweb laden wooden chair, a dusty plaid canvas couch, and an old decrepit pine wagon door are here.

The wind whips through the area, stirring up the long skeletal branches of a weeping willow. They sway, reach out towards, and slap against unsuspecting passer-bys.

Sinuous vines twist around the tree trunks and stretch themselves from one tree to the next.  Crimson and orange leaves swirl lightly as a soft breeze blows through. Two of the smaller trees bend towards each other, their upper branches entwining and forming a natural arch. A shimmering spider web curtain hangs from the archway, glowing softly from behind.

A pungent mix of odors assails your senses as you step into the unstable house. Noxious chemical fumes arise from several steaming vats to your left. They combine with the distinctive smell of hot metal that comes from the forge. A complex series of steam powered fans suck the fumes from the vats into several tin tubes in the ceiling, presumably to keep the chemicals from combusting in the forge's heat.  A glowing smoking fiery steel forge dripping slime, a dull blackened iron anvil covered with dust, and an open crooked shack with a red door are here.

As you pass through the planar rift, the world fades away around you. As your vision returns, you notice that you are standing in a small room unlike anything you've seen before. The walls are formed from a black substance akin to darksteel, but the way your eyes refuse to focus on any particular detail implies that there is something more. The planar rift is behind you, offering a chance to escape back into the world of daylight. Wispy black mist envelops everything here, and although you can see perfectly, there is no visible source of illumination. It is as if this strange world is locked in permanent twilight, casting shadows across your vision but not preventing you from seeing. Set in one of the walls is a door, formed from a dusky grey variant of the shadow material. This is your last chance to turn back. Through that door, the Test begins.  A glowing wispy black mist, a closed dusky grey darksteel door, an IMPORTANT NOTICE, a list of RULES, and an open broken crooked iron gate are here.

Wispy black mist envelops everything here, and although you can see perfectly, there is no visible source of illumination. It is as if this strange world is locked in permanent twilight, casting shadows across your vision but not preventing you from seeing. Set in one of the walls is a door, formed from a dusky grey variant of the shadow material. This is your last chance to turn back. Through that door, the Test begins.  A glowing wispy black mist, a closed dusky grey darksteel door, an IMPORTANT NOTICE, a list of RULES, and an open broken crooked iron gate are here.

The street comes an abrupt end here. A substantial building once stood at the end of the street, but all that remains now is a broken gate leading into an expanse of worm-ridden timber and rubble. Whatever was here, it doesn't seem anyone intends to rebuild as weeds have overgrown everything.  An open broken crooked iron gate is here.

The wind whines a slow, lingering wail as the dirt path winds itself around a rocky corner, where the path meets the entrance of a peculiar shack with a crooked red door. At the step of the door, two carved pumpkins glow with a soft yellow light. Black shadows march across the facade of the building like a parade of ghoulish creatures of the night as tall and small figures in costume pass the small house.  A tall oak leafless tree, a muddy puddle, an open crooked shack with a red door, and a pair of vine-covered pumpkins are here.

Flitting from flower to flower, tiger-striped butterflies dance and swirl through the rich air of the season. A small group of Secians sit beside the billowing ivory tent drinking from the trumpet-shaped flower of sweet honeysuckle. Gardens of vibrantly adorned flowers and trees encircle the small tent in a ring of snapdragons, tiger lilies, mimosa, and lilacs. Taunting, splashing and laughter erupts from inside the tent which sets at the southeast corner of the winding path.

Children and adults alike stand in line, some shivering from wetness after being dunked in the tank, awaiting their turn to dunk their friends and even their enemies. Slick wooden planks make up the foundation of the huge water tank that stands in the middle of this area. Tall glass panels rise up and enclose hundreds of gallons of crystal-clear water, giving a perfect glimpse into the depths of the tank itself. High above the water is a tiny chair on which an unfortunate soul can only sit and await a contestant with good aim to hit the tiny wooden target, only to be sent with a splash into the chilly water below.  A giant glass plated wooden dunking tank, a wooden bucket, a wooden bucket, a wet moldy wooden HOW TO sign, an ominous twisted opal arch, and a creepy black spider are here.

Dark figures glide through the lingering darkness while the shopkeep, and customers alike, scrutinize all who enter. The floor creaks slightly under the weight of peoples footsteps as they walk towards the counter at the rear of the store.

A high pitched cackle rings madly from behind a large iron door. Large white sheets with painted faces dangle from the ceiling, as a cool draft and a silvery mist blows in from the creaking blood red wooden door. Bales of hale are scattered across the dusty floor as patrons await their surgery. An extremely tall, lanky fellow stands beside the iron door, insisting that he was once the size of a Secian.

A silver mist swirls above crushed brown grass and seeps into a small cottage set between skeletal trees through the shoddy crafted door. The door barely hangs onto the frame, swinging open with an echoing creak and closing with a hollow bang as the wind howls. Branches of trees, like claws, whip through the wind and tap upon the broken windows of the cottage.  Some bales of hay, a large grinning pumpkin, and an open crooked red wooden door are here.

A serpentine trail of red mist spirals about a glorious marble fountain. A steady stream of murky water pores steadily from a carved marble pumpkin held in the hands of a rider upon a ghostly horse. Black and orange silk streamers, twisting and swirling in the wind, decorate on a creaking wrought iron fence. Three old women, dressed in shanty black robes, stand around a black cauldron chanting a curse to all who dare to enter the maze.  A glowing carved orange jack-o-lantern, a bubbling jet black iron cauldron, a glowing light orange moonstone lantern, and a closed wrought iron fence are here.

He dashes off down a muddy path leading to the ruins of an ancient elliptical-shaped Coliseum.  Some mud splotched paper streamers and a slippery muddy path are here.

An old gray haired woman sits on a giant rocking chair, rocking back and forth slowly as she stares out a small dusty window. She cackles dramatically as if lost in a bizarre daydream, before she begins to hum a bizarre tune off key.  The notes fall and rise in an eerie melody, as the woman's glazed pale blue eyes roll inward and outward as she slowly weaves another stitch. Large satin-lined boxes sit on a long table, filled with odd and novel costumes of the season.  An open cobweb laden wooden door, a pile of firewood, a wooden Gypsy mannequin, a wooden Ghost mannequin, a wooden Executioner mannequin, a wooden Fairy mannequin, a wooden Cat mannequin, a wooden Pirate mannequin, a wooden Mummy mannequin, and a wooden Dragon mannequin are here.

The boughs of a large apple tree hang over the well tended avenue. Below the beautiful tree stands a small fountain. Atop the fountain is an intricately carved Secian who appears to be dancing with the water as it splashes around her. Set in the marble base is a small plaque that reads, "For those who have gone before us." Many stand for a moment as they pass this way, giving thanks for the gift of life that is given by both the apple tree and the Secians of long ago. Large piles of dirt and broken stone lay on either side of the street as workmen ready the east and west alleys for expansion.

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.  A flowing white marble fountain, a marble statue of a Human, a shimmering marble statue of a Dragon, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a rosewood sign, a crisp gold lettered vellum notice, and a thick misty grey patch of swirling fog are here.

[Festival of Shadows, Ghost Town.]

This small town wears the black veil of night as it nestles itself behind the shadows of the eclipsed moon. A narrow trail of dust and broken flagstones ribbons itself through a maze of lifeless trees and old buildings. The wind fills the air with the scent of burning wood as its beckoning call echoes the eerie cry of howling wolves. Amidst the glowing light of lanterns, shady figures parade and dance through the heavy velvet blanket of the shadowed moon.  Some flowing black and orange silk streamers, a glowing wooden bonfire, a nebulous shadow statue, a pumpkin patch, a decrepit wooden sign, an ominous twisted opal arch, a closed small bright orange pumpkin-shaped purse, a small opal-eyed jackal figurine, and a braided shadowy circle of serpents are here.

The sweet, spicy scent of burning wood carries on the air, giving warmth to the stinging chill of the rushing wind. To the west, circles of festival goers sit around a bonfire, warming their hands as others wonder back and forth about the festival. The wind whines a slow, lingering song as a cobblestone path winds itself up to the entrance of a warping thatched roof cabin.  A festive old man smoking a pipe, a glowing orange candle in a jar, some decaying red leaves on the ground, and an open round shaped wooden door are here.

A yellow leafed maple tree with strong arms hangs languidly over a festively painted gypsy wagon.The voices of various merchants echo from within the wagon, barely audible over the chatter of enthusiastic festival goers. A few people stand outside the wagon, bags of candy corn and candied apples within their hands, peering through the wagon door through ornamental masks.  An open billowy painted wooden wagon door, a large colorful maple tree, some bales of hay, some glowing vine-covered pumpkins, and an old decrepit pine wagon pulled by mules are here.

Hiding behind the shadow of the moon, numerous trees and tent tops, a small village wears the black veil of night as it nestles itself behind the aura the eclipsed hour. A narrow trail ribbons itself through a forest maze of lifeless trees that frame the wayside of a rolling river. The wind fills the air with the scent of burning wood as its beckoning call echoes the eerie cry of howling wolves. Amidst the glowing light of lanterns, shady figures parade and dance through the heavy velvet blanket of night.  Some tall creepy oak trees, a glowing strand of star-shaped lights in the trees, a swirling vortex of shadows, and a decrepit faded wooden sign are here.

A winding serpent-coiled shadowglass table, some runesilk covered oak high backed chairs, a jackal-etched black marble dance floor, a five-man orchestra, some flaming shimmering floating sweet scented candles, an open jackal painted wooden box, a closed jackal painted wooden box, a jackal flanked shadowglass arch with opal serpents, a swirling vortex of stars, a swirling grey fog, a broken creepy black spider, some vomit, and some cheese covered butternut squash are here.

[Festival of Shadows, Haunted Forest.]

Hiding behind the shadow of the moon, numerous trees and tent tops, a small village wears the black veil of night as it nestles itself behind the aura the eclipsed hour. A narrow trail ribbons itself through a forest maze of lifeless trees that frame the wayside of a rolling river. The wind fills the air with the scent of burning wood as its beckoning call echoes the eerie cry of howling wolves. Amidst the glowing light of lanterns, shady figures parade and dance through the heavy velvet blanket of night.  Some tall creepy oak trees, a glowing strand of star-shaped lights in the trees, a swirling vortex of shadows, and a decrepit faded wooden sign are here.

The wind whines a slow, lingering song as a cobblestone path winds itself up to the entrance of a warping thatched roof cabin.

The boughs of a large apple tree hang over the well tended avenue. Below the beautiful tree stands a small fountain. Atop the fountain is an intricately carved Secian who appears to be dancing with the water as it splashes around her. Set in the marble base is a small plaque that reads, "For those who have gone before us." Many stand for a moment as they pass this way, giving thanks for the gift of life that is given by both the apple tree and the Secians of long ago. Large piles of dirt and broken stone lay on either side of the street as workmen ready the east and west alleys for expansion.

The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.  A flowing white marble fountain, a marble statue of a Human, a shimmering marble statue of a Dragon, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a rosewood sign, a crisp gold lettered vellum notice, and a thick misty grey patch of swirling fog are here.

By torchlight or daylight, the windows of this shop sparkle from the many faceted stones inside. The sight almost makes one forget the presence of two Thugian guards and their war dogs guarding the entrance. The etched window glass indicates this is Fredriquede Tiffany's place of business, widely regarded as the finest jeweler in the land.  An engraved marble plaque and an open banded steelwood door are here.

An arch between two large buildings connects Market Circle and Market Street. The more reputable shopkeepers do business within the circle, but pay higher taxes for the privilege. The buildings have been built to last, as these merchants are no traveling tinkers. Interlocking stone walkways and colorful plantings span this central area. Despite the number of animals waiting outside the bank for their owners, the area is spotless. Loud chatter in many languages can be heard from the southwest.  A marble archway, an open elegant gold-trimmed walnut door, and a wooden sign are here.

Situated between the well-traveled Trade Way to the north and the fine shops of Market Circle to the south, this small stretch of road is busy at all times of day. Adventurers with sacks of plundered goods leave Market Street and head west where a shrewd businessman has set up shop in this busy area of the Market District. A small shop stands slightly to the east of the arch leading into Merchant Circle, light shining through its red glass door and illuminating the store front in a cheerful, ruby glow.  A street lantern, an opaque ruby red glass door, and a gold lettered wooden sign are here.

The buildings of Market Circle stand to the south. It becomes obvious that the area through the arch is a much cleaner marketplace than the bazaar. An inviting eatery stands beside the road, its door open to those weary after a long trip to Spur, as well as those preparing to venture to the great expanses beyond the west gate. A human couple exit the building, arm in arm. A small sign stands beside the intersection.  A sign, an open glossy lacquered oak door, and a street lantern are here.

This well-worn road separates the Bazaar to the north and Market Circle to the south. Only a Thugian could appreciate the layered odors of simmering foodstuffs and shoppers from the Bazaar. Crowds of people push past, some brushing against you. It might be a good idea to keep an eye on your coinpurse.  A street lantern is here.

Many townsfolk pass along this busy thoroughfare. Rich and poor alike mix freely on this street, much to the dismay of a passing nobleman.

A large gate separates the Merchant District and Town Square-the hub of Spur's activity. The partially opened gate is currently able to accommodate the simultaneous passage of several locals and visitors, but can be expanded to accept carriages, or sealed to ward against invasion.  Guards stand sentry from atop the wall as well as the ground.  A street lantern is here.

Merchant Walk comes to an abrupt end at a massive moonsilver gate. The towering walls of Spur on either side of the gates force all to pass by the guards who are constantly on the watch for thieves and bandits. Just beyond the gates one can glimpse the bustling Merchant District of Spur.  A gilded oak sign and a street lantern are here.

Several city guardsmen have just finished wrestling to the ground some young tough thieves, who thought to rob one of the returning merchants.

His pleas fall on deaf ears as the guards drag him away.  A street lantern is here.

Merchants, some in frilly finery, others dressed in homespun wools, travel back and forth along this street on their way to and from work. They seem to blend together here, if only briefly.

A neatly kept park fronts this portion of Merchant Walk. Topiary and low shrubberies partition off small sections of the park.

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.  A flowing white marble fountain, a marble statue of a Human, a shimmering marble statue of a Dragon, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a rosewood sign, a crisp gold lettered vellum notice, and a thick misty grey patch of swirling fog are here.

[Festival of Shadows, Ghost Town.]

This small town wears the black veil of night as it nestles itself behind the shadows of the eclipsed moon. A narrow trail of dust and broken flagstones ribbons itself through a maze of lifeless trees and old buildings. The wind fills the air with the scent of burning wood as its beckoning call echoes the eerie cry of howling wolves. Amidst the glowing light of lanterns, shady figures parade and dance through the heavy velvet blanket of the shadowed moon.  Some flowing black and orange silk streamers, a glowing wooden bonfire, a nebulous shadow statue, a pumpkin patch, a decrepit wooden sign, and an ominous twisted opal arch are here.

The sweet, spicy scent of burning wood carries on the air, giving warmth to the stinging chill of the rushing wind. To the west, circles of festival goers sit around a bonfire, warming their hands as others wonder back and forth about the festival. The wind whines a slow, lingering song as a cobblestone path winds itself up to the entrance of a warping thatched roof cabin.  A festive old man smoking a pipe, a glowing orange candle in a jar, some decaying red leaves on the ground, and an open round shaped wooden door are here.

The wind fills the air with the scent of burning wood as its beckoning call echoes the eerie cry of howling wolves.

Attached to the ceiling by strands of braided gold chain, myriads of shimmering sweet scented candles float high above your head.  The flickering light is reflected in the glossy floor.  Next to the east wall, a winding, serpent-coiled table begins and encircles the black marble dance floor. An elegant golden candelabra sits at the serpent head of the coiled table. Surrounding the table are lavish runesilk padded high backed, comfortable chairs. On the west wall is an archway composed of pillars of glistening black glass.  A winding serpent-coiled shadowglass table, some runesilk covered oak high backed chairs, a jackal-etched black marble dance floor, a five-man orchestra, some flaming shimmering floating sweet scented candles, an open jackal painted wooden box, a closed jackal painted wooden box, a jackal flanked shadowglass arch with opal serpents, a swirling vortex of stars, a swirling grey fog, a broken creepy black spider, some vomit, and some cheese covered butternut squash are here.

Hiding behind the shadow of the moon, numerous trees and tent tops, a small village wears the black veil of night as it nestles itself behind the aura the eclipsed hour. A narrow trail ribbons itself through a forest maze of lifeless trees that frame the wayside of a rolling river. The wind fills the air with the scent of burning wood as its beckoning call echoes the eerie cry of howling wolves. Amidst the glowing light of lanterns, shady figures parade and dance through the heavy velvet blanket of night.

You are just inside the gateway between the Justice District and the Town Square. Most of those heading into the Justice District have a grim look about them. Then again, it could just be the chains. A small sign stands off to the side.  An open iron gate, a street lantern, a wooden sign, and a new rosewood sign pointing southeast are here.

[Law Road & Shoteron Way.]

Law Road from the south and Shoteron Way from the east join before turning toward Town Square to the northwest. If one stays at this location long enough, they see the irony of these two roads joining. Most who are escorted south along Law Road are the criminals and ne'er-do-wells of the Spur, while those travel along Shoteron Way are the upper class residents whom live further east. Two office building, the City Planners Office and the Archmage's office stand on opposite sides of the road, each one neatly kept and freshly painted.  A street lantern, an open morbius door, and a new rosewood sign pointing east are here.

A shadowy black twisted free form metal sculpture stands on a small patch of grass at the beginning of Shoteron Way. Its unique design catches the light of both the sun and the moon. Below the memorial are several small items that have been left in passing. The well-manicured cobblestone path shows signs that it is well traveled, and gives enough room for even a large cart to pass the memorial easily.  A street lantern and a closed solid mahogany office door are here.

A low hedge grows between the Spurian Wall and the street. Flowers bloom on the hedge, and cheer up what might be a dreary view. Two guards lean over the tall wall and call down greetings to those who pass. At any time of the day, one may pass a Fir Elf on the way to market, or a Hithual stumbling home to sleep.  A street lantern, an open large wrought iron gate, and a bright new sign pointing east are here.

Three small trees intertwine their branches to form a makeshift play area for the local children. Clinging to the branches, they giggle and call out to each other.

Modestly elegant homes can be seen down Xavier Avenue. A tall blonde stands at the corner home, the silhouette of her figure illuminated by a lantern set deliberately on a table behind her. As she catches your eye, she slowly removes a single piece of clothing, dropping it at her feet. The curtain languidly closes, to the noticeable sighs and audible gasps of those traveling down the street.  A street lantern and a new rosewood sign pointing south are here.

Well-tended yards and carefully trimmed hedges mark the houses that reside down this elegant street. The homes are painted with light colors and have many windows, a striking contrast to those residences down Xavier Avenue and Darkened Elm Road.  A street lantern is here.

Shoteron Way ends with the Spurian Wall on both the north and east, and Darkened Elm Road stretching off to the south. A large twisted elm grows at the corner point where the walls meet, its odd shape having formed from the strange place it was planted. Misshapen branches reach towards the dark street, eerily pointing the way for those who inhabit the homes down the road.  A street lantern and a closed plain walnut door are here.

[Darkened Elm Road.]

The road ends suddenly, a crude barricade preventing passage further south. The southern city wall stands a good distance away, so there is a lot of unused space in between. Elm leaves clog a rusted grate on the road. On the wooden porch fronting a small shack to the west, an old Human woman sits in an old chair. She pets her black cat, humming an odd, eerie tune.  A closed heavily carved ebony door, a closed iron studded steelwood reinforced door, and a closed serpent etched shadowglass door are here.

Built from beautifully polished dark walnut and separated by thin lines of bronze, the flooring of this house is built for beauty as much as functionality. Intricate opal inlay work decorates the marble pillars that support the vaulted ceilings of the foyer. In the center of the room sits a highly-detailed golden statue of a serpent-headed lock-pick. Its glinting opal eyes seem to scan everything that enters through the doorway. A few windows overlook the surrounding areas, however, the thick silken curtains allow only enough light in to give the room a light glow.  A closed scratched worn tin lock-pick bin and an open serpent etched shadowglass door are here.

A beautiful yet extremely comfortable tiger-skin couch dominates the center of the room. Luxurious imported rugs, made of the finest wool and silks line the floor from wall to wall.

                                    Visualization #1 is:
A Temple. The Temple. Not surrounded by satellite buildings of faith, but part and parcel of the bustling city life. Archways and buttresses soar toward the heavens, creamy white marble reflecting all light.

                                    Visualization #2 is:
The dark grey granite walls and ceiling of this room are covered with soot where torches have been allowed to gutter out. Only one torch remains lit next to a stairway leading up. One large, thick-paned window overlooks a walled enclosure below, though the soot on the window prevents any clear view of what is down there. Across from the window, a bookcase filled with scrolls, tomes and jars reaches all the way to the ceiling.  A long worktable holds more scrolls and jars containing assorted specimens. 

                                    Visualization #3 is:
An abundant gallery of paintings depicting sacrifices and hold offerings to their god suspend from crooked iron nails. Resting beside each painting, cold black iron braziers appear to hold burned blood and bone. A few charred, blackened pieces can be found in them. Several iron chains hang along the walls of the sacrificial chamber. Along the floor, intricately placed colored slate tiles are coated in dust covered dried blood. Centering the room is a raised platform accessible through a flight of stairs. Upon this raised formation rests an altar inlaid with rows and rows of teeth.

A narrow alley leads between two tall elms to the west.  A closed arched leather bound iron door is here.

                                    Visualization #1 is:
A Temple. The Temple. Not surrounded by satellite buildings of faith, but part and parcel of the bustling city life. Archways and buttresses soar toward the heavens, creamy white marble reflecting all light.

                                    Visualization #2 is:
The dark grey granite walls and ceiling of this room are covered with soot where torches have been allowed to gutter out. Only one torch remains lit next to a stairway leading up. One large, thick-paned window overlooks a walled enclosure below, though the soot on the window prevents any clear view of what is down there. Across from the window, a bookcase filled with scrolls, tomes and jars reaches all the way to the ceiling.  A long worktable holds more scrolls and jars containing assorted specimens. 

                                    Visualization #3 is:
An abundant gallery of paintings depicting sacrifices and hold offerings to their god suspend from crooked iron nails. Resting beside each painting, cold black iron braziers appear to hold burned blood and bone. A few charred, blackened pieces can be found in them. Several iron chains hang along the walls of the sacrificial chamber. Along the floor, intricately placed colored slate tiles are coated in dust covered dried blood. Centering the room is a raised platform accessible through a flight of stairs. Upon this raised formation rests an altar inlaid with rows and rows of teeth.

[Gateway.]

You are just inside the gateway between the Justice District and the Town Square. Most of those heading into the Justice District have a grim look about them. Then again, it could just be the chains. A small sign stands off to the side.  An open iron gate, a street lantern, a wooden sign, and a new rosewood sign pointing southeast are here.

Right Street ends at a gateway leading to the Housing and Administration District. Those living in this portion of town travel comfortably either by conveyance or by foot. Beautiful flowers grow on both sides of the well tended, freshly painted gate. In front, standing crisply at attention, a Guard tips his hat in greeting to all those who pass.  An open iron gate, a street lantern, and a new rosewood sign pointing southeast are here.

A large wagon sits on the side of the street, its load having shifted and then toppled over. A Usil driver yells at his two Oog-ra helpers, explaining to them that the armoire should be sitting upright and not on its side. They scratch themselves in confusion, and you can hear them muttering something about leaving it on its side, so it does not fall again. There will be a resident who is unhappy with their purchase this evening.  A street lantern is here.

A neatly trimmed hedge with a small strip of grass fronts the road that travels between the Spurian Housing District and the center of town. A well dressed Frontacian woman hurries along the path as two immaculately dressed Guards lead a criminal towards the jail. She sniffs in a haughty manner, and tips her hat down so she does not have to view the filth of the city.  A street lantern is here.

The elegant Hotel Royale towers above the street, its emerald door sparkling in the light. The patrons that stroll in and out are catered to, doors opened and closed for them, and baggage and packages carried by harried servants. The large Bank of Spur sits on the east side of the square. Its location close to the Royale is not a coincidence. A gold-trimmed door is proof of the success of this branch of the Spurian bank and those who run it.  An elegant gold-trimmed walnut door, an open emerald steel door, a street lantern, and a new rosewood sign pointing southeast are here.

[Town Square Center.]

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.  A flowing white marble fountain, a marble statue of a Human, a shimmering marble statue of a Dragon, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a rosewood sign, a crisp gold lettered vellum notice, and a thick misty grey patch of swirling fog are here.

The outward appearance of the people here seems a bit classier. Rich clothing and large coin purses are prevalent amongst the travelers. In fact, many of the folk heading into Town Square from the south are accompanied by large bodyguards to assure their safety. The well maintained road is lined with small brass lanterns, each swinging off an individual pole.  A street lantern is here.

Southern Avenue leads between the center of Spur and the homes of the prosperous and wealthy.

Vast estates tower over the huge Spurian wall towards the south. The well-to-do who live in these homes idle away their days, enjoying the luxury of time. Standing next to a very empty lantern pole, a small Flerian child insists in a plaintive wail, that he had nothing to do with the missing lantern. The well-dressed guard that interrogates him keeps pointing at a small sack on the ground and its obvious contents.  An open small burlap sack, a street lantern, and a lantern are here.

[Southern Avenue & Gorey Street.]

The boughs of a large apple tree hang over the well tended avenue. Below the beautiful tree stands a small fountain. Atop the fountain is an intricately carved Secian who appears to be dancing with the water as it splashes around her. Set in the marble base is a small plaque that reads, "For those who have gone before us." Many stand for a moment as they pass this way, giving thanks for the gift of life that is given by both the apple tree and the Secians of long ago. Large piles of dirt and broken stone lay on either side of the street as workmen ready the east and west alleys for expansion.  A street lantern, an open Secian etched moonsilver door, a pair of open silver forged swinging doors, and a sign above the doors are here.

Standing next to the large iron gate that separates the center of town from those of the elite class are several of the Spurian Guard. They are here to assist all who pass with the simple kindness of opening a gate, or the more important task of escorting those in need to the bank or market. A young looking cadet rubs wax into the stones of the city wall, his task is daunting, but one that will teach him discipline.  An open iron gate and a street lantern are here.

An elegant, carved wooden sign hangs above the ornate gateway set into the massive wall that divides Spurs Noble District from the Town Square. You can make out city guardsmen peering down attentively at all that approach from their posts atop the imposing wall. They seem to take a greater interest in this part of town, though there does not seem to be anything threatening enough here to warrant such attention.

An unusually large home, even for this part of town, lies off to the west. It seems as if one ambitious owner is slowly buying up the lots next to his and adding them to his own. Groundskeepers are at work in the surrounding gardens, trimming and raking, so intent on their work they do not bother to acknowledge the passing traffic on the road.  A street lantern is here.

Noble Way continues to wind its way among the rather modestly sized, but elegant, homes of the Spur's successful. Many a peasant farmer may live in homes larger than these, but none can match the quality found here.

Gazing down each of the nearby private drives reveals a glimpse of a luxurious home, each a miniature estate in its own right.

Leaving the exceptionally wealthy estates of the Spurian nobility, Noble Way heads toward the Town Square to the northwest.

Numerous trees lining the avenue serve as the dividing border between the majestic estates of the nobility and the lightly traveled roadway.

The occasional locked gate marks the entrance to some of the more hidden estates of Spurs nobility. From this broad avenue, little can be seen of their splendor. Behind the imposing gate recedes a proud drive, disappearing mysteriously into the trees. If not for the large imposing tower rising above the hedges it would be hard to discern anything was beyond the gate. It is apparent the residents do not wish to be disturbed.

Through the gate lies the city of Spur, the major center of trade and civilization on the plains. The dusty road leading through the gates is well traveled, and walls of the city are in good repair. A small shack sits to the west of the road, during most times of the day a dusty coach can be seen waiting in front, its horses stomping with impatience to be gone. To the right of the door is a small window, its opening covered with metal bars. An old man, missing most of his teeth, waits patiently for the travelers to pay their fare, and then directs them into the waiting area. On the east side of the road a billowing multicolored tent has been erected, the hustle and bustle of merchants and customers can be seen coming and going at all times of the day.

A hedge of spiky brambles forms a natural division from the lands and the swampy terrain to the south. Tall, limbless trees dot the horizon there, their bases lost in the misty depths of the gases hovering over the waters. Now and then a strange, growling sound echos up to the north, or an odd, high-pitched call of some unseen crow, probably feasting on a fallen creature hidden in the mists. The path curves away from the sounds, as popular choice has preferred to travel around the edges, rather than through the marshy sludge.

Circling around the northern base of a small hill, there lies the lapping edge of the swamp to the south. Small slimy creatures lie on the smooth stones near the water, darting into it at the speed of light as you near them with tiny splashes and echoing wakes blending into the small, gentle waves coming into the shore. Swarms of mosquitoes move along the land in unison, lending them the appearance of large, unified bodies hovering around for the next feast.

Their footprints can be seen occasionally, leading back and forth across the path, sometimes following along the edges, bringing to mind the vision of something that might be following you, at this very moment, leaving tiny or perhaps not so tiny footprints along the edge of the road as it stalks its prey.

Ravens dark as pitch spread their feathers to a wing-span of nearly four feet, so large they are, as they quarrel over an abandoned mule carcass on the roadside breaks out. How final death seems, so casually nature simply encompasses the bodies of the fallen, through carrion hunters or moldy decay. Yet through death there be life again, any number of these ravens being sustained through this death, so they may live. Perhaps only to become sustenance for one of the swamp creatures, who, in turn, spends its life continuing the cycle.

A small orb of light hovers in the center of the path before you, only to disappear as you near it, reappearing further away into the swamp. Stepping near the orb to investigate closer only causes it to again blink out of existence, forming once more, deeper into the mists. It soon becomes apparent that the mysterious lights are attempting to slyly lead you into the swamp. To or for what purpose, is the question.

The smell of freshly cut lumber fills the large lobby of the newly finished bank.  The roof is a collage of intertwined branches and their leaves from above, with a delicately crafted wooden lattice frame set with glass panels just beneath.  The trunk of the Mother tree serves as the back wall of the bank, with the tellers sitting at booths just in front of it.  Some finely crafted wooden stairs are here.

The branches of this tree have begun to grow through the wooden platform. The limbs have begun to twist and turn, forming their own natural base. Soft leaves create a cushion and boast several small buds. The empty remains of an abandoned building is just barely visible between the branches, buried in vines and moss. Intricately crafted stairs lead from the platform to the building that resides in the upper branches.  An open door, some finely crafted wooden stairs, and a painted wooden sign are here.

Leaves and small twigs spot the walkway as it hugs against the trunk of the Mother Tree. New sprouts from the branches above hang softly over the wooden planks, shading it slightly. A large building rests gently against the trunk in the limbs above, nestled as though it grew from within the tree itself.  An oak ladder is here.

Firm wooden planks fit snuggly to create the walkway that extends proudly upon the reconstructed supports. The view of the forest to the northwest is quite panoramic. A staircase here seems to have some enchantment, judging by the strange appearance of unicorns, bears and owls on the lower steps. Strange, due to the fact that they don't appear carved, painted, or placed by any hand-made means. It is as if the glyphs grew into the wood itself. Mysterious symbols are scattered throughout the portraits, which shimmer with a golden whisper as they are approached.

This is the main entrance of a Temple of Elindale, the inside walls perfectly smooth with glowing magickal symbols upon the surfaces. The enormity of this tree becomes apparent as one travels up the stairs to the northwest. The air holds a fresh, new ambiance, pleasantly scented with sweet sap and rich, earthly undertones.  Some glowing magickal symbols and a brown oak staircase are here.

A diminutive niche in the wall provides shelter to a small family of flying squirrels. Just inside sit the young, comfortably settled into the soft bedding the parents have gathered up.

A large tapestry lines the outside wall of the passageway, most impressive in that it is not made of fabric, but of vines as tiny as thick hairs, growing in a weave. The delicate shadings of the plants is perfectly natural, and as the eye becomes unfocused, a picture of a diminutive, beautiful maiden sits amongst a foresty background. The wall opposite of this magnificent tapestry is lined with portraits of prominent temple leaders, the colors vibrant, bringing a life-like sense to the frames. The eyes of the maiden in the tapestry seem to follow you, staring directly as you pass, boring into your soul.  A vellum portrait, a canvas portrait, a suede portrait, a wooden framed oil painting, some unfinished portraits, and a carefully painted silk screen are here.

While the tree appears gigantic from the outside, it still is nothing compared to the impression of being on the inside. Hollow branches large enough to pass a drake branch out here, the surfaces smooth, but in a most curious way. It is apparent that no tools were used to create these passageways, yet there is no evidence to give one the impression that the passageways formed over a long period of time. The branches have grown in this manner intentionally, quite unlike any plantlife found anywhere on the land.

The walls have grown out short, flat surfaces to serve as bookshelves. Small branches spring out of the shelves themselves to provide rests, holding up the many stacks of books collected here. The glory of Elindale can be found, scribed into these pages, as well as other points of interest. Historical novels, books of lore and tomes of knowledge are available for the temple registry to peruse. Any time spent here could prove to teach anyone something they haven't yet learned, or at the very least, one might study the tomes to learn better how to do that which they already know.  An open gilt edged leather book and a smooth oak bookshelf are here.

                                    Visualization #1 is:
A Temple. The Temple. Not surrounded by satellite buildings of faith, but part and parcel of the bustling city life. Archways and buttresses soar toward the heavens, creamy white marble reflecting all light.

                                    Visualization #2 is:
The dark grey granite walls and ceiling of this room are covered with soot where torches have been allowed to gutter out. Only one torch remains lit next to a stairway leading up. One large, thick-paned window overlooks a walled enclosure below, though the soot on the window prevents any clear view of what is down there. Across from the window, a bookcase filled with scrolls, tomes and jars reaches all the way to the ceiling.  A long worktable holds more scrolls and jars containing assorted specimens. 

                                    Visualization #3 is:
An abundant gallery of paintings depicting sacrifices and hold offerings to their god suspend from crooked iron nails. Resting beside each painting, cold black iron braziers appear to hold burned blood and bone. A few charred, blackened pieces can be found in them. Several iron chains hang along the walls of the sacrificial chamber. Along the floor, intricately placed colored slate tiles are coated in dust covered dried blood. Centering the room is a raised platform accessible through a flight of stairs. Upon this raised formation rests an altar inlaid with rows and rows of teeth.
