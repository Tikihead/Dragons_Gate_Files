Huge boulders have created a bowl shaped depression in this sheltered hillock. A stand of scruffy trees continues to eke out a tenuous existence above the rocky outpost; their long tortured roots clinging desperately to what little soil is caught between the boulders. Prevailing winds from the mountaintop have caused the trunks to lean westward, the upper branches creating a canopy over the area.

The stark terrain is impressive in its scope and austerity. One cannot help but feel insignificant and temporary amid the expanse of granite and limestone formed through the millennia. Washed by rain, scorched by the sun and frozen by storms, the rocks endure, a testament to the strength of the Great Divide.

Only the hardiest of life forms hold their own on the rocky steppes. Small cascades of icy water stream down the boulders and darken their surfaces. Tough lichen and scrub pines absorb nutrients from the mineral laden run-off. The sun shines brightly on the southern exposure of the trail, sheltered from the wind and freezing cold. Bright green oases of life sprout from rocky niches and the path is slippery where the green slimy growths cross it.

A carpet of needles covers the path. Pine cones, larger then a Thugian fist, dot the ground. Enormous trees collide with large boulders blocking you from venturing too deep into the overgrown wood.

A makeshift path has been created to circumvent the large tree that has fallen down and blocked the regular path. Lying on its side, the log stands two heads higher then the tallest Thugian.

A strong breeze blows off the mountains of the Great Divide. It both slows your climb and encourages your decent into the valley.

Thankfully, nature has changed the landscape for the better, and has opened a gap through the mountain to the north.

The sound of chirping birds carries far in the mountain air. Their merry singing ends in a frantic pitch as they leave the tree tops and fly away. Under their frantic departure, you hear a faint sound similar to, but not quite, a growl.

The treestumps scattered along the hillside are all that remain of the forest that once prospered here.

[Valley of Ruins, Road.]

This stretch of road is quite unsettling.  You're not sure which bothers you more:  the shadowy presence that you sense to the north, or the eerie force that seems to be calling to the east.  Perhaps these ruins are not so deserted as they once seemed.  A platinum cutlass, a two-handed bronze pike, some gold coins, some silver coins, a two-handed long-spear, and a flowing mysterious cloak of darkness are here.

This area is not illuminated.
You see the 1st black cat (wearing a small gold collar), the 1st gargoyle corpse, the 1st skeletal knight, the 2nd gargoyle, and the 3rd gargoyle.
In the area are Zahra the Noble Leuian, Tiruna the Noble Leuian, Lorimah the Noble Leuian, Rekai the Novice Leuian, Tau the Leuian, Teira the Leuian, Hott the Noble Leuian, Shaleu the Noble Leuian, and Snowball the Leuian.

Perhaps these ruins are not so deserted as they once seemed.  An agate inlaid bronze flagon, a green and white striped mask, a steelwood shield, some worn buckskin archer's gloves, a cheerful yellow and white daisy, a pair of supple tan moccasins, an ice cold platinum ring, an unholy jagged obsidian vulture charm, a pair of satin-lined leather boots, a blue and white striped cup, a platinum cutlass, a two-handed bronze pike, a platinum cutlass, a two-handed bronze pike, and a platinum cutlass are here.

It is hard to be certain what was once here.  Weeds spring up easily between the stones of the floor, and ivy has overtaken the walls.  The plant life seems strangely in place, though.  Perhaps this was once a meditative garden, now gone awry.  A platinum cutlass, a closed enchanting leather pouch, and an open spotted leather bag are here.

This room is illuminated.
You see the 1st black cat (wearing a small gold collar), the 1st black kitten (wearing a small gold collar), the 1st skeletal warhorse corpse, and the 2nd skeletal warhorse.
In the room are Zahra the Noble Leuian, Tiruna the Noble Leuian, Lorimah the Noble Leuian, Rekai the Novice Leuian, Tau the Leuian, Teira the Leuian, Hott the Noble Leuian, Shaleu the Noble Leuian, and Snowball the Leuian.

                        You have visualized the following locations
                        -------------------------------------------

                                    Visualization #1 is:
Through the gate lies the city of Spur, the major center of trade and civilization on the plains. The dusty road leading through the gates is well traveled, and walls of the city are in good repair. A small shack sits to the west of the road, during most times of the day a dusty coach can be seen waiting in front, its horses stomping with impatience to be gone. To the right of the door is a small window, its opening covered with metal bars. An old man, missing most of his teeth, waits patiently for the travelers to pay their fare, and then directs them into the waiting area. On the east side of the road a billowing multicolored tent has been erected, the hustle and bustle of merchants and customers can be seen coming and going at all times of the day.

                                    Visualization #2 is:
Each corner of this square gives entrance to one of the fort's four business establishments. The bank is small, but adequate. The pawnshop and store will see to your buying and selling needs, and the Tarath Wayside Inn is open at all hours to provide shelter for residents and foreigners alike.

                                    Visualization #3 is:
Contrasting starkly with the ashes of the forest and brush is a freshly constructed set of stairs that wraps itself about the large tree. The intricate woodwork that decorates the steps is of the finest quality, as if in parody to the blackened destruction of the hedges and brambles around the base of the trunk. Bright green leaves of clover have begun springing up through the ashy soil in conjunction with soft moss to lend a durable cushion to this well-traveled spot.

Old trees lay side by side with the massive boulders of the mountain, intermingling in a terrible landslide. The mountain top has broken off and slid across the eastern road stopping all forms of transportation. It would take years for mortal hands to remove the tons of stone from the original roadway to make it passable once again. Thankfully, nature has changed the landscape for the better, and has opened a gap through the mountain to the north.

Piles of rubble flank the road on both sides. Some new and some old, this rubble is a mixture of two guard towers and this side of the mountain.

Travelers from Rathan to the northwest, and the Trade Route to the south, converge at Spur's west gate. Guards posted on the ground give those seeking to enter the city a cursory once-over. Their lack of interest shows that anyone approaching has already been observed from above for some time. A grate in the ground loosens mud from wagon wheels and hooves before they pass through the gate, helping to keep the streets of Spur fairly clean.

Four draft horses stomp at the ground in annoyance as two miners struggle with the broken wheel of a horse-cart, filled to the top with glittering dark ore. One heavily muscled Hithual curses fluently in Battle as he attempts to leverage the cart with a plank from its own sideboard. The attempt to thread the axle with a new wheel fails, setting off shouts of pain and frustration.

The city wall stands ominously to the east of the road, an impenetrable mass of stone. Its presence dominates your vision and the road stands in deep, dark shadow until mid-day. Archer towers to the north rise above the top of the wall, indicating the West Gate is near.  A green bush is here.

A trio of Leuian sailors stumble past, returning to the docks. The youngest in the group is being helped along, an arm over each of his partner's shoulders. He mutters something about swabbing decks for the rest of his career. Hearty laughter from the two veterans carries on until the three are out of earshot.

An ork scrambles across the road just ahead of you, squeaking in panic. Arrows from above strike the ground at the creature's heels. The shrieking beast reaches the edge of the tree line and ducks easily under the lower branches of an old Beech. Before disappearing into the forest, it releases a final snort. With a wave and a nod, a Firian guard on the city wall indicates the way is clear.

Tall grasses wave their seed-laden heads in the slightest breeze. Scarred trees bear ancient wounds from wagons wheels and cartage animals. One particular tree bears the marks of hundreds of passers-by. From initials, to messages with dates, the tree marks the passage of time, travel, and the citizens of Spur.  A giant ancient dark steelwood tree is here.

Several San Elves, shackled at the ankles, stand by the road near the corner of the giant city wall. Two guards eye the chain gang carefully, as a harried Usil engineer pores over a set of drawings. Deep ruts have resulted from the persistent erosion. The San actually enjoy this break from their jail time, snickering quietly as they lean on their shovels and pick-axes.

Trees from the southern end of the Oak Woods protrude around the corner of the giant Spurian city wall to the west.

The heavily mired track that left the docks widens out into a maintained thoroughfare carrying the commerce of Spur.

Mud and muck cover the roadway and pier, testament to the high traffic in the area. Men and women unload large cargo ships. Enormous quantities of food come into the city from the docks, and many other goods besides. Goods are moved into the city via the new trade road to the northwest. A pile of lumber stands nearby for future improvements.  A black wooden walkway, an open small oak crate, and an open small oak crate are here.

[Wilderness gate.]

Set within a wide tunnel leading through the hedge to the north is the Wilderness Gate. It separates the settled lands of Spur from the open plains to the south of the city. The plains stretch as far as the eyes can see, the horizon and the walls of the fort down the road the only blemishes of the grassy landscape in the distance. The stones of the road are smoothly set together, well built to withstand heavy travel. A broken wagon wheel, discarded some time ago, covers a spot of nearby grass, weeds trying to climb through the spokes.

The tradeway runs across the open grasslands northeast towards the Spur, and southwest towards distant lands and eventually, the coast. The plains to the south and east seem totally indifferent to your existence. Just ahead, a small path moves up a village of huts spread out in a semi-circle. In the center of the village a giant fire pit sits where barbarians who wander through the village can sit around to stay warm.  A worn grassy path is here.

The stone paved tradeway stretches across the open plains, interrupting nature's task of consuming the land. An endless sea of grass surrounds you, lapping at the road much like the tides against a beach. The faintly damp wind occasionally blowing in from the west smells of earth. Some of the stones in the road interlock together to form the crude image of a lion. There is no discerning if it was done on purpose or sheer accident.

Only the well-built, stone tradeway gives any hint of civilization ever having had any presence here. The tall grasses limit visibility nearby, hiding any wildlife that may be waiting for prey to stumble too close. A few blades of grass sway slightly in the breeze, some of them broken by the passing of something heavy over them. One of the larger stones in the road, broken loose from its mortar, waits patiently to be repaired.

The grass rises taller and taller in every direction further limiting view just off the roadside. A second glance reveals that this is the lowest point in a large, shallow depression. The tradeway sinks a little lower as it gets closer to the river off to the west. A ditch runs alongside the river's side of the road, small puddles of water filling the bottom. Trickles filter into the puddles from the grass beyond as mosquitoes dart across the muddy surfaces.

Rising up out of the plains, a large walled fort receives the end of the stone road. The river flows from either side, running through the fort from this angle of view. The vegetation surrounding the tradeway at this point has been burned out recently, allowing a clear field of vision from the tops of the walls ahead. The stones show little wear from the heavy traffic of feet and wheels alike; it has certainly been well constructed.

Two guards patrol above the gate, looking you over carefully before giving leave to pass through the heavy wood gate. Thick and long wooden ladders serve up to the guard's posts high in the sky so that they may have some relief from their duties overlooking the land and city. Through the slates of the wooden walkways, you can make out four archers playing a game of cards, weapons at the ready. A whip cracks loudly as a caravan heads out the gate towards Spur.  A glowing wrought iron lantern is here.
