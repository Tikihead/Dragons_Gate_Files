Plush, green grass covers the ground. A small babbling brook rises suddenly from the ground then runs through the clearing flowing over smooth stones creating a miniature waterfall which then drains back into the earth. A large garden with rows of vegetables is surrounded by a radiant flowerbed bursting in a riot of colors. Claw footed oak benches are sporadically placed around the garden and brook. Large trees, as tall as the surrounding building, create a canopy for the clearing allowing small rays of sun, as well as, tiny portals to view the twinkling stars with a stunning view of Rinanni's Circle of Promise. On each side of the garden, almost hidden by the dense foliage of the trees, are two grand deep mahogany tufted leather doors etched with the Pride's symbol.  A babbling brook, an open leather door, an open leather door, a small granite cenotaph, an open flaming iron food warmer, a cloth covered serving cart, and an intricately detailed ice sculpture are here.

[The Secluded Garden.]

Plush, green grass covers the ground. A small babbling brook rises suddenly from the ground then runs through the clearing flowing over smooth stones creating a miniature waterfall which then drains back into the earth. A large garden with rows of vegetables is surrounded by a radiant flowerbed bursting in a riot of colors. Claw footed oak benches are sporadically placed around the garden and brook. Large trees, as tall as the surrounding building, create a canopy for the clearing allowing small rays of sun, as well as, tiny portals to view the twinkling stars with a stunning view of Rinanni's Circle of Promise. On each side of the garden, almost hidden by the dense foliage of the trees, are two grand deep mahogany tufted leather doors etched with the Pride's symbol.  A babbling brook, an open leather door, an open leather door, a small granite cenotaph, an open flaming iron food warmer, a cloth covered serving cart, an intricately detailed ice sculpture, a fresh baked apple pie, a frosted mug of Saldean wheat ale, a frosted mug of Saldean wheat ale, a frosted mug of Saldean wheat ale, a frosted mug of Saldean wheat ale, a frosted mug of Saldean wheat ale, a frosted mug of Saldean wheat ale, a frosted mug of Saldean wheat ale, a flowing azure satin noble's cloak, and a frosted mug of Saldean wheat ale are here.

[The Secluded Garden.]

Plush, green grass covers the ground. A small babbling brook rises suddenly from the ground then runs through the clearing flowing over smooth stones creating a miniature waterfall which then drains back into the earth. A large garden with rows of vegetables is surrounded by a radiant flowerbed bursting in a riot of colors. Claw footed oak benches are sporadically placed around the garden and brook. Large trees, as tall as the surrounding building, create a canopy for the clearing allowing small rays of sun, as well as, tiny portals to view the twinkling stars with a stunning view of Rinanni's Circle of Promise. On each side of the garden, almost hidden by the dense foliage of the trees, are two grand deep mahogany tufted leather doors etched with the Pride's symbol.  A babbling brook, an open leather door, an open leather door, a small granite cenotaph, an open flaming iron food warmer, a cloth covered serving cart, an intricately detailed ice sculpture, a frosted mug of Saldean wheat ale, a frosted mug of Saldean wheat ale, a frosted mug of Saldean wheat ale, a frosted mug of Saldean wheat ale, a frosted mug of Saldean wheat ale, a frosted mug of Saldean wheat ale, a frosted mug of Saldean wheat ale, a flowing azure satin noble's cloak, and a frosted mug of Saldean wheat ale are here.

[The Secluded Garden.]

Plush, green grass covers the ground. A small babbling brook rises suddenly from the ground then runs through the clearing flowing over smooth stones creating a miniature waterfall which then drains back into the earth. A large garden with rows of vegetables is surrounded by a radiant flowerbed bursting in a riot of colors. Claw footed oak benches are sporadically placed around the garden and brook. Large trees, as tall as the surrounding building, create a canopy for the clearing allowing small rays of sun, as well as, tiny portals to view the twinkling stars with a stunning view of Rinanni's Circle of Promise. On each side of the garden, almost hidden by the dense foliage of the trees, are two grand deep mahogany tufted leather doors etched with the Pride's symbol.  A babbling brook, an open leather door, an open leather door, a small granite cenotaph, an open flaming iron food warmer, a cloth covered serving cart, an intricately detailed ice sculpture, a frosted mug of Saldean wheat ale, a frosted mug of Saldean wheat ale, a frosted mug of Saldean wheat ale, a frosted mug of Saldean wheat ale, a frosted mug of Saldean wheat ale, a frosted mug of Saldean wheat ale, a frosted mug of Saldean wheat ale, a flowing azure satin noble's cloak, and a frosted mug of Saldean wheat ale are here.

[The Secluded Garden.]

Plush, green grass covers the ground. A small babbling brook rises suddenly from the ground then runs through the clearing flowing over smooth stones creating a miniature waterfall which then drains back into the earth. A large garden with rows of vegetables is surrounded by a radiant flowerbed bursting in a riot of colors. Claw footed oak benches are sporadically placed around the garden and brook. Large trees, as tall as the surrounding building, create a canopy for the clearing allowing small rays of sun, as well as, tiny portals to view the twinkling stars with a stunning view of Rinanni's Circle of Promise. On each side of the garden, almost hidden by the dense foliage of the trees, are two grand deep mahogany tufted leather doors etched with the Pride's symbol.  A babbling brook, an open leather door, an open leather door, a small granite cenotaph, an open flaming iron food warmer, a cloth covered serving cart, an intricately detailed ice sculpture, a frosted mug of Saldean wheat ale, a frosted mug of Saldean wheat ale, a frosted mug of Saldean wheat ale, a frosted mug of Saldean wheat ale, a frosted mug of Saldean wheat ale, a frosted mug of Saldean wheat ale, a frosted mug of Saldean wheat ale, a flowing azure satin noble's cloak, and a frosted mug of Saldean wheat ale are here.

An enormous circle of smooth oak columns create the walls of the Great Room.

Fragrant braided sweet-grass mats are placed randomly around the fire pit. Horn sconces bearing beeswax candles emit a soft light, which permeates the room. A simple, yet elegant redwood plaque adorns the far wall. Carved into this plaque is a dedication. A golden flag is prominently displayed against one wall. Mounted above the grand oak door is a leather banner that has "Walk in Honor" branded into it. A Saldaean crafted, walnut weapons case stands in the corner of the room.

Quietly, a yellow and black bumble bee flies around a small garden of fragrant violet orchids while a small bird eats some seed from a bird feeder hung on the walls of the fort. It is startled by approaching footsteps and flies off towards the northeast. A cool breeze carries the sweet scent of flowers, as the sound of distant fresh running water mumbles the whispered conversations of townspeople.  A closed maple door, a cozy cottage, a closed oak cottage door, a Pride Hall, and an exotic violet orchid box are here.

Within the heart of this proud fort one can see all around that the reconstruction of its buildings has begun. Large stones and logs have been stacked and piled, while some workers tirelessly attempt to repair the damage that occurred here during the Lords of Chaos wars. The buildings and homes of the people that resided here are slowly taking shape, though, far from completed. The smell of dyes, used to paint the town, permeate the area.  A breathtaking shimmering bouquet of moonflowers, an open light blue door, and a glowing wrought iron street lantern are here.

A small man can be seen traveling to and from the sidewalk to the very spot you are at with his hand held out and a look of sorrow in his eyes.

Behind the counter, busily working away, an old Fir Elf is taking the deposits of the travelers passing through. At another counter a young Usil Elf gives the withdraws to the merchants and passersby. The floor is covered with a bluish-green carpeting that appears quite expensive and hardly scathed by the feet of wanderers.

Two guards patrol above the gate, looking you over carefully before giving leave to pass through the heavy wood gate. Thick and long wooden ladders serve up to the guard's posts high in the sky so that they may have some relief from their duties overlooking the land and city. Through the slates of the wooden walkways, you can make out four archers playing a game of cards, weapons at the ready. A whip cracks loudly as a caravan heads out the gate towards Spur.

Rising up out of the plains, a large walled fort receives the end of the stone road. The river flows from either side, running through the fort from this angle of view. The vegetation surrounding the tradeway at this point has been burned out recently, allowing a clear field of vision from the tops of the walls ahead. The stones show little wear from the heavy traffic of feet and wheels alike; it has certainly been well constructed.

The grass rises taller and taller in every direction further limiting view just off the roadside. A second glance reveals that this is the lowest point in a large, shallow depression. The tradeway sinks a little lower as it gets closer to the river off to the west. A ditch runs alongside the river's side of the road, small puddles of water filling the bottom. Trickles filter into the puddles from the grass beyond as mosquitoes dart across the muddy surfaces.

Only the well-built, stone tradeway gives any hint of civilization ever having had any presence here. The tall grasses limit visibility nearby, hiding any wildlife that may be waiting for prey to stumble too close. A few blades of grass sway slightly in the breeze, some of them broken by the passing of something heavy over them. One of the larger stones in the road, broken loose from its mortar, waits patiently to be repaired.

The stone paved tradeway stretches across the open plains, interrupting nature's task of consuming the land. An endless sea of grass surrounds you, lapping at the road much like the tides against a beach. The faintly damp wind occasionally blowing in from the west smells of earth. Some of the stones in the road interlock together to form the crude image of a lion. There is no discerning if it was done on purpose or sheer accident.

The tradeway runs across the open grasslands northeast towards the Spur, and southwest towards distant lands and eventually, the coast.

In the center of the village a giant fire pit sits where barbarians who wander through the village can sit around to stay warm.  A worn grassy path is here.

The plains stretch as far as the eyes can see, the horizon and the walls of the fort down the road the only blemishes of the grassy landscape in the distance. The stones of the road are smoothly set together, well built to withstand heavy travel.

Short, stout walls and manicured hedges serve to keep out the riffraff and to protect the small, expensive gardens. Every detail has been attended to display the exotic plants, in all their pampered perfection.  A street lantern and a closed rosewood door are here.

This area is illuminated.
You see the 1st battle cat (wearing a small gold collar).

[Noble Way.]

Noble Way continues to wind its way among the rather modestly sized, but elegant, homes of the Spur's successful. Many a peasant farmer may live in homes larger than these, but none can match the quality found here. A peaceful, luxurious feeling pervades this part of town; perhaps it is the drifting floral scents wafting from the well-tended gardens.  A closed elegant black iron gate and a street lantern are here.

[Noble Way.]

Many grand, even ostentatious, homes line this stretch of Noble Way. Most of the residents here were fortunate enough to be born into the right families. Few that live in this area have ever actually had to work for a living. Glancing at the nameplates reveals many of the recognizable names of the Spur. Some of these names could almost be considered famous.  A street lantern is here.

[Noble Way.]

An unusually large home, even for this part of town, lies off to the west. It seems as if one ambitious owner is slowly buying up the lots next to his and adding them to his own. Groundskeepers are at work in the surrounding gardens, trimming and raking, so intent on their work they do not bother to acknowledge the passing traffic on the road.  A street lantern is here.

[Noble Way.]

To the north, you can make out an ornately scrolled gateway set in the base of the imposing city wall. The refined roadway of Noble Way stretches out to the south. The cobblestones of the road are smooth and even. The attention to detail shown here is a dramatic change from some of the other parts of the city.  A street lantern is here.

[Gateway.]

An elegant, carved wooden sign hangs above the ornate gateway set into the massive wall that divides Spurs Noble District from the Town Square. You can make out city guardsmen peering down attentively at all that approach from their posts atop the imposing wall. They seem to take a greater interest in this part of town, though there does not seem to be anything threatening enough here to warrant such attention.  A gilded silver plaque and a street lantern are here.

[Southern Avenue.]

Standing next to the large iron gate that separates the center of town from those of the elite class are several of the Spurian Guard. They are here to assist all who pass with the simple kindness of opening a gate, or the more important task of escorting those in need to the bank or market. A young looking cadet rubs wax into the stones of the city wall, his task is daunting, but one that will teach him discipline.  An open iron gate and a street lantern are here.

[Southern Avenue & Gorey Street.]

The boughs of a large apple tree hang over the well tended avenue. Below the beautiful tree stands a small fountain. Atop the fountain is an intricately carved Secian who appears to be dancing with the water as it splashes around her. Set in the marble base is a small plaque that reads, "For those who have gone before us." Many stand for a moment as they pass this way, giving thanks for the gift of life that is given by both the apple tree and the Secians of long ago. Large piles of dirt and broken stone lay on either side of the street as workmen ready the east and west alleys for expansion.  A street lantern, a Secian etched moonsilver door, a pair of open silver forged swinging doors, and a sign above the doors are here.

[Southern Avenue.]

Vast estates tower over the huge Spurian wall towards the south. The well-to-do who live in these homes idle away their days, enjoying the luxury of time. Standing next to a very empty lantern pole, a small Flerian child insists in a plaintive wail, that he had nothing to do with the missing lantern. The well-dressed guard that interrogates him keeps pointing at a small sack on the ground and its obvious contents.  An open small burlap sack and a street lantern are here.

Southern Avenue leads between the center of Spur and the homes of the prosperous and wealthy. Several of the Ladies of the city stroll along the avenue chatting about the current events and latest gossip of the Spur.

[Town Square South.]

The outward appearance of the people here seems a bit classier. Rich clothing and large coin purses are prevalent amongst the travelers. In fact, many of the folk heading into Town Square from the south are accompanied by large bodyguards to assure their safety. The well maintained road is lined with small brass lanterns, each swinging off an individual pole. No expense has been spared to keep those who travel this road safe from the hoodlums that relish the darkness.  A street lantern and some charred foliage are here.

Neatly trimmed shrubbery line well-maintained cobblestones along Merchant Walk. Apprentices rush by carrying supplies and orders, carrying out their masters' business. Several wooden benches line the walk for those customers who need to rest from the strain of carrying heavy parcels.  A street lantern is here.

A neatly kept park fronts this portion of Merchant Walk. Topiary and low shrubberies partition off small sections of the park. Young lovers sit on benches almost hidden from view, gazing at each other with looks of love, oblivious to the continual bustle of passing customers and merchants on their way to do business.  A street lantern is here.

Merchants, some in frilly finery, others dressed in homespun wools, travel back and forth along this street on their way to and from work. They seem to blend together here, if only briefly. Several of the more haughty looking merchants are trailed by overloaded carts pushed along by haggard young apprentices.   A street lantern is here.

Several city guardsmen have just finished wrestling to the ground some young tough thieves, who thought to rob one of the returning merchants. To one side a relieved-looking Fir Elf gentleman holds on tightly to his gold-tipped walking stick, as the human boy yells his innocence to any who might listen. His pleas fall on deaf ears as the guards drag him away.  A street lantern is here.

Merchant Walk comes to an abrupt end at a massive moonsilver gate. The towering walls of Spur on either side of the gates force all to pass by the guards who are constantly on the watch for thieves and bandits. Just beyond the gates one can glimpse the bustling Merchant District of Spur.  A gilded oak sign and a street lantern are here.

A large gate separates the Merchant District and Town Square-the hub of Spur's activity. The partially opened gate is currently able to accommodate the simultaneous passage of several locals and visitors, but can be expanded to accept carriages, or sealed to ward against invasion.  Guards stand sentry from atop the wall as well as the ground.  A street lantern is here.

Many townsfolk pass along this busy thoroughfare. Rich and poor alike mix freely on this street, much to the dismay of a passing nobleman. A young human struggles with an armful of packages and two young children in tow. Those in need of goods or supplies head west towards the market, those looking for the news of the day head east towards Town Square.  A street lantern is here.

The buildings of Market Circle stand to the south. It becomes obvious that the area through the arch is a much cleaner marketplace than the bazaar. An inviting eatery stands beside the road, its door open to those weary after a long trip to Spur, as well as those preparing to venture to the great expanses beyond the west gate. A human couple exit the building, arm in arm. A small sign stands beside the intersection.  A sign, an open glossy lacquered oak door, and a street lantern are here.

Deep grey mists surround a strange pile of rubble that lies south of the road. Occasionally a priest clad in a simple grey robe will wander past the rubble and whisper a short prayer under his breath. The fence running around the rubble is well kept, but the gate which once allowed entrance to this Temple has been chained closed.  A grey iron chained gate, a pile of rubble, and a street lantern are here.

From the city gate to the west, Trade Way continues eastward towards the busy Merchant district, past Joyeusse's Shop. The air is thick with the scent of fresh flowers.

[Gateway.]

The relative safety inside Spur is a comfort to those returning from the fields and mountains. To those leaving, a massive wall of defense around the city lies ahead. Archer towers beside the gate overlook the wall, offering a painful welcome to would-be invaders. Several guards on foot patrol pass and disappear behind a thick, bluesteel banded steelwood door. Wall road stretches to the south, a wide passage between the city wall and several large buildings.  An open iron gate, an open thick stone door, and a street lantern are here.

[Spur Gateway.]

Travelers from Rathan to the northwest, and the Trade Route to the south, converge at Spur's west gate. Guards posted on the ground give those seeking to enter the city a cursory once-over. Their lack of interest shows that anyone approaching has already been observed from above for some time. A grate in the ground loosens mud from wagon wheels and hooves before they pass through the gate, helping to keep the streets of Spur fairly clean.  An open giant black iron gate, a giant green oak tree, a small blue pool, a thick oak grate over the pool, and a polished stone marker are here.

The path is flanked by countless tall oaks, swaying peacefully in the wind. They do their best to hide the sky from view, making it hard to tell night from day at times.

The remnants of a violent fight lie all around you, whomever used to belong to the wagon is no more than vulture food.  A bloody severed foot is here.

In the dusty distance, Spur's great wall demarks the southern end of this well-traveled merchant's road. Soaring majestically to the north stands the spiky pinnacles and snow topped peaks of an epic mountain range so immense that it separates lands, races, and cultures. Connecting the two is a merchant road built long ago.

The noise and sputum of the big city stains the south eastern horizon through the vague outline of old-growth oaks, maples and cedars.

Lush grass grows up to the borders of a thick, dense forest that cloaks the hills to the west. The grasslands thin near the grove as the huge trees completely shade the ground, and are replaced by taller bushes and juniper trees. The contrast between the waving stalks on the flat vista and the dark leaves of almost vertical trees is striking.

From the west spans a dark green forest of Sycamore and Beech trees that soak in the moister parts of the lower river valley. The tall, shaded forest breaks like a green tinged wave upon the tranquil calm of the grasslands. The huge trees within are ancient, reaching hundreds of feet into the air. As if steaming from a great cauldron, a heavy ground fog seeps from deep within the forest carrying with it the fresh smell of decomposing green matter.

A rickety criss-crossed rough beam fence pens the grazing of black and white cows whose ponderous forms are barely visible through the tall grass on either side of the road. To the north, the soft, undulating grassland floor of the wide valley succumbs to the rolling foothills, which in turn delineates the imposing outline of a vista-spanning mountain range. Many a traveler has witnessed this idyllic vantage point and has been drawn on to follow the road that travels into the heart of the mountains.

The road diverts around a small pool of murky water that lies to the north. A confusion of hoof prints muddies the shoreline where the placid bovines have come to water themselves. The pool is damned by a small hillock which allows no drainage so the pool remains stagnant. The mountains to the north reflect in perfectly upside-down symmetry on the still pond's surface, only wavering slightly in concentric circles to the deft touch of small insects.

The travel-worn road dips and curves around the low lying foothills. Each pass over the top of hillsides presents a new view of the mountain range. Each dip into small valleys reveal minute eco-systems that exist in each wagon wheel rut where water collects. Splayed avion tracks dot the dried mud in random order permanently recording the hunters conquest of lesser things from the mud and moss.

Aged and splintered into the vague circular shape, a decaying wagon wheel is left to rot in the grass by the roadside. Their roots protectively sheltered from the weather, idiosyntric sprouts of taller grasses thrive haphazardly inside the wheel. Several tiny holes top small pyramids of sandy debris, where a few red fire ants scout their wagon-wheel domain for fodder.

As the road bends around a curve, ruts left by merchant's wagons cut so deeply into the mud that all wheeled vehicles are forced to follow the set path. Four loaded wagons of a merchants caravan stand idle as one larger than standard wagon skitters along the path. The buckboard's frame groans and strains to keep it inline while the driver attempts to negotiate the turn. Four dark maned, matched mules balk at the noise behind them, and stomp nervously over the deep ruts. The liveried caravan guards attempt to haul the mules forward, further adding to the mules stubborn refusal to move.

The road charges across a flat valley through waving stalks of grain with coppery tinted seeds. Around the northern edge grows a row of huge cypress trees with trunks that measure eight feet across. Debris from the trees' self-trimming mats the taller grasses into an impenetrable wall. The cypresses produce the necessary windbreak for the field to bear the heavy headed grain.

Broadening to fill the lee of a wide valley, the roadway passes by several temporary campsites where caravans have bolstered the existing comforts for their temporary encampments. Neat stacks of foraged sticks and axe-hewn firewood sit adjacent to the blackened rocks of two impromptu fire rings. Freshly dug midden pits waft clues to the camp's frequent use into the clean mountain air.

Empty wooden crates, broken harnesses, damaged pottery, and the usual byproducts of food preparation fill an impromptu refuse pile adjacent to two campsites.

Just to the north, the roadway curves gently around a bend in a large river that flows towards the southeast. An enormous smooth round rock splits off a small eddy from the main current resulting a deep, clear pool by the eastern side of the road. The cool calm water catches the reflection of the white snowcapped mountain range further up the valley while the river rushes past towards Spur. Five fishermen recline on folding chairs or against rocks, tethered by the silvery lines of their poles to the fishing hole. Each fisherman is spread evenly around the pool as if held apart by some invisible barrier as they eye the large shadowy fish shapes finning effortlessly against the mild current in the eddy.

Standing here, you are easily able to confirm the structure is a bridge. With the breeze swaying it in mid-air, you briefly picture the bridge as a giant brown snake, crawling towards you in the dirt. Even after that image passes, the feeling of dread does not.  A rotting wooden bridge is here.

Flowering vines and bushes crowd onto the trail, threatening to take it over completely.

Inside the open large leather backpack you see a closed iron chest, a closed discolored pouch, a closed weathered spidersilk bag, a closed layered sack, a closed fragile gold chest, a closed antique platinum coffer, a closed delicate iron box, a cup of honor, a cloth lined dinner basket, a Leuian Pride ring, a half-eaten fresh baked apple pie, a simple leather armor, a swirling multicolored globe, a red crystal rune sphere, a white crystal rune sphere, a simple leather armor, a tasty piece of blueberry pie, a white wax candle, some small wooden counting beads, and a spiked iron mace.

This stretch of road is quite unsettling.  You're not sure which bothers you more:  the shadowy presence that you sense to the north, or the eerie force that seems to be calling to the east.  Perhaps these ruins are not so deserted as they once seemed.  A strange glass monocle, a fresh baked apple pie, a glossy finished copper close-faced helm, and a bronze bastard sword are here.

This area is not illuminated.

[Valley of Ruins, Road.]

This stretch of road is quite unsettling.  You're not sure which bothers you more:  the shadowy presence that you sense to the north, or the eerie force that seems to be calling to the east.  Perhaps these ruins are not so deserted as they once seemed.  A strange glass monocle, a fresh baked apple pie, a glossy finished copper close-faced helm, a platinum cutlass, a pearl hilted platinum bastard-sword, a two-handed bronze pike, a platinum cutlass, a platinum cutlass, a hooded grey wool jacket, a platinum cutlass, a bronze bastard sword, and a platinum cutlass are here.

This area is not illuminated.
You see the 1st gargoyle, the 2nd gargoyle corpse, the 1st grizzly beastman corpse, the 3rd gargoyle corpse, the 2nd grizzly beastman, the 3rd grizzly beastman, the 1st skeletal knight, and the 1st celerith swordsman.
In the area are Reyilion the Noble Leuian (lying down), Dogear the Noble Leuian, Lorkhit the Leuian, Audun the Noble Leuian, Kougar the Leuian, Meir the Noble Leuian, and Hott the Noble Leuian.

Flowering vines and bushes crowd onto the trail, threatening to take it over completely.

Old trees lay side by side with the massive boulders of the mountain, intermingling in a terrible landslide.

It would take years for mortal hands to remove the tons of stone from the original roadway to make it passable once again. Thankfully, nature has changed the landscape for the better, and has opened a gap through the mountain to the north.

Just to the north, the roadway curves gently around a bend in a large river that flows towards the southeast. An enormous smooth round rock splits off a small eddy from the main current resulting a deep, clear pool by the eastern side of the road. The cool calm water catches the reflection of the white snowcapped mountain range further up the valley while the river rushes past towards Spur. Five fishermen recline on folding chairs or against rocks, tethered by the silvery lines of their poles to the fishing hole. Each fisherman is spread evenly around the pool as if held apart by some invisible barrier as they eye the large shadowy fish shapes finning effortlessly against the mild current in the eddy.

Empty wooden crates, broken harnesses, damaged pottery, and the usual byproducts of food preparation fill an impromptu refuse pile adjacent to two campsites.

Broadening to fill the lee of a wide valley, the roadway passes by several temporary campsites where caravans have bolstered the existing comforts for their temporary encampments. Neat stacks of foraged sticks and axe-hewn firewood sit adjacent to the blackened rocks of two impromptu fire rings. Freshly dug midden pits waft clues to the camp's frequent use into the clean mountain air.

The road charges across a flat valley through waving stalks of grain with coppery tinted seeds. Around the northern edge grows a row of huge cypress trees with trunks that measure eight feet across. Debris from the trees' self-trimming mats the taller grasses into an impenetrable wall. The cypresses produce the necessary windbreak for the field to bear the heavy headed grain.

As the road bends around a curve, ruts left by merchant's wagons cut so deeply into the mud that all wheeled vehicles are forced to follow the set path. Four loaded wagons of a merchants caravan stand idle as one larger than standard wagon skitters along the path. The buckboard's frame groans and strains to keep it inline while the driver attempts to negotiate the turn. Four dark maned, matched mules balk at the noise behind them, and stomp nervously over the deep ruts. The liveried caravan guards attempt to haul the mules forward, further adding to the mules stubborn refusal to move.

Aged and splintered into the vague circular shape, a decaying wagon wheel is left to rot in the grass by the roadside. Their roots protectively sheltered from the weather, idiosyntric sprouts of taller grasses thrive haphazardly inside the wheel. Several tiny holes top small pyramids of sandy debris, where a few red fire ants scout their wagon-wheel domain for fodder.

The road diverts around a small pool of murky water that lies to the north. A confusion of hoof prints muddies the shoreline where the placid bovines have come to water themselves. The pool is damned by a small hillock which allows no drainage so the pool remains stagnant. The mountains to the north reflect in perfectly upside-down symmetry on the still pond's surface, only wavering slightly in concentric circles to the deft touch of small insects.

A rickety criss-crossed rough beam fence pens the grazing of black and white cows whose ponderous forms are barely visible through the tall grass on either side of the road. To the north, the soft, undulating grassland floor of the wide valley succumbs to the rolling foothills, which in turn delineates the imposing outline of a vista-spanning mountain range. Many a traveler has witnessed this idyllic vantage point and has been drawn on to follow the road that travels into the heart of the mountains.

Travelers from Rathan to the northwest, and the Trade Route to the south, converge at Spur's west gate. Guards posted on the ground give those seeking to enter the city a cursory once-over. Their lack of interest shows that anyone approaching has already been observed from above for some time. A grate in the ground loosens mud from wagon wheels and hooves before they pass through the gate, helping to keep the streets of Spur fairly clean.  An open giant black iron gate, a giant green oak tree, a small blue pool, a thick oak grate over the pool, and a polished stone marker are here.

The city wall stands ominously to the east of the road, an impenetrable mass of stone. Its presence dominates your vision and the road stands in deep, dark shadow until mid-day. Archer towers to the north rise above the top of the wall, indicating the West Gate is near.  A green bush is here.

[Spur Gateway.]

Travelers from Rathan to the northwest, and the Trade Route to the south, converge at Spur's west gate. Guards posted on the ground give those seeking to enter the city a cursory once-over. Their lack of interest shows that anyone approaching has already been observed from above for some time. A grate in the ground loosens mud from wagon wheels and hooves before they pass through the gate, helping to keep the streets of Spur fairly clean.  An open giant black iron gate, a giant green oak tree, a small blue pool, a thick oak grate over the pool, and a polished stone marker are here.

The relative safety inside Spur is a comfort to those returning from the fields and mountains. To those leaving, a massive wall of defense around the city lies ahead. Archer towers beside the gate overlook the wall, offering a painful welcome to would-be invaders. Several guards on foot patrol pass and disappear behind a thick, bluesteel banded steelwood door. Wall road stretches to the south, a wide passage between the city wall and several large buildings.  An open iron gate, an open thick stone door, and a street lantern are here.

A human couple exit the building, arm in arm. A small sign stands beside the intersection.  A sign, an open glossy lacquered oak door, and a street lantern are here.

The traffic on the northern street heading away from town square is an eclectic bunch.  Those who belong to the guilds to the north travel in packs on their way to and from guild events.  It is not unusual to see a group of armored fighters passing a group of robed clerics, each heading in the opposite direction.

It is not unusual to see patrols of this elite group heading down the street towards Town Square. One would hope their presence would allow everyone to live in peace. If only they would stop fingering their swords all the time, you might believe it yourself.  A street lantern is here.

Northern Avenue ends at a gateway set within the massive city walls. On the other side of the gate are the Guild Halls. Those who pass through accept the bond of peace that the Guilds impose on all who desire their services. On either side of the gate guards stand at attention saluting all those who pass by.  An open iron gate, an open thick stone door, and a street lantern are here.

The city walls tower high above you at the entrance to the guild district. On top of the wall, a very bored looking guard with a lazy eye watches those passing through the gate. The large guild buildings spread out around the district, bustling with the day-to-day activity of the city's guild groups.  An open iron gate and a street lantern are here.

The massive building of the Merchant's Guild looms over a vast part of the guild district. The activity at the main door of the guild is mind numbing as hundreds of citizens and merchants alike rush in and out of the guild to handle their business. While the governor has control over the city guard, many claim it is the Merchant's Guild that runs the city of Spur.  An open exquisite polished mahogany door and a street lantern are here.

To the south the road runs back into the center of the city, further to the north the city road continues on toward the other guilds. All the legal city guilds are represented within this city district except for the Forester's Guild. A sign stands beside the road to help direct lost would-be foresters to their guild hall.  A beautiful etched wooden sign and a street lantern are here.

Numerous citizens walk purposefully along the busy street. Fighters and mercenaries make up the majority, but some from almost all walks of life hurry past as well. A dejected street cleaner struggles to keep up with the messes left behind by the pets and other beasts that travel on the roads.  A street lantern is here.

Northern Avenue meets Art Avenue at this intersection. Further to the north, the Mercenary's Guild makes its home, while the Bard's and Sage's Guilds are to the east. The extravagant Merchant's Guild stands to the south. Various sponsors wave pieces of parchment in an attempt to recruit new members.  An open lustrous hammered steel door and a street lantern are here.

The sounds of clashing steel and the calls of battle fill the air near the entrance to the Mercenary's Guild. Numerous hardened warriors lean up against the walls of the building waiting for job offers, while others move in and out of the guild hall going about their daily business. By the looks of it, some of the veterans are giving a barbarian near the front door a hard time.  An open white cedar door and a street lantern are here.

A narrow steel gate leads through a short white stone wall. Beyond the gate lies the practice yard for the Mercenary's Guild. Novice mercenaries sit or stand outside the gate, either resting from their exertions or gathering their courage to enter. Piles of old bandages lie beside the road. Behind the practice yard, the incredible outer wall stands high above the city.  An open polished oak door, a street lantern, and an open narrow grey steel gate are here.

[The Faithful Squire.]

The tangy-sweet smell of metal and leather permeate the air of this shop. A stout Hithual wearing a leather apron barks an order to a young apprentice who lets out a yelp and rushes to the back of the shop to carry out his master's wishes. The shopkeeper mumbles about lazy youngsters and returns to oiling a fine looking leather weapon harness, leaving you to examine his wares on your own.   Some glowing quartz faced copper lanterns and an open polished oak door are here.
