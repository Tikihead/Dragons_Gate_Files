Lined with wooden seats, this slim oak boat looks to be able to carry its passengers relatively quickly to their destination. A sturdy rope is threaded through a steel eyelet that rises about two feet above the bow of the boat. The captain's muscles strain with each heave-ho on the rope, as the boat cleaves through the deep waters of the river.
