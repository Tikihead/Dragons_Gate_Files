>[Elindale's Temple, Altar Room.]

The hum of busy bees and hummingbirds add a tone of unity to the soft chants of the priests and murmurings of those here to offer up the sacrifices and tithes to the great Goddess, Elindale. Several monks wearing floor length robes sit in silence, with the occasional clasped hands rising up in a particularly vibrant part of prayer. The altar itself is composed of growing flowers, the tiny buds enclosing gems and gold alike. Around the base of the altar grows a ring of mushrooms, vibrantly cloaked in red with white spots dotting the umbrellas.  A blooming altar of flowers and a red and white ring of mushrooms are here.

This room is illuminated.
In the room are Dimitrios the Leuian, Chip the Secian, Kithrael the Fir Elf, Lilioth the Secian (holding a glowing tiny crystal sandcastle), and Nominus the Leuian.

Nominus says, "Elindale is the Mother of All, the Eldest, and the Eternal. She is everywhere and all life springs from Her. She is Life and Hope. Without Her, nothing else is possible. The day is Hers and also the night."

Nominus says, "She established the sun and the moon and the stars, made both Summer and Winter and all the seasons. It was She who sets all the boundaries of the earth."

Nominus says, "As clerics of Elindale, we are Her holy emissaries, carrying out Her will throughout the lands and to all people."

Nominus says, "The duty of all of Her children is to promote Her sacred tenets, protecting and preserving the delicate balance of nature."

Nominus says, "And so we begin with this: Respect the Web of Life. Nature is a delicate web. Treat each strand with care, or the whole web may be damaged. We are all interconnected with one another, with the trees, the rivers, the plants, the animals. "

Nominus says, "Every creature, every rock, every drop of water, every leaf is bonded together in an intricate, beautiful web. And every creature, every rock, every drop of water has purpose. "

Nominus says, "To carelessly pluck a strand, be it by burning down a forest, or chopping down a single tree, by polluting a stream or hunting too many of the native fauna in the woods, may have effects that are not be readily evident at first, but which may be dire"

Nominus says, ". Followers of Elindale strive to defend this delicate web against those who might destroy it, knowingly or otherwise."

Nominus says, "We also strive to maintain the balance of Nature."

Nominus says, "Every living creature has purpose and must be treated with respect. But there are times that the life of one creature must be taken to save others. Every creature in nature has purpose, from the industrious ant to the mighty lion, from the proud eagl"

Nominus says, "eagle."

Nominus says, "to the lone wolf."

Nominus says, "Creatures of nature are neither evil nor good. Every creature has both the need and the right to do what it must to survive, so long as doing so does not disrupt nature's balance. "

Nominus says, "Creatures in nature kill not for the sake of killing, but so that they and their kin might live. We do not judge the lion for feeding on the hare. We do not bear grudge against the bear for defending its home or its young. "

Nominus says, "And so the Follower of Elindale does not seek out to kill any innocent creature in its natural habitat for the sheer thrill of the kill, nor solely for the sake of personal gain. But there are times that one creature must die so that others might liv"

Nominus says, "live."

While the tree appears gigantic from the outside, it still is nothing compared to the impression of being on the inside. Hollow branches large enough to pass a drake branch out here, the surfaces smooth, but in a most curious way. It is apparent that no tools were used to create these passageways, yet there is no evidence to give one the impression that the passageways formed over a long period of time. The branches have grown in this manner intentionally, quite unlike any plantlife found anywhere on the land.

A large tapestry lines the outside wall of the passageway, most impressive in that it is not made of fabric, but of vines as tiny as thick hairs, growing in a weave. The delicate shadings of the plants is perfectly natural, and as the eye becomes unfocused, a picture of a diminutive, beautiful maiden sits amongst a foresty background. The wall opposite of this magnificent tapestry is lined with portraits of prominent temple leaders, the colors vibrant, bringing a life-like sense to the frames. The eyes of the maiden in the tapestry seem to follow you, staring directly as you pass, boring into your soul.  A vellum portrait, a canvas portrait, a suede portrait, a wooden framed oil painting, some unfinished portraits, and a carefully painted silk screen are here.

A diminutive niche in the wall provides shelter to a small family of flying squirrels. Just inside sit the young, comfortably settled into the soft bedding the parents have gathered up.

This is the main entrance of a Temple of Elindale, the inside walls perfectly smooth with glowing magickal symbols upon the surfaces. The enormity of this tree becomes apparent as one travels up the stairs to the northwest. The air holds a fresh, new ambiance, pleasantly scented with sweet sap and rich, earthly undertones.  Some glowing magickal symbols and a brown oak staircase are here.

New wooden planks fit side by side creating the walkway that extends proudly upon the reconstructed supports. The view of the forest to the northwest is quite panoramic, despite the burnt spikes of trees in the midst. A staircase here seems to have some enchantment, judging by the strange appearance of unicorns, bears and owls on the lower steps. Strange, due to the fact that they don't appear carved, painted, or put there by any hand-made means. It is as if the glyphs grew into the wood itself. Mysterious symbols are scattered throughout the portraits, which shimmer with a golden whisper as they are approached.

Leaves and small twigs spot the walkway as it hugs against the trunk of the Mother Tree. New sprouts from the branches above hang softly over the wooden planks, shading it slightly. A large building rests gently against the trunk in the limbs above, nestled as though it grew from within the tree itself.  An oak ladder is here.

Intricately crafted stairs lead from the platform to the new building that resides in the upper branches.  An open door and a painted wooden sign are here.

Four sturdy walls and a roof of woven branches enclose this small tavern. From the forest floor, winding their way around the trunk of the Mother Tree, a set of intricately railed steps serve as the entrance and exit of the town of Treehaven. Strangers arriving at the top of the steps find themselves under the watchful eye of patrons seated at tables positioned about the light, airy room. A set of oak steps lead up to the new Council chambers.
