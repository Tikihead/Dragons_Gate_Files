A tall bridge spans the Darkith to the docks on the far side. The docks on this side of the river spread out to the north while the offices of the Seamen's Guild are through a door to the south. A gate also leads to Spur's fairground to the south.  A bridge, an open wooden door, and an open gleaming red and green iron gate are here.

[Gavren Forest, Path]

Large branches hang down from above, casting dark shadows across the forest floor.  With every rustle of the breeze they seem to take on a life of their own, almost to the point of distracting you from the deep ravine that lies ahead, obscured by the gnarly undergrowth.  A mossy rotting log, a crooked crumbling stone bridge, and a dark path are here.

[Dark Forest]

You find yourself at the edge of what appears to be an extremely dense forest.  The trees here have grown so tall that they permit no light to break through their expanse.  No plants can possibly grow on the ground in these inhospitable conditions, and only various fungi and lichen seem to be thriving.  Some giant spotted mushrooms and a crooked crumbling stone bridge are here.

[Dark Forest]

The trees here are quite different from those that are thriving in the rest of the forest.  The long, leafy branches hang so low that they almost form a wall, blocking your view of anything nearby.  Little patches of light must manage to sneak through here and there, since a few weeds seem to be surviving in what otherwise is a dark, dreary place.

[Dark Forest, Mossy Grotto]

The wall of leaves to the southeast seclude this grotto from the rest of the forest, yet they are still the easiest way in and out of here, since a sturdy wall prohibits you from making any further progress to the northwest.  A large stone in one wall appears to have some etchings in it, but is so weathered and so covered in white moss that the markings are now indecipherable.  A mossy stone wall and an opening in the wall are here.

[Forest Glade.]

Columns of crudely built huts stand easily thirty feet tall in the forest glade. Each column is comprised of ten or so homes, stacked on top of each other in a perfectly straight fashion. Windows are little more than openings lined with small twigs and the doorway is an oval entryway covered by a large curtain of pine needles. The individual huts could not be more than three feet in height, with a few even shorter.  A faint magickal path is here.

[Forest Glade.]

A pixie leans her head out the window of the third hut of the column in front of you. Eyes widening in disbelief, she begins to berate you in series of sharp barks, yips, and cries. It sounds more like an animal tongue than any racial tongue you have heard. Her hair is unkempt and wild, tufts of it growing up and out at angles, some dredded, some braided, some just matted. Her eyes seem too close together, and she has no noticeable nose other than two slits where it normally sits. A set of iridescent wings flitter furiously on her back.

A small stream's bank sits at the back of the village. There are strange, perfectly circular tracks leading up and out from a crevice in the muddy ground. A twinkle from within an inky darkness calls your attention to a cave mouth, mostly hidden by the forest greenery. A flash of iridescence and a low humming sound alerts you that there are villagers present, even if not readily apparent by the casual glance.  A dark cavern mouth is here.

The cave's ceiling sparkles in the dim light. Liquids of various colors drip at different rate to the moist floor below. The floor is mostly covered in a thick green moss, providing a natural environment for mushrooms and fungus.

A depression in the far wall of the cavern opens into a larger rivulet that dives deep beneath the wall.

The yellow glow further manifests itself into a golden mist which rolls along the cavern floor.

A particularly viscous amethyst liquid forms a large drop on the cavern ceiling, gaining enough mass to finally plummet to the floor below, where a mushroom awaits. The drop does not splash upon hitting the fungus; instead it clings to it, and slowly forms a coat around its entire body. The mushroom sprouts tubers for legs, and grows in mass and size in front of your eyes. It waddles away while slightly glowing the same amethyst color.

Where the liquids come from before dripping down from the cavern roof is a mystery. Closer inspection reveals a network of small canals and pinholes in the ceiling.

Picking your way across the fungus landscape would be a daunting task, unless you do not mind stepping on more than few of the pale white colored growths. Any movement towards them, however, is met with the fungi retreating or moving around your path.

[Fungus Cavern.]

Where the liquids come from before dripping down from the cavern roof is a mystery. Closer inspection reveals a network of small canals and pinholes in the ceiling. Each contains a sparkling liquid, full of small bubbles and glittering tiny stars, but varying in color. There seems not rhyme or reason to which liquid drips where, only that it replenishes and provides nourishment for the cavern floor.

Light shines down through the cracks of a cave in. The cavern walls are collapsed here, exposing a small path to the surface in the cavern ceiling. A steady progression of the mushrooms and toadstools march up and out this opening, while a pixie frowns down at you from the surface.

A depression in the far wall of the cavern opens into a larger rivulet that dives deep beneath the wall. The liquid magick dripping from the ceiling above pools here and flows to an unknown destination. Large green crystals grow on the walls surrounding the rivulet, radiating power easily felt to even the most uneducated in the ways of magick.

The cave's ceiling sparkles in the dim light. Liquids of various colors drip at different rate to the moist floor below. The floor is mostly covered in a thick green moss, providing a natural environment for mushrooms and fungus. The air is thick with magick, as if you could almost reach out and touch the physical form of magick itself.  A cavern exit and a wooden tree branch are here.

The walls of the cavern are thick with carvings and drawings. Most depict ordinary village life, from the rearing of children and food preparation to the hunting of wild animals and gathering of nuts and berries. One particularly detailed carving depicts the worship of a large alligator. Within the alligator's scales are carved runes that glow with an eerie yellow color. The yellow glow further manifests itself into a golden mist which rolls along the cavern floor.

A particularly viscous amethyst liquid forms a large drop on the cavern ceiling, gaining enough mass to finally plummet to the floor below, where a mushroom awaits. The drop does not splash upon hitting the fungus; instead it clings to it, and slowly forms a coat around its entire body. The mushroom sprouts tubers for legs, and grows in mass and size in front of your eyes. It waddles away while slightly glowing the same amethyst color.

A small stream's bank sits at the back of the village. There are strange, perfectly circular tracks leading up and out from a crevice in the muddy ground. A twinkle from within an inky darkness calls your attention to a cave mouth, mostly hidden by the forest greenery. A flash of iridescence and a low humming sound alerts you that there are villagers present, even if not readily apparent by the casual glance.  A dark cavern mouth is here.

A pixie leans her head out the window of the third hut of the column in front of you. Eyes widening in disbelief, she begins to berate you in series of sharp barks, yips, and cries. It sounds more like an animal tongue than any racial tongue you have heard. Her hair is unkempt and wild, tufts of it growing up and out at angles, some dredded, some braided, some just matted. Her eyes seem too close together, and she has no noticeable nose other than two slits where it normally sits. A set of iridescent wings flitter furiously on her back.  A small iron cooking pot is here.

Windows are little more than openings lined with small twigs and the doorway is an oval entryway covered by a large curtain of pine needles. The individual huts could not be more than three feet in height, with a few even shorter.  A faint magickal path is here.

The building ahead is unlike any others in the village. The construction is not of packed mud, rather it is bark-stripped long timbers crossed and piled on top of each other. Every inch of the pale wood is carved or marked with arcane and mysterious shapes. Triangles within circles, elongated animal shapes, stick figures, concentric circles, and moon shapes are but of a few of the shapes that mark the wood. The entryway has no door, which allows a view into the interior chamber. It is barren save for an altar decorated by bowls of meat and fruits, coins and bones.

The remains of several giant horned beetles are scattered on the ground. The shiny black carapaces are being cleaned of their inner organs and fluids by three male pixies. One male makes long scrapes with a bladed handle up and down the dull side of the carapaces, while another male fits them with thin leather ties through freshly made holes. The third male ties the improvised breastplates on, and nods in apparent satisfaction. As focused on their work as the winged beings are, they do not notice your approach. Multi-colored paints are worn on their faces, stripes and circles arranged on their foreheads and cheeks.  A tiny black waitress dress, a dead grey mouse, and a fresh baked apple pie are here.

The building ahead is unlike any others in the village. The construction is not of packed mud, rather it is bark-stripped long timbers crossed and piled on top of each other. Every inch of the pale wood is carved or marked with arcane and mysterious shapes. Triangles within circles, elongated animal shapes, stick figures, concentric circles, and moon shapes are but of a few of the shapes that mark the wood. The entryway has no door, which allows a view into the interior chamber. It is barren save for an altar decorated by bowls of meat and fruits, coins and bones. The enormous skull of what could only be an alligator tops the altar.  A tiny singing ivory bluebird statue is here.

[Forest Glade.]

The building ahead is unlike any others in the village. The construction is not of packed mud, rather it is bark-stripped long timbers crossed and piled on top of each other. Every inch of the pale wood is carved or marked with arcane and mysterious shapes. Triangles within circles, elongated animal shapes, stick figures, concentric circles, and moon shapes are but of a few of the shapes that mark the wood. The entryway has no door, which allows a view into the interior chamber. It is barren save for an altar decorated by bowls of meat and fruits, coins and bones. The enormous skull of what could only be an alligator tops the altar.  A tiny singing ivory bluebird statue, a dead grey mouse, and a fresh baked apple pie are here.

 ** You are fully rested.

You follow Klug southwest...


The area brightens.
[Forest Glade.]

The column in front of you is both a natural wonder and a disorganized collection of twigs, leaves, mud, and stones. It appears the huts that make up the column were made of mostly packed and dried mud, with an outer protective layer of small pebbles placed in the mud while it was drying. Each home has a semblance of a roof, made of evergreen needles, small twigs, and branches for support.

The area brightens.
[Forest Glade.]

Columns of crudely built huts stand easily thirty feet tall in the forest glade. Each column is comprised of ten or so homes, stacked on top of each other in a perfectly straight fashion. Windows are little more than openings lined with small twigs and the doorway is an oval entryway covered by a large curtain of pine needles. The individual huts could not be more than three feet in height, with a few even shorter.  A faint magickal path is here.

[Dark Forest, Mossy Grotto]

The wall of leaves to the southeast seclude this grotto from the rest of the forest, yet they are still the easiest way in and out of here, since a sturdy wall prohibits you from making any further progress to the northwest.  A large stone in one wall appears to have some etchings in it, but is so weathered and so covered in white moss that the markings are now indecipherable.  A mossy stone wall and an opening in the wall are here.

You follow Klug southeast...


The area brightens.
[Dark Forest]

The trees here are quite different from those that are thriving in the rest of the forest.  The long, leafy branches hang so low that they almost form a wall, blocking your view of anything nearby.  Little patches of light must manage to sneak through here and there, since a few weeds seem to be surviving in what otherwise is a dark, dreary place.

The forest floor mixes with murky water to form a mushy quagmire. Any step taken through the morass is partnered with a sucking sound caused by pulling your foot from the swampy mess.  A slippery path is here.

Clouds of gnats swarm all about the swamp. Barely perceivable by ear or eye, a single gnat would be easily ignored. The hundreds of thousands that comprise a single cloud emit a soft humming noise, the culmination of each individual wing beat. Small, green frogs with impossibly long tongues enjoy the plentiful food source.

Enormous cyprus trees call the swamp home. Each of these ancient trees send out a vast network of roots. Closer to the water line where the roots enter the ground, each large root divides several times. The resemblence to legs ending in feet ending in toes is uncanny.

The wall of leaves to the southeast seclude this grotto from the rest of the forest, yet they are still the easiest way in and out of here, since a sturdy wall prohibits you from making any further progress to the northwest.

[Forest Glade.]

Columns of crudely built huts stand easily thirty feet tall in the forest glade. Each column is comprised of ten or so homes, stacked on top of each other in a perfectly straight fashion. Windows are little more than openings lined with small twigs and the doorway is an oval entryway covered by a large curtain of pine needles. The individual huts could not be more than three feet in height, with a few even shorter.  A faint magickal path is here.

A pixie leans her head out the window of the third hut of the column in front of you. Eyes widening in disbelief, she begins to berate you in series of sharp barks, yips, and cries. It sounds more like an animal tongue than any racial tongue you have heard. Her hair is unkempt and wild, tufts of it growing up and out at angles, some dredded, some braided, some just matted. Her eyes seem too close together, and she has no noticeable nose other than two slits where it normally sits. A set of iridescent wings flitter furiously on her back.

A small stream's bank sits at the back of the village. There are strange, perfectly circular tracks leading up and out from a crevice in the muddy ground. A twinkle from within an inky darkness calls your attention to a cave mouth, mostly hidden by the forest greenery. A flash of iridescence and a low humming sound alerts you that there are villagers present, even if not readily apparent by the casual glance.  A dark cavern mouth is here.

[Fungus Cavern.]

The cave's ceiling sparkles in the dim light. Liquids of various colors drip at different rate to the moist floor below. The floor is mostly covered in a thick green moss, providing a natural environment for mushrooms and fungus. The air is thick with magick, as if you could almost reach out and touch the physical form of magick itself.  A cavern exit is here.

A depression in the far wall of the cavern opens into a larger rivulet that dives deep beneath the wall. The liquid magick dripping from the ceiling above pools here and flows to an unknown destination. Large green crystals grow on the walls surrounding the rivulet, radiating power easily felt to even the most uneducated in the ways of magick.

The walls of the cavern are thick with carvings and drawings. Most depict ordinary village life, from the rearing of children and food preparation to the hunting of wild animals and gathering of nuts and berries. One particularly detailed carving depicts the worship of a large alligator. Within the alligator's scales are carved runes that glow with an eerie yellow color. The yellow glow further manifests itself into a golden mist which rolls along the cavern floor.

A particularly viscous amethyst liquid forms a large drop on the cavern ceiling, gaining enough mass to finally plummet to the floor below, where a mushroom awaits. The drop does not splash upon hitting the fungus; instead it clings to it, and slowly forms a coat around its entire body. The mushroom sprouts tubers for legs, and grows in mass and size in front of your eyes. It waddles away while slightly glowing the same amethyst color.

Where the liquids come from before dripping down from the cavern roof is a mystery. Closer inspection reveals a network of small canals and pinholes in the ceiling. Each contains a sparkling liquid, full of small bubbles and glittering tiny stars, but varying in color. There seems not rhyme or reason to which liquid drips where, only that it replenishes and provides nourishment for the cavern floor.

Where the liquids come from before dripping down from the cavern roof is a mystery. Closer inspection reveals a network of small canals and pinholes in the ceiling. Each contains a sparkling liquid, full of small bubbles and glittering tiny stars, but varying in color. There seems not rhyme or reason to which liquid drips where, only that it replenishes and provides nourishment for the cavern floor.

A particularly viscous amethyst liquid forms a large drop on the cavern ceiling, gaining enough mass to finally plummet to the floor below, where a mushroom awaits. The drop does not splash upon hitting the fungus; instead it clings to it, and slowly forms a coat around its entire body. The mushroom sprouts tubers for legs, and grows in mass and size in front of your eyes. It waddles away while slightly glowing the same amethyst color.

A depression in the far wall of the cavern opens into a larger rivulet that dives deep beneath the wall. The liquid magick dripping from the ceiling above pools here and flows to an unknown destination. Large green crystals grow on the walls surrounding the rivulet, radiating power easily felt to even the most uneducated in the ways of magick.

[Fungus Cavern.]

The cave's ceiling sparkles in the dim light. Liquids of various colors drip at different rate to the moist floor below. The floor is mostly covered in a thick green moss, providing a natural environment for mushrooms and fungus. The air is thick with magick, as if you could almost reach out and touch the physical form of magick itself.  A cavern exit is here.

[Forest Glade.]

A small stream's bank sits at the back of the village. There are strange, perfectly circular tracks leading up and out from a crevice in the muddy ground. A twinkle from within an inky darkness calls your attention to a cave mouth, mostly hidden by the forest greenery. A flash of iridescence and a low humming sound alerts you that there are villagers present, even if not readily apparent by the casual glance.  A dark cavern mouth is here.

[Forest Glade.]

A pixie leans her head out the window of the third hut of the column in front of you. Eyes widening in disbelief, she begins to berate you in series of sharp barks, yips, and cries. It sounds more like an animal tongue than any racial tongue you have heard. Her hair is unkempt and wild, tufts of it growing up and out at angles, some dredded, some braided, some just matted. Her eyes seem too close together, and she has no noticeable nose other than two slits where it normally sits. A set of iridescent wings flitter furiously on her back.

[Forest Glade.]

Columns of crudely built huts stand easily thirty feet tall in the forest glade. Each column is comprised of ten or so homes, stacked on top of each other in a perfectly straight fashion. Windows are little more than openings lined with small twigs and the doorway is an oval entryway covered by a large curtain of pine needles. The individual huts could not be more than three feet in height, with a few even shorter.  A faint magickal path is here.

[Dark Forest, Mossy Grotto]

The wall of leaves to the southeast seclude this grotto from the rest of the forest, yet they are still the easiest way in and out of here, since a sturdy wall prohibits you from making any further progress to the northwest.  A large stone in one wall appears to have some etchings in it, but is so weathered and so covered in white moss that the markings are now indecipherable.  A mossy stone wall and an opening in the wall are here.

The trees here are quite different from those that are thriving in the rest of the forest.  The long, leafy branches hang so low that they almost form a wall, blocking your view of anything nearby.  Little patches of light must manage to sneak through here and there, since a few weeds seem to be surviving in what otherwise is a dark, dreary place.

[Road.]

Even though it shows heavy wear, the road is in remarkably good repair. It was built by expert craftsmen to withstand the rigors of time and use. Evidence of recent repairs indicate that any problems are dealt with quickly and competently.  Some dried crimson streaks of blood and a closed old wooden trash wagon are here.

[South gate.]

Through the gate lies the city of Spur, the major center of trade and civilization on the plains. The dusty road leading through the gates is well traveled, and walls of the city are in good repair. A small shack sits to the west of the road, during most times of the day a dusty coach can be seen waiting in front, its horses stomping with impatience to be gone. To the right of the door is a small window, its opening covered with metal bars. An old man, missing most of his teeth, waits patiently for the travelers to pay their fare, and then directs them into the waiting area. On the east side of the road a billowing multicolored tent has been erected, the hustle and bustle of merchants and customers can be seen coming and going at all times of the day.  An open iron gate and a rainbow silk tent are here.

A well-guarded gateway separates the city's residential district from the farmlands just beyond. Guards carefully eye all that enter or exit the city, beckoning gruffly to random travelers for a closer inspection. The structure of the guards' barracks is visible above the road to the west. A weathered wooden sign is posted by the gate.  An open stone gate, a wooden sign, an open thick stone door, and a street lantern are here.

[Noble Way.]

The occasional locked gate marks the entrance to some of the more hidden estates of Spurs nobility. From this broad avenue, little can be seen of their splendor. Behind the imposing gate recedes a proud drive, disappearing mysteriously into the trees. If not for the large imposing tower rising above the hedges it would be hard to discern anything was beyond the gate. It is apparent the residents do not wish to be disturbed.  A street lantern, a closed morbius door, and an open black iron gate are here.

Majestic elms continue to line this broad roadway, sheltering the avenue on both sides and further enhancing the grandiose atmosphere. Fronting the beautiful homes, cobbled paths edged with narrow flower beds meander through nearby private gardens. Though they appear wonderful places to spend an afternoon or take a picnic, the glances from those tending the estates makes it clear they are only for the invited.  A street lantern is here.

[Noble Crossroads.]

A small roadway bordered by flowering hedges bisects the wide avenue of Noble Way at a right angle, heading east to west.  A thick, sturdy sign stands just off to the side of a charming path, its large friendly letters intent on luring travelers into the city's premiere roadstay, the Gilded Lion Inn. The entrance is clearly marked and welcoming, extending off to the southeast.  A wooden sign and a street lantern are here.

Occasional gates and driveways lead back into the well-kept estates of the city's nobility, breaking and adding interest to the defining plane of the walls lining Noble Way. The rest of the street seems to mimic the splendor of the estates beyond the wall. Swept and trimmed, the roadway exudes a simple, yet beautiful elegance.  A street lantern is here.

Numerous trees lining the avenue serve as the dividing border between the majestic estates of the nobility and the lightly traveled roadway. The estates themselves are noticeably closer to the avenue than those to the south. However, they are no easier to access, still protected by their own guarding walls, some covered with ivy or colorful blooming vines.  A street lantern is here.

The entire avenue is composed of fine cobblestone, each level with its neighbor, providing a smooth ride for passing carriages and horses. The stones were customized by craftsmen, cut to order, rather than simply placed wherever they might fit. A few stately oaks and elms line the sides of the road, shading travelers during the daylight hours.  A street lantern is here.

[Intersection.]

The avenue comes to a fork, with Noble Way curving from south to the northwest. A side-street heading off to the east leads to an extremely well kept neighborhood that easily surpasses everything around it in splendor and magnificence. Everything, even the carefully pruned trees and the manicured shrubbery displays a desire for elegant perfection.  A street lantern is here.

Leaving the exceptionally wealthy estates of the Spurian nobility, Noble Way heads toward the Town Square to the northwest. Along the roadside can be seen the in-city homes of successful merchants and other wealthy citizens of the Spur. The homes display a slightly different style, perhaps they are not quite so restrained; a touch more exuberance and freedom with materials is displayed.  A street lantern is here.

Gazing down each of the nearby private drives reveals a glimpse of a luxurious home, each a miniature estate in its own right. Short, stout walls and manicured hedges serve to keep out the riffraff and to protect the small, expensive gardens. Every detail has been attended to display the exotic plants, in all their pampered perfection.  A street lantern and a closed rosewood door are here.

Noble Way continues to wind its way among the rather modestly sized, but elegant, homes of the Spur's successful. Many a peasant farmer may live in homes larger than these, but none can match the quality found here. A peaceful, luxurious feeling pervades this part of town; perhaps it is the drifting floral scents wafting from the well-tended gardens.  A closed elegant black iron gate and a street lantern are here.

Many grand, even ostentatious, homes line this stretch of Noble Way. Most of the residents here were fortunate enough to be born into the right families. Few that live in this area have ever actually had to work for a living. Glancing at the nameplates reveals many of the recognizable names of the Spur. Some of these names could almost be considered famous.  A street lantern is here.

An unusually large home, even for this part of town, lies off to the west. It seems as if one ambitious owner is slowly buying up the lots next to his and adding them to his own. Groundskeepers are at work in the surrounding gardens, trimming and raking, so intent on their work they do not bother to acknowledge the passing traffic on the road.  A street lantern is here.

An elegant, carved wooden sign hangs above the ornate gateway set into the massive wall that divides Spurs Noble District from the Town Square. You can make out city guardsmen peering down attentively at all that approach from their posts atop the imposing wall. They seem to take a greater interest in this part of town, though there does not seem to be anything threatening enough here to warrant such attention.

Standing next to the large iron gate that separates the center of town from those of the elite class are several of the Spurian Guard. They are here to assist all who pass with the simple kindness of opening a gate, or the more important task of escorting those in need to the bank or market. A young looking cadet rubs wax into the stones of the city wall, his task is daunting, but one that will teach him discipline.  An open iron gate, a street lantern, a slate grey misty fog, and a slate grey misty fog are here.

The boughs of a large apple tree hang over the well tended avenue. Below the beautiful tree stands a small fountain. Atop the fountain is an intricately carved Secian who appears to be dancing with the water as it splashes around her. Set in the marble base is a small plaque that reads, "For those who have gone before us." Many stand for a moment as they pass this way, giving thanks for the gift of life that is given by both the apple tree and the Secians of long ago. Large piles of dirt and broken stone lay on either side of the street as workmen ready the east and west alleys for expansion.  A street lantern, a Secian etched moonsilver door, a pair of open silver forged swinging doors, a sign above the doors, and a slate grey misty fog are here.

Vast estates tower over the huge Spurian wall towards the south. The well-to-do who live in these homes idle away their days, enjoying the luxury of time. Standing next to a very empty lantern pole, a small Flerian child insists in a plaintive wail, that he had nothing to do with the missing lantern. The well-dressed guard that interrogates him keeps pointing at a small sack on the ground and its obvious contents.  An open small burlap sack, a street lantern, and a slate grey misty fog are here.

The outward appearance of the people here seems a bit classier. Rich clothing and large coin purses are prevalent amongst the travelers. In fact, many of the folk heading into Town Square from the south are accompanied by large bodyguards to assure their safety. The well maintained road is lined with small brass lanterns, each swinging off an individual pole. No expense has been spared to keep those who travel this road safe from the hoodlums that relish the darkness.  A street lantern and some charred foliage are here.

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.   A flowing white marble fountain, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a marble statue of a Human, a rosewood sign, a short bronze dagger, an open crude bag, and a broken heavy thick banded bamboo armor are here.

A dark pallor of smoky air hangs heavily over the area.  A street lantern and a heavy mahogany door are here.

Many people crowd the narrow Bazaar Path, either heading towards the infamous Bazaar, or forcing their way back towards Trade Way. For a small price, a farmer can rent a booth and directly market his goods. Both some of the best and some of the worst deals can be made within this collection of stalls. The tall wall of Spur looms high to the east, and many of the guards take an early peek into the carts and the goods coming to market.  A street lantern is here.

Further passage along Bazaar Path is blocked occasionally by brawling peasants.

To the northeast a small tent can barely be seen hiding behind the stalls.  A white silk tent and a street lantern are here.

The well-defined Bazaar path heads off to the west. This corner is a mix of the old and the new. On one corner an old stall is barely standing. The roof has caved in, and it quickly becomes apparent that this location has become a local dump. Pieces of wood that look suspiciously like some of the leftovers from other construction sites are piled on top of rotting offal. On the opposite corner a new tent is being erected, its high roof and vivid coloring pleasing to the eye.  An open stall and a street lantern are here.

Low-grade wood and bent nails make up this sorry excuse for a business establishment. A small sign on the front has a crude picture of a key on it, and the name, "Skugz."

[The Bazaar.]

A new stall has been hastily constructed on this site, in the shadow of the large Spurian Wall. Most chose to build well within the Bazaar as opposed to this outer path. Low-grade wood and bent nails make up this sorry excuse for a business establishment. A small sign on the front has a crude picture of a key on it, and the name, "Skugz."  A crooked wooden sign, a weathered dark wooden stall, and a broken street lantern are here.

In the area are Davide the Usil Elf (holding a glowing diamond tipped ivory staff of mages), Dezzaray the Leuian, and Klug the Oog-ra.

Two large Oog-ra guards refuse to allow anyone to continue south. With loud gestures and over exaggerated pointing, they send wagons to the east or back north. With some slapping of backs, and happy grins, they congratulate themselves on following directions. A yell is heard from the south as Skugz screams, "Keep meee dooor clear...yes yeees...keep it clear." It is a wonder that he hasn't figured out they are turning away his customers.  A street lantern is here.

A slinky dressed female San Elf preens and giggles garnering the attention of several humans leaning out the window of the guards' quarters. Catcalls and whistles abound as she shows more thigh then is warranted. A wagon driver, distracted by the view, almost drives into a cart coming the opposite direction. Shouts are exchanged and fists shaken, as the San female snickers at all those involved.  A street lantern is here.

The foul odor of something that can be almost described as rotted corpses floats in from the east.

Bazaar Path follows the line of the Spurian Wall. High above you can hear orders being barked and guards marching in rhythm. The closeness of the wall to the path has essentially blocked any breeze that might waft through the area. The stagnant air holds in the smells of food, incense and lots of bodies. It is not unusual to see the cart drivers with triangles of cloth pulled up over their nose and mouths.  A street lantern is here.

Several large carts head west, full of various items the owners are sure will sell for a decent profit. Empty carts, the sign of a prosperous day, head east. An old Thugian pulls and pushes a very stubborn donkey. Neither end seems to be cooperating with his demands. Two small children dance around the Thugian and the donkey, chanting and singing a nasty song. Quickly, he takes out a switch, which is enough encouragement for both the donkey to move and the children to run.  A street lantern is here.

The foot traffic on Bazaar Path turns south down a small trail into the heart of the Bazaar. Many of the smaller carts follow the buyers and merchants to avoid the conflicts with the larger wagons that continue west.

Bazaar Path makes a sudden left hand turn, following the direction of the large Spurian Wall. Carts and wagons creak in protest as their heavy loads shift precariously.

The going slows down briefly as someone stops dead in their tracks. Every so often one feels the need to take in the sounds and smells that are uniquely the Bazaar. Any slow down in the movement of the crowd creates a loud string of curses. The sellers are eager to get to market to get rid of their goods, and the buyers anticipate their purchases.

Further passage along Bazaar Path is blocked occasionally by brawling peasants.

Many people crowd the narrow Bazaar Path, either heading towards the infamous Bazaar, or forcing their way back towards Trade Way. For a small price, a farmer can rent a booth and directly market his goods. Both some of the best and some of the worst deals can be made within this collection of stalls. The tall wall of Spur looms high to the east, and many of the guards take an early peek into the carts and the goods coming to market.  A street lantern is here.

The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.

[Town Square Center.]

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.   A flowing white marble fountain, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a marble statue of a Human, a rosewood sign, an open crude bag, and a broken heavy thick banded bamboo armor are here.

The buildings of Market Circle stand to the south. It becomes obvious that the area through the arch is a much cleaner marketplace than the bazaar. An inviting eatery stands beside the road, its door open to those weary after a long trip to Spur, as well as those preparing to venture to the great expanses beyond the west gate. A human couple exit the building, arm in arm. A small sign stands beside the intersection.  A sign, an open glossy lacquered oak door, and a street lantern are here.

Deep grey mists surround a strange pile of rubble that lies south of the road. Occasionally a priest clad in a simple grey robe will wander past the rubble and whisper a short prayer under his breath. The fence running around the rubble is well kept, but the gate which once allowed entrance to this Temple has been chained closed.  A grey iron chained gate, a pile of rubble, and a street lantern are here.

[Gateway.]

The relative safety inside Spur is a comfort to those returning from the fields and mountains. To those leaving, a massive wall of defense around the city lies ahead. Archer towers beside the gate overlook the wall, offering a painful welcome to would-be invaders. Several guards on foot patrol pass and disappear behind a thick, bluesteel banded steelwood door. Wall road stretches to the south, a wide passage between the city wall and several large buildings.  An open iron gate, an open thick stone door, and a street lantern are here.

Connecting the two is a merchant road built long ago.

Lush grass grows up to the borders of a thick, dense forest that cloaks the hills to the west. The grasslands thin near the grove as the huge trees completely shade the ground, and are replaced by taller bushes and juniper trees. The contrast between the waving stalks on the flat vista and the dark leaves of almost vertical trees is striking.

From the west spans a dark green forest of Sycamore and Beech trees that soak in the moister parts of the lower river valley. The tall, shaded forest breaks like a green tinged wave upon the tranquil calm of the grasslands. The huge trees within are ancient, reaching hundreds of feet into the air. As if steaming from a great cauldron, a heavy ground fog seeps from deep within the forest carrying with it the fresh smell of decomposing green matter.

A rickety criss-crossed rough beam fence pens the grazing of black and white cows whose ponderous forms are barely visible through the tall grass on either side of the road. To the north, the soft, undulating grassland floor of the wide valley succumbs to the rolling foothills, which in turn delineates the imposing outline of a vista-spanning mountain range. Many a traveler has witnessed this idyllic vantage point and has been drawn on to follow the road that travels into the heart of the mountains.

The road diverts around a small pool of murky water that lies to the north. A confusion of hoof prints muddies the shoreline where the placid bovines have come to water themselves. The pool is damned by a small hillock which allows no drainage so the pool remains stagnant. The mountains to the north reflect in perfectly upside-down symmetry on the still pond's surface, only wavering slightly in concentric circles to the deft touch of small insects.

Splayed avion tracks dot the dried mud in random order permanently recording the hunters conquest of lesser things from the mud and moss.

Aged and splintered into the vague circular shape, a decaying wagon wheel is left to rot in the grass by the roadside. Their roots protectively sheltered from the weather, idiosyntric sprouts of taller grasses thrive haphazardly inside the wheel. Several tiny holes top small pyramids of sandy debris, where a few red fire ants scout their wagon-wheel domain for fodder.

As the road bends around a curve, ruts left by merchant's wagons cut so deeply into the mud that all wheeled vehicles are forced to follow the set path. Four loaded wagons of a merchants caravan stand idle as one larger than standard wagon skitters along the path. The buckboard's frame groans and strains to keep it inline while the driver attempts to negotiate the turn. Four dark maned, matched mules balk at the noise behind them, and stomp nervously over the deep ruts. The liveried caravan guards attempt to haul the mules forward, further adding to the mules stubborn refusal to move.

The road charges across a flat valley through waving stalks of grain with coppery tinted seeds. Around the northern edge grows a row of huge cypress trees with trunks that measure eight feet across. Debris from the trees' self-trimming mats the taller grasses into an impenetrable wall. The cypresses produce the necessary windbreak for the field to bear the heavy headed grain.

Broadening to fill the lee of a wide valley, the roadway passes by several temporary campsites where caravans have bolstered the existing comforts for their temporary encampments. Neat stacks of foraged sticks and axe-hewn firewood sit adjacent to the blackened rocks of two impromptu fire rings. Freshly dug midden pits waft clues to the camp's frequent use into the clean mountain air.

Just to the north, the roadway curves gently around a bend in a large river that flows towards the southeast. An enormous smooth round rock splits off a small eddy from the main current resulting a deep, clear pool by the eastern side of the road. The cool calm water catches the reflection of the white snowcapped mountain range further up the valley while the river rushes past towards Spur. Five fishermen recline on folding chairs or against rocks, tethered by the silvery lines of their poles to the fishing hole. Each fisherman is spread evenly around the pool as if held apart by some invisible barrier as they eye the large shadowy fish shapes finning effortlessly against the mild current in the eddy.

A few proud workers chiseled their initials and the date into their handiwork, most reading the date of Rinannimas, 6th month, 61st day, year 313.

A brown and white osprey soars above the raging river, scanning the water for a meal. Suddenly, it dives down to the surface and snatches a rather large trout from the water.

Boulders stacked in pyramids contained by large timbers stand mutely to the side of the roadway next to an impromptu dump of broken tools, wooden stakes and empty buckets lined with mortar. Deeply grooved sled tracks lead to the east towards the bridge from this part of the road where the flatness of the valley was best suited for the staging area during the bridge's reconstruction. Smooth rectangles of tent foundations still mark their location in a semi circle around a blackened fire ring where the workers and their supervisors lived during it's rebuilding.

The decaying remains of the bridge workers camp sprawls across this flat valley. To house their draft beasts, the workers constructed small stalls and shelters from rickety boards nailed quixotically to the standing trees. Three brass ring topped posts lie sunk into the grasslands turf, to the south, which was most likely used for tethering grazing animals. Between the posts is a rough stone trough that is filled automatically with water by a rickety mechanical wind mill, whirling lazily in the breeze.

Water loving trees hug the river's course through the low lying valley. Giant beech and huge alders vie for the valuable sodden shoreline and shade the understory bushes and ferns from direct sunlight. The result is a lushly green, verdant forest that obscures the river from the view on the road, though the hiss of rushing water reveals it's course.

Running parallel to the road is a smooth rock lined trench that channels the road's run-off during rainstorms. This flat part of the road that follows the valley floor would be prone to turn into a muddy bog and therefore a hazard to most caravans and their pack animals. Anticipating this event, the road's engineers built drains into the lower side of the road that carry the runoff into the culvert, which carries it harmlessly down to the low end of the valley.

White barked birch trees populate the moist valleys that drain into the river to the southeast as the merchant road passes nearby. The tall vertical trees reach to the sky in a beautiful dance reminiscent of dancers waving their arms gracefully to some unheard rhythm. The grain-laden grasses sway in accompaniment, and the tinkling waterfalls and babbling creeks beat like odd syncopated patterns onto the rocks.

The roadway takes advantage of a cut in the hill to negotiate a tumbled cliff face. At the top of the hill is a high, flat, steppe grassland, and at the bottom is the edge of the open range. At one point, the road narrows to cross a small stream. Very little mud gathers in the shallows of the stream and the pebbles and rocks glitter like gold as the wagon wheels churn the gravel.

The merchant roads widens as it travels another grass swept plateau. The mountain range fills the northern skyline in stark detail. Huge snow capped peaks and rough faced cliffs are close enough to see the individual boulders, waterfalls, and haphazard game trails. Much higher up the great mountainsides a line where trees stop growing gives testament to the altitude. The air is cool.

The grassland plateau is embraced by a stand of dark green oak trees so thick that little light passes through the profusion of their many lobed leaves. The forest is ancient and the trunks of the trees bare witness to fires, lightning strikes and the attacks of insects. Large gout-like burls disfigure some of the wide, grey trunks which have grown quietly next to the road for hundreds of years.

Crunching loudly on the road is a ankle high deposit of acorn hulls and their discarded caps. Quick footed grey squirrels dash across the road, or above on the high intertwined branches of the stately oaks, with the highly coveted acorns grasped firmly in their teeth. The squirrels flash their tails at each other in some unknown signal as traffic passes on the road.  A pile of empty acorn caps is here.

The merchant road makes a wide turn as it passes through the thick oak forest. A tiny meadow with a murmuring creek is the only open spot in sight. Bright wildflowers and fragrant mosses crowd around a sparkling jewel of a pond while the huge oaks stand like sentinels around the edges. A spotted fawn and its doe-eyed mother drink cautiously, swishing their white edged tails quickly.

The merchant road follows a bumpy path through the oak forest. Each stately old tree has added a few feet to it's girth since the road was first surveyed and constructed hundreds of years ago. Their roots have plied across the road, upending it's hand laid foundation and hand pounded bed. Several large knees of the oak's roots have leveraged up the edges of the road, hindering all wagons' passage and threatening to break spokes and axles.

Off to the side of the road, perhaps a hundred feet away, stands an enormous tree that commands the attention of all who pass this direction. It's offspring populate the plateau for miles in both directions. At one time, the tree must have stood alone on the prairie soil and dropped acorns year after year until one tree became a huge forest of oaks.

The merchant road takes a large bend as it travels through the dark woodland. Venerable, wide-trunked oaks line the merchant road and the trunks of the closest ones have been marked by the passage of thousands of travelers and adventurers. Some have carved their initials, some, a picture of loved ones or body parts of odd proportions, and some, the date they passed by.

The high steppe grasslands yields to a green wall of oak trees to the southeast. The oak forest is very old, the greying trunks of the behemoths are cracked and split. The road immediately darkens under the canopy of the green leaves. Pale green bracken ferns grow tall in the eternal twilight shade. Flat, yellow capped mushrooms and rippled shelf fungi sprout from the fallen trees. The pleasant aroma of healthy decomposing leaves fills the air.

Hand pounded concrete pipes, half circle in shape, channel two small streams under the chinked rock and gravel road-bed. The icy spring water bubbles down the hill and glides over a sheet of shorn granite until it fills a crystal clear pool at the bottom, far below the road. The pool's overflow creates a single clear stream that meanders towards the ancient oak forest.

To the southeast, two streams trickle from the north and pass directly under the roadbed. The twin streams combine as they travel down the hill to make a picture-perfect waterfall rimmed by delicate maidenhair ferns and bright green moss. The little riverlet from the pool then flows into an ancient oak forest further southeast.

The merchant road swerves around a rock strewn hill. Several ancient oak trees grow in solitary wonder on the south side of the hill. Dead fall and broken branches cover the hollow and is home for a family of thick furred marmots. The dark brown colored rodents stare out of the dark recesses of the dead branches with shiny black eyes. A brace of buck-toothed, adolescent marmots scramble for cover as the shrill cry of a hawk sounds further up the mountain.

Thicker stalked grasses grow here on this high plateau where the air is rarified and rain spills quickly down the small rocky gullies. A few staunch oaks grow alone or in groups of one or two, their roots exposed where they cling to the rocky soil for sustenance. Thin, scraggly junipers suck up what little moisture the soil does manage to hold. The merchant road placidly passes by, untouched by time in the dry environment.

Bright green trees and healthy bushes stand out sporadically on the dusty steppe. The little spring fed islands are surrounded by the blue-green grasses that thrive here. All manner of beasts are drawn to the springs and the protection they offer. Bright blue scrub jays chatter noisily among themselves as they dart and swerve in accomplished aerial feats pursuing their winged insect meals. A small herd of wary jackrabbits stop munching the grass to turn their white ears towards the merchant road. The nearest jack to the road stands on his hind legs and tests the air for any scent of their many predators.

Blending perfectly with the muted hues of the arid surroundings, a lone timber wolf stalks the outer edges of the grassland about a half a mile from the merchant road. The wolf's ears are perked to listen for the rustling of the bushy tailed jack rabbits that thrive in the prairie. The wolf lifts it nose to catch a scent, howls briefly and trots off towards the southeast to catch it's prey from downwind.

As it passes the dry road-bed, it mixes with the warm moist air of the river valley that creeps north and causes dust dervishes that spin their opaque bodies thousands of feet into the air.

The terrain buckles and bends towards the north like a giant rug of trees and rocks had been pushed towards a wall of solid rock.

As the merchant road approaches the western end of the valley, the valley wall abruptly falls away to a sheer drop. Crumbling rock and dirt spill constantly into the deep abyss. Sections of the mountain have slid away into the valley and the merchant road has been rebuilt higher along the steeper sides of the mountain. The fault line of broken rocks continues its path of destruction to the west, skirted by the land-slide prone softer dirt.   A freshly uncovered crevice is here.

A treacherous dusty trail leads west along the shaky fault line from a fork in the main road. The original roadbed has fallen into the chasm years ago, leaving the merchants to their own wiles to ply the slippery slopes past the fault zone. Many attempts have failed at conquering the shifting dirt and rocks. Currently a bumpy trail skirts the bigger rocks and loose gravel.

The narrow roadbed slopes precariously towards the long drop to the jagged rocks.  Loose gravel and dirt coat the slippery trail and sift constantly into the deep abyss making the air down in the deep valley seem thick. No breeze stirs from the drop-off and the valley is choked with haze.

Cutting across a wide debris path, the merchant road is barely discernible from the hemorrhage of slowly decaying mountain.  Small footprints track across the torpid river but disappear within hours. To the north, a landmark of sorts allows travelers a point from which to reconoiter their path. A mount of rocks that resembles the beak of a large bird marks the northern rim of the crater. Southbound traffic must rely on their wits to reach the badlands beyond the chasm.

A tenacious layer of solid rock shoots across the shifting dirt like a line of markers. The merchant road dutifully travels the steeper slope so that wagon wheels, shod hooves and boots can take advantage of the additional purchase on the slippery canyon rim. Through the hazy dust down inside the chasm walls, broken wagons, large animal skeletons and various smashed boxes and barrels grimly display the dangerous conditions of the trail.

The straight line of nubby, hard bedrock fortifies a cliff that dangles thousands of feet above the shifting gravel of the chasm.  Across the dusty valley, magnificent granite cliffs shoulder a pass through the snow topped mountains. The merchant road follows the perilous cliff, with precious little room more than the width of a wagon pulled by a team of oxen.

The trecherous path holds steady through the loose rock and gravel, following the old dead backbone of rocks that travel from east to west.  Exposed tree roots demonstrate the speed of the valleys erosion. Two huge pine trees lean to the north, stalwart in their last attempts to hang onto the mountainside with just half of their roots.   A tall ancient pine tree and a towering ancient pine tree are here.

Wide, deep stairs mark a change in elevation for the merchant road. Chopped by sheer brute strength from the crumbling mountainside, the slippery granite steps pose a difficult traverse for wheeled transports of all kinds. Although they are shallow, the steps jar spokes and strain axles as the wagons are slowly dropped down or levered up the incline.

Slippery, decomposing granite covers the narrow roadbed causing heavy objects like loaded wagons to skitter sideways from the weight.  Steel pegs and pitons have been pounded into the boulders overhead for added security and the experienced drivers run safety lines from team to wagon, and on down the line.   A rusty anchored steel cable is here.

The merchant road is unrecognizable on this trek across the vast, disintegrating cliff face of the Tarath Bends.

Several old split planks placed end to end are propped between the rock shelf and the lower, to the southwest. Four shaggy mules balk at stepping on the cracking planks as the weight of an over-loaded canvas covered wagon bows the boards to the breaking point. The sweating drover is standing on his brakes, his hands clenched in white knuckled fists on the eight reins. Several caravan guards grab the halters of the mules and attempt to haul them forward.    Some greying oak planks are here.

What once was the intersection of two roads is now a single road paralleled by a massive amount of rock, mud and timber. A new landslide covers the older settled debris making passage to the northeast impossible. Rocks and pebbles lay across the path making movement precarious. The new landslide still groans and shifts ever so slightly.

Old trees lay side by side with the massive boulders of the mountain, intermingling in a terrible landslide. The mountain top has broken off and slid across the eastern road stopping all forms of transportation. It would take years for mortal hands to remove the tons of stone from the original roadway to make it passable once again. Thankfully, nature has changed the landscape for the better, and has opened a gap through the mountain to the north.

The mountains of the Great Divide stretch to the north and west as far as the eyes can see. Snow tipped peaks glisten in the daylight hours and sparkle under the stars at night. Large clouds hang above the peaks moving in the upper currents.

Up above this portion of road the pathway turns back toward the east. From the edge of the road one can stare upward and follow that part of the road til it bends once again to the west. Though the distance from here to there isnt great, what lies past that is only a guess.

Far upward and northwest a massive tower stands near the peak of the mountain. Massive clouds float at its base blocking whatever route to the tower from view. The towers single spire gleams brightly, the silver polished heavily. Not much more can be assertained about the tower from this position.

The road underfoot is black and marred, its surface covered with sticky soot and ash. A large water stain stretches from a hole high over head, down the eastern mountain face, and over the road edge to the area below. A few brackish puddles stand on the roads surface, smelling strangely like animal waste.

Another massive boulder, black and melted, blocks any further passage toward the top of the mountain. Thick grey and white clouds hang heavily near the edge of the road, swirling ever so slightly in the breeze. There is no way to continue up the mountain except perhaps by climbing the sheer cliff wall. The clouds pulse slightly and gravitate toward the road surface, the sound of thunder rolling over the area.

A ribbon of pure silver stretches out through the billowing clouds toward the peak of the mountain. Each step is like walking on soft carpeting but without any solid underfooting to hold one up. Any movement on the silver strand makes the surface flow like the waves on the ocean, rippling into the distance.

The strand twists and stretches and in some parts is not entirely there. Large holes open and close on its surface but without fail passage over these rifts is made without any problems. Above and surrounding the strand, the billowing clouds make up the walls of a silky tunnel, flickering with light and the sounds of rolling thunder every so often. The tunnel leads east to a solid mountain roadway and west into a blur.

The strand and tunnel end abruptly before you, dispersing in the strong wind that blows down from the mountain. The next steps will have you hundreds of feet above the mountain base, standing on nothing but air, all solid footing gone. Across this long gap, on its otherside, the silver strand and the cloud tunnel begin again, making their way toward the mountain tower.

[Sky.]

There is nothing here but the open expanse of sky. A silvery walkway ends quite close to the east, its semi-solid footing welcome to most who cannot fly. Far northeast another part of the strand waits for a traveler to set foot on its surface to continue the journey up the mountain. A strong wind blows down from the mountain peak, attempting to bring the massive drop to the ground quickly and painfully to anyone stupid enough to wander out into the sky.

[Sky.]

Nothing but sky and mountains stretch out on all sides. The drop from this height would surely be deadly to anyone. A sliver of silver glints in the distance, rolling slightly within a wall of clouds. To the northeast, as if floating in the sky, a large tower hovers under it's own power. A small white curl of smoke reaches out from the tower towards the small silver path.  Some alabaster upwards leading stairs are here.

The narrow silver strand bends and stretches as it begins again. Billowing clouds part long enough for one to glimpse the entire southern half of Tarath Bends in all of its majesty. Though the strand carries its travelers higher above the mountain, the walk itself acts as if one were walking a level roadway.

[The Crystal Tower.]

A massive purple crystal tower soars overhead, its silver spire polished to a bright shine. The walls pulse slightly as if beating like a massive heart. The mountain peak rises high on either side of the building, cradling the tower in its grasp. A massive gate protects the tower interior from any who do not belong.   An open silver-trimmed purple crystal gate is here.

This room is illuminated.
In the room are Dezzaray the Leuian and Emped the Drag-al (holding a flaming wooden torch).

[The Crystal Tower.]

A massive purple crystal tower soars overhead, its silver spire polished to a bright shine. The walls pulse slightly as if beating like a massive heart. The mountain peak rises high on either side of the building, cradling the tower in its grasp. A massive gate protects the tower interior from any who do not belong.   An open silver-trimmed purple crystal gate, some gold coins, some silver coins, a quiver of oak arrows, a worn leather money belt, and some copper banded gauntlets are here.

The strand widens toward the base of the tower, its silver-black surface reflecting the purple light from the walls. The tower is now completely in view, its walls not just glowing purple, but made of some sort of deep purple crystal magickally infused with a glowing light. There is but a single entrance gate and one narrow window slit high above the ground noticeable with a first glance. The silver spire hums slightly giving off a beautiful tune.

At the tip of the spire, glowing bright purple, stands a beautifully crafted scarab, its outstretched wings glistening silver.

Nothing but sky and mountains stretch out on all sides. The drop from this height would surely be deadly to anyone. A sliver of silver glints in the distance, rolling slightly within a wall of clouds. To the northeast, as if floating in the sky, a large tower hovers under it's own power. A small white curl of smoke reaches out from the tower towards the small silver path.  Some alabaster upwards leading stairs are here.

There is nothing here but the open expanse of sky. A silvery walkway ends quite close to the east, its semi-solid footing welcome to most who cannot fly. Far northeast another part of the strand waits for a traveler to set foot on its surface to continue the journey up the mountain. A strong wind blows down from the mountain peak, attempting to bring the massive drop to the ground quickly and painfully to anyone stupid enough to wander out into the sky.

The strand twists and stretches and in some parts is not entirely there. Large holes open and close on its surface but without fail passage over these rifts is made without any problems. Above and surrounding the strand, the billowing clouds make up the walls of a silky tunnel, flickering with light and the sounds of rolling thunder every so often. The tunnel leads east to a solid mountain roadway and west into a blur.

Another massive boulder, black and melted, blocks any further passage toward the top of the mountain. Thick grey and white clouds hang heavily near the edge of the road, swirling ever so slightly in the breeze. There is no way to continue up the mountain except perhaps by climbing the sheer cliff wall. The clouds pulse slightly and gravitate toward the road surface, the sound of thunder rolling over the area.

A small crack in the road spills forth a small stream of dirty brown water. Nearer the road edge, close to the drop down the mountain side, the erosion is terrible. In time, if the flow of water continues, the road may wash away without much of a trace.

Small birds fly high overhead, circling this part of the road. The span from the edge of the road to the southern mountain face is not very far, however the drop into the valley would be suicide. On that mountain side a small cave yawns its opening next to a narrow ledge. Perhaps one could jump down to it without falling to their death...

High above the mountain base the roadway makes its climb toward the peak. Down below the cliff falls off suddenly into the valley.

This newly constructed road begins the climb to the mountain peaks as a vein from the main Rathan-Fort Tarath artery. Following the steep incline of the mountain's side, this twisting path travels its way to the opposite side of the City of Rathan. High above in that part of the mountain, a single silver-spired tower peaks through the misty mountain air and glistens slightly.

Old trees lay side by side with the massive boulders of the mountain, intermingling in a terrible landslide. The mountain top has broken off and slid across the eastern road stopping all forms of transportation.

Thankfully, nature has changed the landscape for the better, and has opened a gap through the mountain to the north.

Along the path of the merchant road are markers of stacked rocks to indicate the correct way over the flat, granite dome. For miles, gray to white polished granite dominates the rock-topped landscape with one exception. A few paces off the roadway, the hard rock dips into a small ditch that is strewn with broken rocks and marked by dark recesses. The wind whips several gossamer filaments of light stringy material out of the darker region of the ditch.

To the north, a landmark of sorts allows travelers a point from which to reconoiter their path. A mount of rocks that resembles the beak of a large bird marks the northern rim of the crater. Southbound traffic must rely on their wits to reach the badlands beyond the chasm.

Sections of the mountain have slid away into the valley and the merchant road has been rebuilt higher along the steeper sides of the mountain. The fault line of broken rocks continues its path of destruction to the west, skirted by the land-slide prone softer dirt.   A freshly uncovered crevice is here.

Pack animals and travelers alike stop momentarily and then hasten their pace as if to leave the quake behind them.

A short vibration shudders the roadbed, causing dust and gravel to shimmy down the canyon walls. A few larger rocks ping and ricochet off boulders, until all is deadly silent.  The merchant road is dusted with bits of broken rock, covering any recent tracks.

The momentous forces that have wrought this valley still press upon the land and have done so for eons.  The walls of the valley are sheer and steep, and untouched by the raging waters of river or stream.  As if in testimony to the power of the forces that move the land, a huge dark boulder sits off to the side of the road. It is hewn in half like a sliced melon.  One part sits 20 feet north along the break in the rocks from the other part.

One layer of rock in the steep walls has eroded faster then the harder granite or bedrock above and below it. Soft sandstone has been stripped away to form an arch in the valley wall ... a concave indention that goes for hundreds of feet in both directions.  Within the hardened sediment left ages ago upon the land are treasures beyond value: fossilized shells by the thousands, in all sizes, shapes and colors.  A sandstone blue scaled fish fossil, a dusty green spiral leaf fossil, and a multi toothed jaw bone fossil are here.

The merchant road threads through bottom of the small, narrow valley. Sheer granite walls block the view from the well traveled road to either side and above, only a narrow ray of sky testifies to the time of day. The engineers set a route as far as possible from the broken stones in the center of the valley and, by luck or design, this foresight has saved the road-bed from constant reconstruction. Small cracks run parallel to the road, but none have broken through the thick layers of sand and stone.

The merchant road cuts straight through a hill where men and beasts must have toiled to remove tons of blasted rock and dirt. The choice to remove hundreds of feet of hillside was more prudent to the road engineers then a long series of switch-backs that would have to climb the steep hillside for hundreds of feet. Tube shaped holes drilled into the bedrock still remain from when the roadbed was blasted eons years ago.

Blending perfectly with the muted hues of the arid surroundings, a lone timber wolf stalks the outer edges of the grassland about a half a mile from the merchant road.

The wolf lifts it nose to catch a scent, howls briefly and trots off towards the southeast to catch it's prey from downwind.

All manner of beasts are drawn to the springs and the protection they offer. Bright blue scrub jays chatter noisily among themselves as they dart and swerve in accomplished aerial feats pursuing their winged insect meals. A small herd of wary jackrabbits stop munching the grass to turn their white ears towards the merchant road. The nearest jack to the road stands on his hind legs and tests the air for any scent of their many predators.

Running parallel to the road is a smooth rock lined trench that channels the road's run-off during rainstorms. This flat part of the road that follows the valley floor would be prone to turn into a muddy bog and therefore a hazard to most caravans and their pack animals. Anticipating this event, the road's engineers built drains into the lower side of the road that carry the runoff into the culvert, which carries it harmlessly down to the low end of the valley.

Water loving trees hug the river's course through the low lying valley. Giant beech and huge alders vie for the valuable sodden shoreline and shade the understory bushes and ferns from direct sunlight. The result is a lushly green, verdant forest that obscures the river from the view on the road, though the hiss of rushing water reveals it's course.

The decaying remains of the bridge workers camp sprawls across this flat valley. To house their draft beasts, the workers constructed small stalls and shelters from rickety boards nailed quixotically to the standing trees. Three brass ring topped posts lie sunk into the grasslands turf, to the south, which was most likely used for tethering grazing animals. Between the posts is a rough stone trough that is filled automatically with water by a rickety mechanical wind mill, whirling lazily in the breeze.

Boulders stacked in pyramids contained by large timbers stand mutely to the side of the roadway next to an impromptu dump of broken tools, wooden stakes and empty buckets lined with mortar. Deeply grooved sled tracks lead to the east towards the bridge from this part of the road where the flatness of the valley was best suited for the staging area during the bridge's reconstruction. Smooth rectangles of tent foundations still mark their location in a semi circle around a blackened fire ring where the workers and their supervisors lived during it's rebuilding.

On the northern edge of the road stands a tall, flat rock. Chipped into the shape of a pillar and abraded to smoothness, it bears the stamped surveyor's mark of the road's builder. The mark's grooved letters are filled with sand and dust and obscured from age, but the arrows delineating north, south, east and west are clear and easy to read. The rest of the stamp is undecipherable and lends mystery to the road's origin.

A brown and white osprey soars above the raging river, scanning the water for a meal. Suddenly, it dives down to the surface and snatches a rather large trout from the water. The trout wriggles helplessly in the large birds grip as it is carried off to a nest of sticks and twigs high in the distant treetops.

Withstanding seasonal floods and constant traffic, the durable road shows how affective good design and competent construction can be. It travels a hand paved berm straight to an imposing grey stone bridge to the southeast. The pilons of the bridge are cloaked in river mist as the raging river sweeps by. Only the brightness of the fluttering flags that top the spans stand out sharply.

A massive stone bridge spans a raging grey tinted river as it runs it's course towards the southeast. The mud around the bridge footings has been churned by wheels of quarry wagons, tracks of sleds bearing block and tackle, shod hooves of draft beasts and booted feet of masons and bridge workers. The newer parts of the huge bridge are obvious due to the contrast in colors of mortar and rock. Bright banners snap briskly in the wind from both ends of the bridge.  A broken wooden wagon is here.

Mismatched mortar colors and varying types and cuts of the stone show the extent of the reconstruction made by quick working masons. A few proud workers chiseled their initials and the date into their handiwork, most reading the date of Rinannimas, 6th month, 61st day, year 313. Bright banners flutter in the breeze on both sides of the bridge as if in celebration of its victory over both the river's truculence and sabotage.

The massive stone bridge expands over the raging river, it's huge pilons buried deep in the river's bottom. Within sight and just downstream, the water rushes past what remains of the old bridge, causing dangerous under-currents. Bright red bouys mark the broken fragments locations and signs tell of the peril. The river pilots earn their pay negotiating this treacherous obstacle.

Just to the north, the roadway curves gently around a bend in a large river that flows towards the southeast. An enormous smooth round rock splits off a small eddy from the main current resulting a deep, clear pool by the eastern side of the road. The cool calm water catches the reflection of the white snowcapped mountain range further up the valley while the river rushes past towards Spur. Five fishermen recline on folding chairs or against rocks, tethered by the silvery lines of their poles to the fishing hole. Each fisherman is spread evenly around the pool as if held apart by some invisible barrier as they eye the large shadowy fish shapes finning effortlessly against the mild current in the eddy.

The worn merchants road travels the southern side of a low hill in one wide arc. The broad path is slightly banked to accomodate for the turn and incline. On the exposed side of the road, the sturdy road-bed is exposed to the elements and yet has remained solid.

Debris from the trees' self-trimming mats the taller grasses into an impenetrable wall. The cypresses produce the necessary windbreak for the field to bear the heavy headed grain.

As the road bends around a curve, ruts left by merchant's wagons cut so deeply into the mud that all wheeled vehicles are forced to follow the set path. Four loaded wagons of a merchants caravan stand idle as one larger than standard wagon skitters along the path. The buckboard's frame groans and strains to keep it inline while the driver attempts to negotiate the turn. Four dark maned, matched mules balk at the noise behind them, and stomp nervously over the deep ruts. The liveried caravan guards attempt to haul the mules forward, further adding to the mules stubborn refusal to move.

Aged and splintered into the vague circular shape, a decaying wagon wheel is left to rot in the grass by the roadside. Their roots protectively sheltered from the weather, idiosyntric sprouts of taller grasses thrive haphazardly inside the wheel. Several tiny holes top small pyramids of sandy debris, where a few red fire ants scout their wagon-wheel domain for fodder.

The road diverts around a small pool of murky water that lies to the north. A confusion of hoof prints muddies the shoreline where the placid bovines have come to water themselves. The pool is damned by a small hillock which allows no drainage so the pool remains stagnant. The mountains to the north reflect in perfectly upside-down symmetry on the still pond's surface, only wavering slightly in concentric circles to the deft touch of small insects.

A rickety criss-crossed rough beam fence pens the grazing of black and white cows whose ponderous forms are barely visible through the tall grass on either side of the road. To the north, the soft, undulating grassland floor of the wide valley succumbs to the rolling foothills, which in turn delineates the imposing outline of a vista-spanning mountain range. Many a traveler has witnessed this idyllic vantage point and has been drawn on to follow the road that travels into the heart of the mountains.

The tall, shaded forest breaks like a green tinged wave upon the tranquil calm of the grasslands. The huge trees within are ancient, reaching hundreds of feet into the air. As if steaming from a great cauldron, a heavy ground fog seeps from deep within the forest carrying with it the fresh smell of decomposing green matter.

Travelers from Rathan to the northwest, and the Trade Route to the south, converge at Spur's west gate. Guards posted on the ground give those seeking to enter the city a cursory once-over. Their lack of interest shows that anyone approaching has already been observed from above for some time. A grate in the ground loosens mud from wagon wheels and hooves before they pass through the gate, helping to keep the streets of Spur fairly clean.  An open giant black iron gate, a giant green oak tree, a small blue pool, a thick oak grate over the pool, and a polished stone marker are here.

Any slow down in the movement of the crowd creates a loud string of curses. The sellers are eager to get to market to get rid of their goods, and the buyers anticipate their purchases.

The bottleneck of carts, merchants and buyers block any exit out of the Bazaar to the north. While it is easy to travel with traffic, trying to move against it is impossible. Those who drive the large wagons that navigate these small streets shout curses and vile threats at each other, hoping it creates a break in traffic and allows them to move forward to their destination.

At this intersection many stands display their exotic foodstuffs. Hanging from large hooks are various unidentifiable hunks of meat, and vegetables of all shapes and colors. The only thing more prevalent than the merchants and buyers are the bugs, who clamor to find the most pungent item to land on. To the northeast a small tent can barely be seen hiding behind the stalls.  A white silk tent and a street lantern are here.

The well-defined Bazaar path heads off to the west. This corner is a mix of the old and the new. On one corner an old stall is barely standing. The roof has caved in, and it quickly becomes apparent that this location has become a local dump. Pieces of wood that look suspiciously like some of the leftovers from other construction sites are piled on top of rotting offal. On the opposite corner a new tent is being erected, its high roof and vivid coloring pleasing to the eye.  An open stall and a street lantern are here.

A new stall has been hastily constructed on this site, in the shadow of the large Spurian Wall. Most chose to build well within the Bazaar as opposed to this outer path. Low-grade wood and bent nails make up this sorry excuse for a business establishment. A small sign on the front has a crude picture of a key on it, and the name, "Skugz."

Two large Oog-ra guards refuse to allow anyone to continue south. With loud gestures and over exaggerated pointing, they send wagons to the east or back north. With some slapping of backs, and happy grins, they congratulate themselves on following directions.

An old Thugian pulls and pushes a very stubborn donkey. Neither end seems to be cooperating with his demands.

A heated discussion breaks out briefly between members of opposing orders of magick. The presence of the city guard rapidly brings an end to the exchange before the verbal debate over power and skill turns into a demonstration.  A street lantern is here.

Knowledge Path terminates here at the gateway to the Magick District. In respect to the demands of the various religious and guild leaders, magick is kept as far from them as possible. A city plagued by rioting mage haters is the last thing Spur needs.  A street lantern is here.

You are just inside the gateway between the Magick District and the Town Square. These gates stand open at all hours of the day or night. An otherwise unremarkable door is glorified by the sign of the city's healer posted beside it.  A wooden door and a street lantern are here.

A massive circular stone platform stands to the side of Magick Lane, strangely entrancing runes carved on every inch of its sides. The symbol of the god Sa, a golden Dragon, fills the space along the top. Raw power and magick seem to flow from the platform, making the air around it crackle with energy. A small sign stands next to the platform with a single word written upon it.  A rune covered platform, a floating blue ruby staircase leading down, and a street lantern are here.

A low slung building resides on the west side of the street. Chanting can be heard from within.  Occasionally a few sparks rise into the sky, or some unwarranted raindrops begin, but they quickly are quelled. A large pair of wooden doors, their surface carved with rune symbols grace the entrance.  A street lantern and some open rune-etched wooden doors are here.

>[Mage Training.]

A large room is filled with young magi trying frantically to take control of their runes. A young water mage apologizes profusely to the older fire mage who had a nice spell going, up until the backfire of water put it out. Instructors shake their head and attempt to put aright any mistakes. Singe spots, puddles, strange piles of rocks and dirt, and uncontrolled winds all mix in an eclectic mess, but those learning would have it no other way. When all the elements come together there is a strength that is unmistakable.  Some open rune-etched wooden doors are here.

A squat ugly little shack stands somber on the eastern side of this well swept lane. The occasional high pitched cackle sounds out from the shack, garnering strange looks from all who pass by. A mysterious gothic structure rises up on the opposite side of the street, the occasional explosion thundering out from within its doors, followed by muffled curses and breaking glass.  An open thick iron door, a closed ugly rotting door, a rotting oak sign, and a street lantern are here.

Darkness and mystery cover every part of this crowded room. Flasks and bottles, full of anything imaginable, lie scattered in a chaotic mess on tables and shelves. Hanging from one corner is the dried out body of some unknown creature. Smoke of all colors rise from beakers that are carefully being heated. Old and dusty tomes are haphazardly stacked several feet high, and threaten to fall at the slightest touch. A red-eyed white cat sits patiently in a windowsill, watching the old Alchemist with quiet interest.  An open thick iron door and an ingredient list are here.

The master alchemist says, "The dust is made from grinding the bones of the dead is used in a number of arcane rituals by necromancers and those of their kind, it is also quite useful for a number of potions of alchemy."

A small sign hangs from above the door of the well-kept store before you, telling you that it is a rune shop. The occasional bright flash of light from inside the store suggests all kinds of strange and rare magicks are being cast inside! Those who walk past you glance at the rune shop warily and hurry to get past it as quickly as possible. A small sign hangs from the doorknob of the store that reads "Flerians not allowed!"  An intricately carved oak door and a street lantern are here.

A small garden of strange plants and spices grows before a small store. The aromas from the objects planted within the garden are intoxicating; they tug at your senses in a confusing attack of reactions. You feel as if you want to sneeze, cough, breathe in and breathe out all at the same time. A stone path cuts through the center of the garden leading to the front door of the shop.  A small wooden door and a street lantern are here.

Dried, cooked, boiled and washed, different herbs sit in boxes upon the counter with prices and information telling of what magical quality the herb or leaf possesses. The smells from the plants of the herbalist seem to have seeped into the walls and ceiling of the small store, everything in the store smells of spice. How anyone could bear to stay in this shop and not have their allergies drive them slowly insane, you can only wonder.  A weathered wooden sign and a small wooden door are here.
