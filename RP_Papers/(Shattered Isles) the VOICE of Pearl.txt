Shattered Isles

[The VOICE of Pearl.]

A cluttered room filled with stacks of raw papers and small barrels of ink is separated in half by a long wooden counter. Behind the counter, writing desks and trash bins overflowing with paper barely leave any room to walk. Workers with sweat-stained shirts gulp coffee as they prepare the latest edition for delivery. Customers come and go through the glass door entrance while a smaller green door leads to the editor's office. A small box set into the office door allows letters to be deposited after business hours. You notice an open green office door, an engraved cherrywood sign, a small tin deposit box, and an open white oak-framed glass entrance.

Also here: an ink-covered scribe 

Obvious Exits: none
=================================
[The VOICE of Pearl, Office.]

The small office is filled with strange and exotic tomes in many languages stacked upon the floor. The wooden walls are covered with various hand drawn faded maps and old newspaper clippings. A set of cluttered wooden shelves full of jars of ink and stacks of reports line the entire eastern side of the office. The huge teak desk centered in front of the back wall is cluttered, almost buried under sheaves of letters and stacks of books and lexicons in every known tongue. A small window and several lamps, lit day and night, make the small dingy room seem almost cheery. You notice an open green office door, a small glass window, 500 doubloons, an ink-stained teak desk, and a letter.

Obvious Exits: none

~Ode to the Longest Night~

You may write us down in history
With your bitter, twisted lies,
You may trod us in the very dirt
But still, like earth-dust, We'll rise.

Did you want to see us broken?
Bowed head and lowered eyes?
Rain falling down like Kaleith's teardrops.
Weakened in our soulful cries.

You may shoot us with your words,
You may cut us with your eyes,
You may kill us with your hatefulness,
But still, like air, We'll rise.

Out of the depths of history's flame
We rise
Up from a past that's rooted in pain
We rise

We're a deep ocean, leaping and wide,
Welling and swelling we bear in the tide.
Leaving behind nights of terror and fear
We rise

Into a daybreak that's wondrously clear
In the Light, We rise
Through the Longest Night of the year,
In the Shadows, We Rise
Bringing the gifts that our ancestors gave,
We are the dream and the hope of the slave.

We rise!
We rise!
We rise!
***********************
Rise UP people of Pearl,
On this Longest of Nights!

______________The Solstice Celebration__________________

The Longest night is celebrated by many cultures and religions,
and in many various ways. To many tribal peoples, the Solstice
can have a great significance, and play an important part in their
belief systems. To those of a more arcane or magical nature, the
use of sacrificial animals can sometimes lend power to the spells
that are conjured during this time. For those who follow the path of
Shadow, the festival known as Saw'Hain is traditionally celebrated
on this night, and is considered by some as a time to celebrate the lives of
those who have passed on, and it often involves paying respect to ancestors,
family members, elders of the faith, friends, pets, and other loved ones
who have died. In some rituals the spirits of the departed are invited to
attend the festivities. It is seen as a festival of darkness, and the use of costumes
ensures that the envious spirits will not cause Harm to those who appear as they do.....

The staff of the VOICE of Pearl wishes you a safe and dreadful evening,
and reminds you .... don't trod upon other people's beliefs.... lest their
beliefs trod upon YOU!

Zephyrous Edition
vol 1, ed 1

Eleventh..........Aerthanian Temple Meeting, 21st bell
Eleventh..........Kaleithan Temple Meeting, 20th bell

Seventeenth ... Tetherian Temple Meeting, half past the 20th bell
Nineteenth....... Closed Conclave Meeting, 21st bell
========================================================

~Pearlean Report~

The Conclave has given Emissary Bouldermoore permission to extend his destruction of
nature and forest further outside the city, to the areas of Three Bridges, and Rum Village,
thereby ensuring a stronger foothold for the Archai Trading Company in these areas.

Meanwhile work by members of Temple Tetherias and the mages and healers of the King
has seen some success with the cleansing of Rum Village, and parts of the Stirling Forest.
Although plague has been contained and eradicated in these areas, it still behooves one
to carry the odd potion or two of cure.....just in case. Wolves from the Stirling Forest have
been worst affected by the plague, and will attack with little or no provocation, and any
hunters or adventurers with the courage and strength can find Good work in this area.
A typical wolf kill will reward the hunter with three pounds of bone, plus meat and pelts.
Rumors of other paths in these areas have been heard, and scouts are investigating.

~ Longest Night Aftermath~

The people of Pearl have made it known to the King and Conclave that they have a voice,
and that should any forget, even the lowliest citizen has a right to express themselves.
Some of that self expression took on the form of sadistic practices involving animals, and
the possible spreading of disease within the city, and the request for a Clinic to address such
possibilities seemed a logical one. However .... Members of the All Knowing Conclave seemed to
regard this proposal by Emissary Renley as worthless, and voted to disallow any medical building
within the city. Perhaps the Conclave will change it's mind when Pearl is ravaged by the plague that
seems to have overtaken almost all the rest of the Isle.

As for the culprit in this situation, a thousand doubloons has been offered for any information leading
to the arrest or capture of said individual, though so far, no one seems to know anything.
The VOICE of Pearl has also been implicated in these events, even though no direct evidence points
to the fact that championing free will and free speech leads to chaos. Please forgive the quality of paper
that the next few editions shall be printed upon, as the staff is currently in hiding, and resources are limited.

Several Temples were targeted during the Longest Night, and as a result, Templars have been able to find gainful
employment within the city. Most Temples now sport a Templar or two, and it is said other security measures
have been put into place, most notably at the Royal Palace.

~ About Town~

The ATC has opened an office in the city, and all but the followers of Kaleith will be looking forward to the
increase in mercantile business brought on by such happenings.

Several local priests have been seen stepping through magical portals within the city, giving rise to
the notion that one or more of them has experimented enough to unlock this magical means of
transportation. Hopefully local mages can supply the priests with training so that they don't open
a portal to anywhere ..... dangerous.

~Rumor's Corner~

Local thieves have been busy, and many look to Temple Itzal for answers as rumors abound about
kidnappings, temple desecrations, and slanderous statements about respected citizens. Many partnerships
and marriages seem to be wavering, and as a general feeling of Malaise sweeps through the streets,
one has to wonder if the once happy populace is being subjected to darker forces of some kind.
The lack of social events has some worried that Pearl may be losing some of it's luster, while memories
of the splendor of the festival celebrating Archai's Renewal still linger, and many eyes turn towards
the sea, and far off islands....

Be on the lookout for the next edition of....

 notes for Jan:
 conclave, lodge, alumni day, jewelry peddle(Charlat relics ?)

____________________________________
UPDATE
The Conclave met last night after it's winter hiatus, and in
true political fashion accomplished.... not much. A proposal put
forward by Nikolas Suyessod-Taqqi for the opening of a cultural
foods establishment met with sound approval ( who doesn't like food?),
after which Emissary Ayderias proposed that the Conclave better establish
it's roll in Pearlean society by way of preparing a document that defines the
responsibilities and purpose of the Conclave. This was met with vehement opposition
from The Emissary of Astraeva, Eleanora, who despite being a follower of the Light
seemed to think that the Conclave's powers should be left shrouded in Darkness.
More to come after the closed door meeting on the twenty eighth of this month,
however not all the news was so disappointing.
Merchant Ernest Bouldermoore of the Land and Sea Property exchange announced
that his crews had ravaged more hitherto untouched woodlands to the north in
Stirling forest, and that a path now lies open in that direction. Caution is urged
to all travelers in this area as some of the beasts , although rich in natural resources,
can be quite dangerous when aroused.
A young Vukasin appeared late in the evening's proceedings and gave mention of
clandestine meetings by citizens not present, namely Prelate Trystan of Aerthane,
Ra'daji Garaven Azahar of temple Tetherias and his wife, the famous card player
Rochiriel , and a mysterious Devalin, who some believe to have been Empyrion Bocon
of the temple of Pyrous. One can only wonder what agenda these individuals have that
supercedes such an important event as the Conclave's first meeting of the new year.

Local law enforcement is still on the lookout for a suspected murderer and thief, though
no mention has been made publicly by the Knight Marshal's office as to the identity of said
individual. Citizens should be on the lookout for any suspicious activity, and keep their
coinpouches hidden till the situation has been resolved.
Even though , as was mentioned during the Conclave meeting, one cannot be prosecuted
for associating with known criminals, one should be aware that questioning by the Knight Marshal's
office would be a real and imminent possibility.

We at the VOICE would also like to remind you that there is a peddle tonight by the
Merchant Vogrok Silverforge, who will be taking orders for custom shields at ten bells.
Merchant Silverforge's work is without equal, and citizens would do well to show up early,
as the demand for his skilled craftwork is high.

As always, Stay free and Speak Your Mind!

UUpcomming temple meetins

The Voice of Pearl, in conjunction with the mysterious Religious Council,
would like to remind our readership that several local Temples will be having
meetings this week, and all the faithful are urged to attend. Times are as follows...

Twentythird:
... Temple of Pyrous - ten bells

Twentyfifth:
... Temple of Astraeva - eight bells
:: a line has been scratched out::

Twentysixth:
::a line has been scratched out::
... Temple of Teherias - half past nine bells

The Temple of Aerthane has already had their monthly gathering,
and with the conclusion of the remaining meetings, the plans made by the Religious Council
should should soon be put into effect. This recent upsurge in temple activity will be
noted by the King, whose pet project (the Conclave) stands to lose momentum
in the arena of political power.

More information will be made available as soon as current temple meetings are complete.

Recent events

Bolinau Bodies Found on Conclave doorstep!
____________________________________

On the twenty-eighth of this month before the closed door Conclave
meeting, evidence of ghastly murder was found at the Conclave
chamber doors. The bodies of Bolinau, along with an ominous note greeted
shocked Conclave members as they gathered for their evening session.
No word as yet on the contents of the note, or if there are any suspects,
but two local citizens, the Verdani mage Rochiriel Azahar, and the Sylph healer
Xiija Anzu have been called for questioning. Possibly the Religious Council is
sacrificing two of it's members to make a point to the pompous Conclave,
or perhaps the two have simply gone on an insane killing spree.
There is still no posting of the closed door meeting notes, and many speculate
that the Conclave has been shaken to it's very roots by the event.

In other news, orders from the shield peddle by Vogrok Silverforge, and jewelry
orders from the Bolinau merchant Charlat Reycroft are being eagerly awaited by
many citizens. No doubt the Bolinau merchant will be accompanied by armed
guards when next she visits the semi lawless city of Pearl.

Several adventurers have been seen frequenting the newly opened paths in the heart
of the Stirling forest, and the price of bone is expected to drop due to a large surplus
of the resource from that area being dumped on local bone buyers.

Air mage and hunting lodge owner Blink Walkabout has created a new card game that
is sweeping the isand, and it is rumored that he will be opening a gambling establishment soon.
It will be interesting to see if the ATC can get it's greedy fingers into That pie!

More news when the questionings have concluded and meeting notes have been posted.

Shopping Update:

The Academy, in conjunction with the ATC and local merchants has recently
restocked it's student-oriented stores with goods from all over the Isle .
This move comes right before the eagerly awaited Alumni Day, and those
wishing to learn more about becoming a merchant should pay close attention
to the heavy taxation placed on the new items. A shirt that once went for
fourteen doubloons now sells for two hundred fourty.... a markup twenty times
the cost of the original item!
...We at the Voice can only hope that someone will open a thrift store to sell the
old stock to the semi-starving students at a decent price.

Breaking news

Alumni Day, sponsored by Temple Aerthane, was a huge success
as adventurers from all over the Isle were treated to demonstrations,
food, drink, and important information. The evening started out with
Prelate Trystan Rivalen opening the festivities and then turning the podium
over to the Khalsat Faran Fairuz-Taqqi, who provided lucky adventurers with a demonstration
of the culinary arts as well as incredibly well stocked cooking kits, complete
with a recipe book. This was followed by a skinning demonstration by hunting lodge owner
Blink Walkabout, with the aid of Wynestra Renley. Following the skinning of several
large beasts, Merchant Zykiel Blythe took the podium to enlighten citizens on how
they might join the ranks of the ATC as a merchant. The evening concluded with
the Aerthanian Emissary Ayerdias Clarveu reading from his personal family journals
relating to the origins of Itzal and Astraea, and the following creation of a Goblin City.

The Emissary's reading was interrupted by several large earthquakes which shook the
entire small Academy Isle and collapsed the festival tent. Thankfully all citizens were able
to vacate it before it came crashing down. No word yet on if the ale was saved.

The following day the Academy once again played host to citizens, as the merchant
Elmere Manske was to hold a scavenger hunt during the evening hours, but the event was
interrupted by another wave of quakes, each more severe in strength than the last.
A citizen of Outlast arrived in town having escaped injury from quakes and Ice Trolls which
he claimed to have seen running rampant after being forced from their frosty lair, and asked for
help for his village.

The scavenger hunt was immediately cancelled and a large party was formed to investigate the
strange happenings. The group headed north along the route to Outlast, but were assailed by
frequent ground shaking and falling boulders the size of small houses. Accounts vary, but from what we have
been able to learn, the party met and defeated several bands of trolls before becoming trapped in the very
caves the trolls had vacated. Rumors of gigantic creatures and fabulous wealth, as well as a certain merchant
being eaten whole, and then cut from the belly of one such beast, still alive, seem to be too fantastic to be true.

Some adventurers were trapped in various areas by the earth slides but were rescued or made their way to safer ground.
Several theories have been put forward as to the cause of the night's events - Some say the Gods were angry,
some claim that it was merely a natural event, forces of nature, and a few even have postulated the the giant
creatures from the ice caves have been burrowing all through the small island, and that the tidal waves merely aided in
causing the hole riddled island to break in twain. Regardless of the cause, the fact remains, Outlast is now unreachable
by land, and a large drop off now occupies the path north of the guard station there. It may be possible to reach
the citizens of Outlast by boat, and a few enterprising ferrrymen have even been seen surveying the area.
All citizens are cautioned to use care when visiting these areas and be on the lookout for stranded travelers.

In other news, members of the mysterious Religious Council have been seen gathering more frequently, and it
is assumed that it wont be long until they start to assert their power within the city. It is unknown at this time
whether or not temple Itzal actually Has a temple leader, but by it's very nature, this information would
most likely be hidden by the temple

This news update has been brought to you by the VOICE of Pearl, and various and sundry agencies.

Stay Free and beware of rampaging trolls!

Outlast news

Recent events have hit the small village of Outlast hard.
The earthquakes and tidal waves (which some have called a mini-shattering)
have caused the land mass north of the Academy to break off and become
a small island of it's own. With barely any foragable land and no forest to speak of,
the small village will most likely look to fishing as it's main source of food now.
Several aid missions have been sent to help the people of Outlast and the
villagers seem to be coping fairly well now. A local merchant spice trader has
opened a ferry service to the small island, and one may seek passage at the town
of Three Bridges, just west of the ferry to Rum Village.

Two things of note:

Firstly, the entire area has been sundered from the wards put up by the
Academy, and it is now reachable by portal, path or gate for those with the skill.

Secondly, the Ice Trolls which were routed out of their caves during the shattering seem to
have been affected by the event. They now appear to be twice as huge, and have the strength to match.
Although travelers to the area are warned of the extreme danger posed by the trolls, they seem
to have unearthed fabulous wealth, and would make an excellent expedition for a large group.

We wish the people of Outlast good luck, and hope that our readers will stop by with any
aid they can render at this critical time.

As for the city of Pearl, the merchant Vogrok Silverforge may have been injured in the events,
as his shield deliveries were not completed today, and have been rescheduled for the thirteenth.
The merchant Charlat Reycroft is scheduled to appear on the fifteenth, and the Conclave shall
once again brave the political waters on the eighteenth of this month. We wish them well !

Addendum: The King will be speaking to the citizens of Pearl tonight at eleven bells in the evening from the
palace courtyard, most likely to address recent events and assure the populace that his personal
piggy bank, the ATC, will not be affected by the happenings of the past week. More information will be
released as soon as it is available.

May the VOICE be with you!

The King's Speech

The Pearlean Monarch King Allais Sauntere VIII spoke last night from the balcony of his
royal palace, addressing the citizens of pearl directly instead of through royal decree.
He was surrounded by the Lord Marshall Montague and two Knight Marshals. Marshal Ochir,
and Marshal Cascius, as well as several local constables and marshals in the crowd.

The King spoke briefly about the sundering of the northern part of the academy isle, saying
that it was not the work of nature or beasts, but the wrath of the Gods. The King did not
elaborate on Which Gods were angered, nor what exactly they were angered about, but he was
quick to point out that it seemed to be "our fault" and that "we must make a change".

In the end, it all boiled down to this, the newly created island was named Dolorous Isle, and swiftly
claimed by the King, who promised to "make adequate additions" to the farming community, while
reasserting his personal company's presence, and mentioning that the ATC already has a foothold there
and it will be expanded upon at once. As far as we know, the only shop on the island is a small fletcher who
sells very basic items, hardly ATC materiel , and the only other merchant at all is the ferryman, a spice trader.
It seems as though the King was a bit paranoid that someone would beat him to a new island and all it's resources.

After the King left, taking No questions as is his royal right ( and a most intelligent move, as many would have called
him to the carpet for many of his latest decisions) two of the Knight Marshals made their way into the crowd and attempted
to arrest local healer Xiija Anzu of the Sylph peoples. The wily Sylph evaded capture but the marshals were adamant, and
despite several locals trying to offer her aid, a price was put on her head. Bounty hunters were dispatched with a message
that she is now an outlaw, and to be killed or captured on sight. No word yet on if fellow conspirator Rochiriel Azahar has
also been named Outlaw, or if she has cut a deal with local authorities, despite her acerbic response to the Knight Marshal's scribe.
It should be interesting to see what, if anything, the Conclave makes of all these recent events when it meets upon the eighteenth.

Recent Events
_______________________________

The Knight Marshall's office is still looking for two outlaws, Yiri the Goblin, and
Xiija the Sylph. A reward of seventy five hundred doubloons has been offered
for each, dead or alive... However, if one was to kill either of the two, would one
need to cut off the head and bring it in as proof? If brought in alive, they face public
execution so unless they are trapped, it is most likely they will kill or be killed.

Due to the way the current Pearlean Justice system works, there is only one execution
per outlaw, no matter how many crimes they have committed. This would seem to
imply that criminals may just as well rob, steal and murder to their heart's content
without any regard to how these actions may accumulate against them. It is rumored
that the goblin has already murdered a Tetherian during the ferry trip between the
Academy and Pearl, though no additional charges have been made at his time.

Unless a concerted effort is made by Marshalls and citizens to bring in the outlaws,
they may well be free to continue their reign of terror as long as they wish.


The Conclave meets in a few days, and with the almost unbelievable speed with which
the Ambassador from Pyrous, Thyia Sarantis was accepted as a sitting member ( as compared
to her counterpart Emissary Eldur) it is most likely that other Temples will be sending supplicants
to present themselves for consideration. It should be interesting to see which ones are accepted,
and who will have to apply again and again. Besides a quick note from Conclave member Ernest
Bouldermoore, there have been No meeting notes posted in months, and the need for a Conclave
Scribe position on the Council makes itself felt more and more.

The missive from woodland scout Jerem Kereso seems to have been heard, and a motion was
passed to build a clinic in the Stirling area. Hopefully with medical resources and healers in the area
the paths to the northern reaches of the Island will soon start to open.



In other news:

The Land & Sea Property Exchange has put a hold on construction due to over reaching themselves
in the area of multiple building projects. With many new buildings nearing completion, Master
Bouldermoore has decreed that he will be working on the new Stirling Clinic and a Museum till
at least Hydrem ( six to eight weeks at least) and tying up the housing orders he has been swamped with.

Merchants Zykiel Blythe and Menfanous Hammersmith have rescheduled peddles this month while the more
reliable ATC members Charlat Reycroft and Elmere Mankse have been taking up the slack. The need
for trained apprentices is making itself felt more keenly these days, and with the taxation and profit
available to merchants, it's a wonder that more citizens do not apply for these positions.


In closing, we at the VOICE would like to remind our readers that the City of Pearl is YOU. YOU have to
become more involved, support your local merchants, get involved in community events, speak your
mind at open Conclave meetings. Regardless of the almost oppressive hold that the King has on the Island
the fact remains, without YOU the city would be an empty husk bereft of hope or adventure. Stand the
hell UP and let your thoughts be heard!

Conclave Open Meeting Report

Conclave Meeting : Eighteenth of Lir

The Conclave met tonight in an open meeting and as always, it was a casual affair with plenty
of slap and tickle along with copious amounts af culinary bribery. In attendance were Emissaries
Renley, Bouldermoore, O'Hara, Fairuz-Taqqi, Clarveau, Eldur, and newly seated Sarantis.
Still missing after many months is Emissary Tietjen, leaving Teherias with no representative
on the Conclave.

The evening started with the husband of Emissary Fairuz-Taqqi, one Nikolas Suyessod-Taqqi, putting forth
a written request that his family name be cleared, and the ban on those bearing that name be lifted.
The ban, a lifetime one forbidding anyone with his family name from holding any public office
was set in place due to Suyessod's crime of treason against the Crown. The fact that he was not executed
for such an act speaks volumes in itself, and with no other restrictions or punishments placed upon
him one can only wonder whether privilege or bribery was responsible for such an astounding outcome.

While committing treason and besmirching one's entire family line to escape death may seem to indicate
the character of such an individual, it looks to be the accepted way to do business with the government.
Regardless, the Emissaries seemed to think that Suyessod has paid some kind of penance, and met his
request with apparent approval. If the King can shrug off such a serious crime as treason against the Crown
and offer no punishments at all, it would seem that those accused of murder of lowly citizens may yet
have hope.

Next up were applications for the empty seats on Conclave, namely the seat of Tetherias by Rochiriel Azahar,
( who was until recently wanted by the Knight marshals in connection with the murder of five bolinau citizens),
the second seat of Astraeva, by the merchant Menfanous Hammersmith, and the second seat of Aerthane by local
hunt-lodge owner Blink Walkabout. Hammersmith seemed to breeze through the interviews, while Azahar and Walkabout
both faced extensive questioning, possibly due to their past histories.

Walkabout also put forward a proposal designed to help outlawed citizens who would seek to regain their lawful
status within the city. Given the previously mentioned situation of Suyessod-Taqqi it could be implied that
such a proposal is mostly aimed at the poor and underprivileged, making this proposal's author a hero of the
common people and a true community leader in the eyes of the Voice.

The evening ended abruptly as usual, with Emissaries fleeing the premises due to the lateness of the hour.
Information about which applicants were successful and which were not, along with the status of the proposals
made by Suyessod and Walkabout will be printed after the closed door meeting on the twenty-fifth.

The Voice: Closed Conclave meeting Update

The Pearlean closed Conclave meeting which was scheduled for the twenty-fifth
of this month has been postponed until the twenty-ninth of Lir at eight bells in the
evening by none other than the King himself. One has to wonder what issues under debate
could drag the wily old monarch away from a pleasure cruise aboard his favorite party vessel,
the Iron Gargoyle, upon which it is rumored are several nubile young females eager to ensconce
themselves firmly in the King's favor by whatever means necessary.

The application for open seats would hardly seem an item worthy of such an abrupt move on the
King's part, leading many to believe that the proposals put forth by Blink Walkabout and
Nikolas Suyessod-Taqqi contain wordage that the Royal Presence may seek to approve or quash
with what can only be assumed will be an extreme demonstration of spleen on His Majesty's part.

Conclave member Emissary Faran Fairuz-Taqqi and Conclave hopeful Rochiriel Azahar were quick to
post all manner of pretentious verbal flattery in hopes of influencing the Royal Personage and gaining
favor for their own agendas.

The Voice will continue to monitor these events, keeping our readers informed and updated on all
the political machinations currently sweeping over the city , and hopefully shedding some light on
an otherwise murky situation.

The Conclave of Pearl met on the twenty-ninth of Lir in a closed door session which included
several well known Emissaries, and his Majesty King Allais Sauntere VIII. The Regal monarch
attended the event dressed in bright colored pink tights, and a majestic cape which brought several
questionable looks from those assembled. Allais seemed to be slightly drunk, and his speech was
slurred throughout the entire evening. When questioned about his abrupt return, Sauntere replied
that he couldn't miss the chance of seeing Emissary O'Hara "all done up in her tight dwarvish breeches."

The members overlooked the King's odd behavior and quickly got down to business though, beginning with
the applications for open seats on the council. Whether they were in a foul mood because of His Majesty's
antics, or because no one remembered to bring cookies is anyone's guess, but they unanimously VETOED
ALL applications for seats on the council, with one Emissary in particular remarking, "Let the bastards wait
like I had to !" No word yet on how the applicant's are taking the harsh rebuttal, or if they will still seek to
embark upon the long road to Emissary-ship.

After the application items were addressed the Conclave moved on to the two remaining items on the agenda,
namely a proposal to help outlaws regain citizenship, and a request for a royal pardon. In a surprise move,
His Royal Highness agreed to forgive Nikolas Suyessod-Taqqi for his crime of Treason, and even went so far as to
beg Suyessod-Taqqi to return to the service which he so foolishly abandoned, while slapping him repeatedly upon the
back and scorning the Conclave members, whom he was overheard to insult, saying, " they can't grant pardons, why
the hell did you go to them my boy!"

After the Emissaries had settled down, the final proposal was brought to the table and debated upon for several minutes.
Many seemed to think that letting outlaws regain their citizenship was a lost cause at best, while the King's outlook on it
all was more to the tune of "Can we get any coin from the bastards?" The vote was leaning towards a refusal, but with
the eyes of the Pearlean Monarch upon them, the Conclave voted to accept the proposal provisionally, with said provision
being that all outlaws must pay a reinstatement fee of fifty thousand gold doubloons, and a further "I'm sorry I did it" fee
of thirty thousand doubloons, as well as a criminal tax of twenty five thousand doubloons, which will go directly to the King.

The evening ended with Emissary Bouldermoore and Emissary Renley getting into a food fight, and covering the entire
council chambers in unnamed comestibles that they had secreted about their persons. The King wandered off with
Emissary Faran Fairuz-Taqqi much to the chagrin of her husband , who was seen being consoled by Emissary Sarantis with
the help of a flagon of spiced wine.

So there you have it my friends, your government in action as it were, with all your hopes and dreams in their hands,
(and who knows where those hands have been!) struggling to bring you their knowledge and wisdom such as it is.
One can only hope that the specials offered at the local brothel will compare with the offerings of your Conclave representatives!

The Voice: Closed Meeting and Recent events


 Greetings citizens !
As many of you know, the VOICE of Pearl has come under fire recently for expressing opinions
and bringing information and free speech to those within the city. As such, all future copies of
the VOICE will be available here at the Burning Bandit. Please let your friends and family in the city
know that we have a new home!


Conclave Results:

The Conclave closed door meeting was attended by Emissaries Clarveu, O'Hara, Fairuz-Taqqi, Bouldermoore,
Renley, Eldur , Sarantis and Tietjen as well as the King himself. Though the Royal Monarch usually doesn't
participate in Conclave affairs, His voice was heard on both of the proposals that were presented to the group,
and His Royal Highness even cast a deciding vote in one case. Nikolas Suyessod-Taqqi 's ban has been transmuted
by the King to one of banishment from service to the Crown, though no mention was made of his being ineligible
for government service. Treason it seems is not as bad as a crime as many have been led to believe.

The second proposal, one of an appeals process for criminals, has been modified to allow the Pearlean Conclave
to intercede on the part of such individuals on a case by case basis. The structuring of the proposal by Blink Walkabout,
( a former lawyer among other titles), was cast aside in favor of an open ended and undefined process which will
be handled by the council. The King stated that he would usually support the decisions made in such matters, as long
as it did not interfere with the Knight Marshals and their duties. Outlaws pay heed! ... and break out your doubloons,
as it now seems a bribe or two in the right place might influence any decision rendered for or against you.

The applications for seats on the conclave seem to have benefited from this process of bribery, as ALL the applications
have been hereby accepted. Menfanous Hammersmith was accepted unanimously, as one might expect and Conclave
members will now most likely receive preferential treatment when dealing with the merchant. The Elvish Mage
Rochiriel Azahar also passed muster with only two members showing opposition or indifference. The final applicant
Blink Walkabout passed only by the skin of his teeth, with only half the votes of the council and a great deal of
debate. Time will tell if this decision shall come back to bite the Conclave in the ass, or whether said applicant
can justify their decision on the matter.

In true form, Emissary O'Hara vetoed all matters put before her with the exception of putting one more Dwarvish
butt in a council seat, and Temples Pyrous and Itzal showed great disparity of thought as their Representatives
constantly voted at odds with each other on the issues at hand. Now that the Conclave decisions have been handed
down we can expect to see outlaws seeking lawyers, Suyessod-Taqqi seeking the second seat of Kaleith, and Conclave
seeking a new scribe, as the current one seemed to need a week to transcribe the meeting.
Congratulations to Menfanous Hammersmith, Rochiriel Azahar and Blink Walkabout on their new positions!

Your Current Conclave members are:
_______________________________
Itzal - Ernest Bouldermoore, Wynestra Renley
Pyrous - Thyia Sarantis, Visyn Eldur
Aestraeva - Eleanora O'Hara, Menfanous Hammersmith
Kaleith - Faran Fairuz-Taqqi
Aerthane - Ayderias Clarveau, Blink Walkabout
Tetherias - Tian Tietjen, Rochiriel Azahar



In other news the Outlaw Yiri the Goblin seems to have defeated local Gavial hero Geel Brin in a test of mortal combat.
The self proclaimed leader of the Goblin Horde has stated the he will now be known also as "King of the Gavials" and that
any who wish to oppose him should "Beware". No word yet on if Brin will seek to unseat the newly self appointed King
or if in fact he can physically even do so. Congratulations to Yiri, and .. "Long live the Gavial King!"

********The VOICE: Banking Guild News


The local bankers guild met recently to discuss rate increases and storage limits at an
undisclosed location and bankers from all over the Isle have been seen striding about
the city. Rumor has it that certain members of the Bankers Guild Council have been calling
for restrictions on depositors for some time, and finally their faction has been heard.
Expect your local moneylenders to restrict box-deposits and possibly even start charging fees
for their services in the near future. This move is seen as a stopgap measure in lieu of adding
increased storage and circumventing the added cost of vault construction, and many local
bankers will undoubtedly be pocketing the monies saved by such a decision.

Our readers are encouraged to act quickly before the new accounting procedures take place,
seeking auxiliary storage or moving their assets to multiple banks to help spread the load
and avoid the limits to be imposed. Local merchants have been appraised of the situation,
and many are crafting storage boxes and bins for use in private homes, though one wonders
if they will take advantage of the sudden demand and raise prices accordingly. More information
will be posted as soon as it becomes available.

The VOICE: Update

Due to increased pressure upon the editor and staff of The Voice,
we have had to temporarily relocate our offices, but should soon
be back in business. Our main scroll supplier has been caged outside of the City
by the Knight Marshal's office, and we are currently seeking means to effect his freedom.

Once we are back to printing, we will be bringing you up to date on all current affairs,
including the actions of the Emperor Yiri ( King of Goblins and King of Gavials,... holding
two such titles surely entitles one to use the moniker "Emperor"), as well as the often
whimsical actions of your local Conclave members.

Stay alert for the next free edition!

Schism in Aerthane's Temple!

A rift seems to have developed within the Temple of Aerthane, one of the most powerful Temples
on the isle, and word on the street is a Bolinau named Bihi is at the heart of it.

Aerthane's followers are divided on Bihi's proposal to open up their temple as sanctuary for the Goblins
of Three Bridges who are fleeing persecution from the King's Knights Marshal. The random lynching
and caging of goblins going on in retaliation for King Yiri's murderous rampages has got the Bolinau's
fur up, to say the least! Prelate Trystan Rivalen has been accused of foot-dragging on discussing the matter
in an open temple meeting, and his reticence hasn't helped. It should also be noted that many Bolinau
have been the victims of these attacks, including Bihi himself! One might wonder where Bihi could find
such compassion for the Goblin peoples, but in truth, the actions of one should not condemn the whole.

The King's missive of a little more than a year ago gives several of Archai's temples the right to grant
sanctuary " in good times and bad" , in the King's own words. Bihi contends, in a missive posted at his temple,
that the lynchings and cagings are going on without the King's knowledge. But where is our beloved Conclave
in all this? Why are they not bringing this matter up with His Majesty? Even the representatives of Temple Itzal remain
silent (theirs is not one of the sanctuary temples). Either they are afraid to confront the King about these injustices,
or realize Bihi is hopelessly naive when it comes to His Majesty's capacity for arbitrary wrath and vengeance.

Apparently this has all had an effect on the Knight Marshals. The retributions in Three Bridges seem to have
subsided somewhat, and no arrest warrant for Bihi has been issued, even though his temple posting strongly implies
that the Knight Marshals are acting in an extralegal fashion.

And how do the gods themselves view this turn of events? The possibility of Aerthane granting sanctuary to a group
of predominately Itzal's followers could shake up the heavens (or the underworld, as the case may be) and reports
of lightning strikes about Temple Aerthane could be comment enough.

Freedom for All seems to be the Bolinau's quest, but as yet we still have no word if the Goblins who were caged
were guilty of any crime, nor was there any official posting by the Knight Marshal's office about wanted persons
or questioning of citizens. Did the Goblins deserve their fate? ... or is Pearl striking back at the followers of King Yiri
simply because they cannot apprehend the infamous outlaw.

The question remains... is all this contention within Temple Aerthane the result of one rambunctious little Bolinau's
efforts for peace, or perhaps an infringement of the freedoms of the innocent ( the main tenant of the Aerthanian faith)
by an impotent and vengeful monarch?

voice be heard.

Missing Goblin Child!

A goblin child has gone missing in the vicinity of Three Bridges.
The father of most of the goblin children in Three Bridges, King Yiri, seems
to have misplaced one of his offspring. The missing child's name is Melvin,
however this may prove a bit confusing, as ALL of Yiri's kids are named Melvin.
When asked for a description of the missing younglin, Yiri had this to say...
"Meeza kidz izza pik iz noze alot, anz fart an sniffz imselvez".

Anyone with information on the missing youth is asked to contact Gelda of Gelda's Potion Shop
in Three Bridges, or the dockmaster of Three Bridges as soon as possible. Any notes concerning this
incident may also be left at the Burning Bandit posting board inside the inn.

Mysteries of Archai !

In a posting yesterday by the Knight Marshal's Scribe several prominent local
citizens of pearl were summoned to an audience with the King and his councilors.

The individuals summoned are some of Pearl's main movers and shakers, and include
Ivan Drovosik, recently returned from the Crowns and a former Architect for the King,
The Emissary Lord Ayderias Clarveu, a noted historian and eminent scholar,
the Merchant and Emissary Ernest Bouldermoore, a renowned Expedition leader for the
Land & Sea Property Exchange, and Knight Marshal Cascius Brierbrook .
Recent exploration of the northern part of the Isle has rediscovered the Silverford Mine,
and a journal, apparently written by old Silverford himself, seems to have awakened an
interest in many of the city's upper crust. With so much attention being paid to the writings
of the old miner one can only assume that the wealth and riches of the mine may well be
still intact, and the City's elite are positioning themselves swiftly to take advantage of the situation.

With the recent sightings of Wyvern in the city, and a new potion soon to be available that is said
to give the user a temporary ability to contact others mentally, (rumored to be made of Wyvern Blood)
it is quite possible that those delving into the Silverford mine have awakened a long-lost darkness,
and citizens are urged to be on their guard. It is quite possible that the King and other prominent
Pearleans will soon descend upon the area in numbers, staking claim to as much of the area's wealth
as they can, so grab your picks and shovels people! Make your way northward to the Silverford Mine and
do your getting while the getting is good! But beware, ....who knows what evils have been awakened and
sit in watch over what once may have been the home of Wyvern, Dragons, and all other manner of preternatural
creatures. Only perhaps Clyde knew...and he isn't telling. ....Or is he?

Lord Clarveu has promised to share his findings at the upcoming Alumni Day celebration held within the Academy,
and anyone with half a brain would do well to attend. It remains to be seen if the old scholar will succeed in deciphering
Cylde's journals, or if the King will even let his findings be made public. Only time will tell...

The VOICE: Conclave news!

The Conclave met on the twenty-sixth of this month in a closed door session in order to attempt to discuss
several proposals recently put forward during the open door meeting held earlier this month on the twelfth.
Noticeably missing from the proceedings were Emissaries Faran Fairuz-Taqqi, Emissary Nikolas Suyessod-Taqqi,
Emissary Visyn Eldur, and Emisssary Tian Tietjen. With both Emissaries from the Kaleithan Temple absent, one
must assume that they are not simply off on an all expense paid vacation or some type of lover's retreat. That
the Pyrousian Emissary disappeared around the same time may seem to some to be highly suspicious, and one
has to wonder ... Did the three aforementioned Conclave members go seeking the highly elusive Tietjan? Or
perhaps has some enterprising individual hired a local assassin in an attempt to create a new Conclave opening
for them self? If not, the profession of Conclave Member seems to be a risky one, and this paper would offer a
warning to the current council members.... Beware! A third of the Conclave members seem to have gone missing,
with no notices or explanations to their temples or the citizens they answer to. You might be next!

The remaining Emissaries seem to be taking up the slack, and votes were cast on several proposals, some of which
will affect Pearlean citizens directly. The first proposal addressed was one concerning the Conclave's responsibility
to voice the concerns of the citizens, and send a missive to the King about the treatment of the Goblin peoples by
over zealous Knight Marshals. In true political fashion, the members VETOED the proposal unanimously but for
Emissary Clarveu , who took the cautious path and abstained from voting. No word yet on how King Yiri is taking the news.

The next proposal was one concerning the detestable clamoring of the Dividicus Bell. All your Emissaries present voted
to remove, replace, or in some way stifle the damned thing, with the exception of Emissary O'Hara, who seems to enjoy
the hellacious cacophony it inflicts.

After this attention turned to the proposal requiring at least six Conclave members to vote on any Proposal that is sent
to the King. All present voted for this measure, though it would make more sense to require one vote from each Temple
Representative, and not just Any six votes.

The last item was the one that targeted Pearlean citizens themselves, and free speech it seems will be limited even further.
In a not so surprising move, all the Emissaries attending voted to allow only ONE proposal to be put forth per open door
session, per citizen. This move is seen by many as a way to shorten the already hugely inconvenient and hectic schedule of
the Conclave, which holds meetings one to two hours a day, two days a month. Gods forbid that this trend does not catch
on, and we end up with blacksmiths and store clerks entertaining these same hours!

In summation, Emissaries are missing, the Dividicus Bell will be fixed before it can be stolen or destroyed, the fate of
Goblins hanging in cages is not to be mentioned in polite company, only fifty percent of the Conclave need be present
to send a proposal to the King, ( and if two more members go missing, the remaining Emissaries have Carte Blanche),
and finally , don't bring more that one good idea per month to your government, their minds are too small to handle
any more than that!

the VOICE: Alumni Day Special Report

One of our reporters happened to be hanging around the local blacksmith shop when
a shipment came in from the docks today and noted a particular weapons case covered in
raven-black silk and guarded by several sailors. Upon further investigation, and at considerable risk,
our reporter was able to catch a glimpse of the weapon and overhear the conversation of the blacksmith
as he checked his newly arrived cargo. It seems the weapon in question is none other that the cutlass
that King Sauntere II presented to the Captain of the Fleet on the eve of the Midnight Masacre at the
Southern Outpost! Although the sword is not flashy and covered in gold, as most royal weapons are, it
is surely a weapon of great strength and craftsmanship. Our reporter was able to to confirm that the
weapon is indeed a smooth obsidian-inlaid swept-hilt Blacksteel Cutlass, which is likely the weapon that was
used on that ill-fated night, a truly Black on Black cutlass - black obsidian stones set into Blacksteel, and most likely
smoked with soot on the night in question to remove any trace of shine- and with the security and secrecy surrounding it,
will most likely be the item presented to one lucky individual at the Alumni Day festivities held on the eighth of Verdi.

Imagine owning a piece of history! Make sure and attend the Alumni day Festivities on the eighth of Verdi,
beginning at half past eight bells and featuring crafting demonstrations of Blacksmithing, Woodworking, and
Glassblowing among others. And to all who attend, we wish you Good Luck in the Raffle ! ( or auction or whathaveyou).

The VOICE: A Point of View Article-The Plight of the Goblins

Bihi the Cartographer's outspoken critiques of the Knight Marshals-- both in their inability to come to his aide during his confrontation with "King" Yiri, and in their subsequent collective punishment of the Goblins of Three Bridges as retribution for "King" Yiri's rampages-- seems to have gone without response. The Knight Marshals have not arrested Bihi, or even threatened to do so. Nor have they gone on a rampage of hanging or caging random Bonilau. Even our beloved Conclave must have been aware of this.

Thus the Conclave's practically unanimous vote to ignore the plight of the Goblins of Three Bridges seems not to be motivated by any fear of retribution from the Marshals, but rather their own sincere distaste for Goblin rights within the Realm. Even Itzal's representatives-- the dominate religion of the Goblins-- voted against raising concerns about Goblin abuses with the King. The action of the Conclave raises an important question: does it actually represent all the King's subjects? Is it functioning as intended? Or is it intended that goblins be without any voice within the Realm beyond a mere Bonilau scribbler and an insane, murderous pretender? How would such a situation impact the peace and good order of the Island?

Will the Conclave's open prejudice be good for the Peace of the Realm in the long run? And more importantly to some, will it be good for business? How might an open rebellion in Three Bridges impact commerce--- not only with the Goblins there-- but with Outlast or Rum Village, or access to the resources of the Ravenswood?

How much profit is the ATC willing to lose just to indulge Conclave's petty bigotries?

The VOICE: a Point of View- New Realities

The recent heated debate over the plight of the goblins of Three Bridges-- as exposed in the pages of the VOICE of Pearl-- exposes new realities in our culture. Even if Yiri is a follower of Itzal, the Knight Marshals did not lash out at other followers of Itzal when they became frustrated with their inability to cope with Yiri's rampages. They lashed out at goblins. And when their lashing out was brought before the Conclave, even the "representatives" if Itzal felt no obligation to speak up for their goblin Temple mates-- simply because they were goblins.

We are no longer a community which finds its principle fault-lines along our different religions, but along new fault-lines: fault-lines of race.

If His Majesty desires an advisory body that gives a voice to all his varied subjects, it has become obvious he can no longer trust a Conclave constituted on the basis of religions to provide this. The new reality demands he dissolve this now archaic, dysfunctional Conclave and institute a new advisory body: one constituted with race representation as the primary factor.

The VOICE: Fisherman saved by Bolinau!

Witnesses have reported that a local fisherman was saved from a pickpocket today at the Academy docks
by a courageous Bolinau. An Old Fisherman was being repeatedly pestered by a pick-pocket goblin
when a local Bolinau came across the scene, and repeatedly asked the goblin to cease his illegal activity.
The would-be pickpocket made no response, continuing to attempt to steal from the old angler dozens of times,
jumping onto the dock, attempting to pickpocket him, and then running back to the road.
The Bolinau, one Bihi by name, called for assistance and when none arrived drew his bow and attempted to protect the angler.
The thief attacked Bihi viciously and with skill, calling him a 'dirty fisherman' and other such epitaphs.
The brave Bolinau stood his ground however, and even though outmatched protected the beloved fishing instructor to the bitter end.

In an apparent gesture to the Aerthane community, the Goddess Aerthane immediately resurrected Bihi
despite (or in support of?) his very public repudiation of the Temple Community for their racism. One can only wonder.
Kudos to the Bolinau, and all the brave people out there that stand up for those weaker than themselves!

A collection is being taken up for the old fisherman to help replace the twenty three doubloons that were stolen by the thief.
Donations can be left at the Burning Bandit in care of this paper.

 The VOICE: POV-The Failure of Conclave

Another Point of View article submitted by our readers.

* The views and opinions expressed in this article are strictly those of it's author.
* The VOICE assumes no responsibility legally or otherwise for any content herein.

___________________________________________________________________


Conclave's incessant foot-dragging and excuse-making when it comes the plight of the goblins, as exposed
to our readers by Bihi the Cartographer, exposes its own disqualification as community leaders. Set aside--
as difficult as this may be-- the moral and racist implications of punishing random people for the crimes of other--
just because they share the same race-- and consider for a moment the practical implications of such a policy.
First, can it be expected to have any impact on the criminal who's crimes continue to go unpunished?
The racist claims that all goblins are selfish, petty, amoral creatures-- little more than animals-- contradicts this very expectation.
If Yiri-- because he is a goblin-- cares only about himself, why should attacking other goblins in another city
effect his behavior? Inevitably the "logic" of racism turns against its proponents, and we can see it is actually
Conclave who are being selfish, petty, and amoral with their current policies. They have become the 'goblins' that
they rail against: ignoring the sufferings of another community because of their own selfishness and hatred,
not to better our society. Conclave has become indistinguishable from "King Yiri."

And what is the effect of such policies on other goblins? If they are subject to random lynchings and cagings,
in essence "damned if they do (commit crimes) and damned if they don't," Conclave makes a life of crime the only
reasonable option for all goblins to pursue: in essence they conveniently give all goblins no real choice but to behave
in ways that fit Conclave's stereotypes for them. When the marshals and Conclave take away the rule of law from a
whole race, and give them no other realistic option beyond anti-social behavior, how is the greater community helped?
Conclave's bigotry makes our entire community less safe. And that is another error all bigots seem to make: when they
viciously mistreat the target of their bigotry, they end up hurting us all-- including themselves.

The VOICE: Current Affairs

The Academy hosted Alumni Day yesterday and the Prelate Trystan Rivalen spared no expense
catering the event, hiring Chef Seren Brin to delight all with her culinary expertise. The day started off
with a fishing tournament hosted by former outlaw Xiija Anzu, and anglers from all over the isle brought
their best poles and lures to the Academy docks in an effort to claim the title of Master Angler, which it is
reported was won by Flynt of the Sylvan peoples. The festivities were held shortly afterwards and included
numerous demonstrations of craftsmanship - Blacksmithing by the Empyrion Bocon Lampor, Woodcarving by the
Ra'Daji Garavan Azahar, and Glasssblowing by his wife Emissary Rochiriel Azahar. The evening ended with
Lord Ayderias Clarveu speaking about his findings and research on Clyde Silverford and the history of the Gnomes.

The highlight of the event was the secret raffle of the weapon created by the merchant Menfanous Hammersmith.
This weapon, an obsidian-trimmed basket-hilted blacksteel cutlass, is the spitting image of the cursed blade that
was used at the massacre on the southern outpost and Hammersmith has done an amazing job of recreating in
every detail the likeness of that ill-fated weapon. It seems that his efforts were not in vain, for as soon as it was
won by Kaiya (an Aerthanian, last name unknown), the Ra'Daji and his wife immediately pounced on her, offering
a reported 100,000 gold doubloons for the amazing replica! Seeing as they could have gotten the weapon at a tenth
of that price, it appears that the Tetharians were adamant on owning the thing, and one must speculate on why
Tetharian Temple leaders would be seeking so desperately a replica of a blade that killed so many of their followers.
Apparently the Azahars, being unable to own the original, settled for paying an outlandish fee to own the next best thing!
There is no word yet on how the rest of the temple is taking the news, but the VOICE will try and keep you informed.

Local Goblins seemed to have boycotted the event, and continue to amass great numbers in the Three Bridges area,
perhaps due to the efforts of Goblin activist Bihi the Bolinau Cartographer, who will most likely speak at tonight's
open door Conclave meeting.

 The VOICE: Ras'na Thule the Unholy



The following story is based on some facts, but steeped in legend and myth garnerd from
various cultures all over the known world and compiled from many sources, valid or not-
....beleive what you will.

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Ras'na Thule was born in the city of Ra'Dun to the Verdani arcanist Rhialdor Thule and his wife, the Human diviner
Nefhrin Releven. The name Ras'na means "wisdom of vision" in the Verdani tongue, and from a young age the half-elven
child showed signs of becoming a great scholar. Because of the stigma of having birthed a child of mixed race his parents
were shunned by the Verdani of Tetheras and forced to leave the city of Ra'Dun, beginning a lifetime of travel and adventure for the
young boy. His early life was steeped in scholastic study, predominantly the arts of the Arcanist taught by his father, and the
ways of the Diviner which his mother shared with him, along with intense study in the area of magic with mages of his father's faith
and the water mages of his mothers people. Having learned all that he could from his parents and being a child of two religions,
Ras'na chose to eschew any one religion and soon began studies with the mages of Pyrous and Aerthane and quickly became one of the
brightest and most well respected scholars of his time. He studied in all the major cities of the day including Aeran,
Dahkma Bay and Pyrdian. He finally settled in the city of Valar and became one of the foremost mages in the lands.

It was during this time that Gharviskal the White, most renowned of Dragons, fell into darkness from the loss of his mate and his body
crashed down through the city into catacombs beneath Valar, giving birth to the Wyvern race and what many beleive to be a pivotal moment
in history by letting loose the potential of the Great Shattering. Ras'na was brought in by the Council of Mages to study the remains for
their magical properties and the effects, if any, upon the current elemental magic systems in use at that time.
Little did anyone know that another mage was conducting experiments of his own on a new type of magic.

When Itzal first began his experiments with Shadow Magic he consulted with Ras'na, learning many things about the element of Air that he would
soon combine with fire to create his own brand of magic. Their collaborations gave Ras'na many insights into Itzal's work, and when he learned that
Astraeva was seeking a counter to these dark spells, he worked with her to teach her the element of Earth and further her research on the properties
of Light Magic. Thus did Ras'na gain the trust of both and aquired knowledge of the spells of these two new disciplines, and when the Great Shattering
occurred Ras'na helped to re-establish the Academies and centers for learning among the various religions, old and new, on all the newly formed islands.

Having studied all over the world with mages of every religion and speaking to many dragons, even beng taught however briefly by
Gharviskal himself, Ras'na was called upon to found an Academy to teach mages about Dragons and soon became the first 'Horde Mage' in charge
of helping the newly powerless Dragons to regain their former magic. Ras'na excelled at his calling but was ever seeking new wisdom and new magics
and when the existence of the Wyvern races was revealed, he sought the source of their transformation and soon learned that the blood of Dragons
was at the heart of it. Having access to the Dragons, Ras'na began to take samples of thier blood and feed it to the Wyverns in hopes of learning
a way to tame the awesome potential of the creatures, delving deeper and deeper into an area of heretofore unexplored science.
He discovered that when a mage ingests the poison not only do they receive the ability to hear the thoughts of others, but also that their own magic
becomes inert and a barrier surrounds them, nullifying the magic of any others for a short time.

When the Council of Mages found out about Ras'na's research they expelled him from their Council and stripped him of his honors and his position as
Horde Mage, driving him from their lands and banishing him to the Ban'Ghard forest. Ras'na was undaunted, swiftly seeking passage upon a ship leaving
the newly formed isle of New Archai and embarking on a journey to all the sundered parts of the old land, which had become islands in their own right.
His journeys led him farther and farther from civilization, and he eagerly sought out all the oldest ways, learning magics that were known before the
worship of the elements, the arts of vodun, witchcrafts and shamanic traditions almost lost to time. It was upon these voyages that the disgraced
scholar learned how to reanimate the dead, creating zombies and other such minions, and the art of releasing the soul from a body and capturing the spirit.
These practices seem to have had an effect upon Ras'na, for when he returned to the isle of New Archai aboard a pirate ship, he at once secluded himself
away in the Ban'Ghard forest, shunning the company of the living and creating undead servants to assist him with his dark powers. He used his newly
aquired knowledge to prolong his life, some say even becoming an undying spirit encased in a body of flesh much like his creations.

Years later when the battle between the Tetharians and King Sauntere II happened at the Southern Outpost, Ras'na saw his chance for revenge against those
who had banised him and offered his services to the Knight Marshal who was assigned as Captain of the Royal Fleet, cursing his Black Blade with eldritch spells
of doom and destruction. When the Tetharians arrived and laid waste to the entire contingent of King Sauntere II's army, he sought out the Verdani leaders
and showed them the spells by which the prisoners were cursed with eternal life, forever bound to the scorched stone walls that line the outpost.
Their soulless bodies still wander the grounds at night, vampiric beings whose sole purpose is to suck the essence of life from the living.
Having wrought havoc upon all involved, Ras'na laid one final spell upon the lands - a plague that ravaged the entire island and was held in check
only by the combined might of the mages and healers of the King.

The plague of New Archai still exists today, and only slowly are the lands being freed from the curse of Ras'na the Unholy, who still resides deep within
the Ban'Ghard forest with his undead servants, and the effects of his spells can still be seen in any graveyard you may pass, as wandering skeletons
and spirits infest the lands and vampiric beings continue to roam the Southern Outpost. It is even rumored that the wraith of the doomed Captain of the Fleet
can still be found in the place that Ras'na enprisoned him, the old watchtower in Stirling Forest. So if you are traveling through the isle of New Archai
and happen to hear tales of Ras'na the Unholy, Necromancer of the Ban'Ghard forest, do not discount them - for not all that dies is truly dead.

The VOICE: Festival Peddle News

The Verdani Merchant Lephierna held a peddle last night at the palace gazebo and citizens
from all over the island came to try their luck at winning an auction for some remarkable items.
A reporter of the VOICE attended, and was able to catalog the items, prices, and winners of
the bids, some of which were outlandish in the extreme.

The Harvest Festival Peddle items and their winners and costs are as follows:

__________________________________________________________

 a wide-limbed polished teak short-bow &an extra-large quiver of steel broadhead yew arrows
was won by Kaiya the Avardi for 3200 doubloons.

 a leather-padded green dragon-etched thoraxium arm guard was won by Garaven the Verdani for 4500 doubloons.

 a smooth mahogany-handled upswept palm blacksteel skinner was won by Garaven the Verdani for 12,000 doubloons.

 a bronze-buckled stretched elk hide satchel was won by Trystan the Humani for 500 doubloons.

 a teak-hilted serrated back-edged crudesteel machete was won by Nykliox the Gargoyle for 700 doubloons.
( an apparent goblin prejudice was in effect as Crudesteel is a Goblin-made metal, and stronger than steel)

 a steel-riveted hardened leather bow sling was won by Kaiya the Avardi for 2500 doubloons.

 a teak-handled vine-engraved electrum forest axe was won by Geel the Gavial for 30,000 doubloons.

 a green chitin-shielded warthog hide back scabbard was won by Nykliox the Gargoyle for 100 doubloons.

 an extra-large quiver of steel bodkin head cedar arrows was won by Geel the Gavial for 10,000 doubloons.

 a ivory-gripped wolf-enscupted redwood recurve bow & an extra-large quiver of steel-barbed osage arrows
was won by Kaiya the Avardi for 30,000 doubloons.

 an extra-large quiver of steel-tipped hickory darts & an ornately-carved eagle feather-adorned teak blowgun
was won by Seren the Avardi for 6000 doubloons.
__________________________________________________________________________________

It is possible that some members of the audience were "shills" for Merchant Lephierna, bumping up the
prices of the bids to fatten the merchants pockets. This strategy didn't seem to work on all the items
offered as some were sold at ridiculously low prices, however this lack was made up by outlandish bids for
not so special items made by certain citizens perhaps not so intelligent or cosmopolitan as their peers.

The evening's smartest bidder?..Nykliox, who walked away with a Crudesteel weapon and a chitin shielded
scabbard for a total of 800 doubloons. Well done! The peddles most gullible participant?.. Geel, who got an
Electrum axe and a quiver of arrows to the tune of 40.000 doubloons! Most of the other bidders made savvy
bids and seemed to have current figures and prices in their heads before attending the event.
Kudos to Merchant Lephierna on a job well done!

Crates of harvest foods were also produced, and many spent a little coin to procure the fresh produce offered,
which is still available at the encampment on Thalassa road, as well as the festival activities of archery and the
corn maze. No word yet on the missing satchels that were meant to be prizes for those who finished the maze.

 The VOICE: ATC Mischeif

The ATC seems to be working in conjunction with an unknown faction to keep the Dividicus Bell from
being removed, contrary to the vote of the Conclave and the popular opinion of pearl's citizens. By asking
Menfanous Hammersmith to obtain the necessary materials to make a new bell, the Conclave has put the future
of the City Bell directly into his hands. Hammersmith has asked for Ten Thousand pounds of metal to be
DONATED ( not sold) to the ATC - a task which will surely keep local miners in the mines for years to come.
One might question... if the new bell is to be smaller, why can't the ATC and Hammersmith melt down the old
one and use that material, and still have some left over? Most likely the counter argument will be that the
Dividicus bell will be brought down and housed in a museum, and that if the citizens really want it replaced,
they can pay the cost themselves. Since Emissary O'Hara was the only one to vote against a new bell, and Hammersmith
seems intent on making it impossible to collect the materials, it would seem that Temple Astraeva has aligned with
the King to keep the old bell ringing forever. At five thousand pounds, the new bell will need a small army to raise
it to the bell tower roof, and at over three tons, the old bell will be nigh impossible to remove and cart to it's new home.

There have been reports that the new bell will be considerably less than five thousand pounds, and that the ATC and
Hammersmith, (and possibly Temple Astraeva and the Crown) will split the profits from the sale or use of the left-over
materials. The main message here seems to be - be careful what you ask for, or... don't trust the ATC!
In either case donations are currently being accepted, and all suckers (citizens) are asked to contribute what they can.

The VOICE: Weapon Peddle

The Merchant Menfanous Hammersmith held a peddle last week, and despite the lack of
advertising or announcements the event still drew a modest crowd of locals seeking to
add to their collections of hand-held death. The Merchant seemed to be at a loss as to why
some of his fine items garnered so little attention, but as always, he came out ahead when
the rare Blacksteel and Electrum weapons were put on the auction block.

The following is a list of the items offered, along with the bid winners, and what they paid:

____________________________________________________________________________

 a niello-handled steel spiked mace was sold to the Verdani Rochiriel for 400 doubloons.
 a leather-wrapped orichalcum cudgel was sold to the Sylvan Flynt for 500 doubloons.
 a basket-hilted serrated orichalcum rapier was sold to the Human Zoe for 500 doubloons.
 a two-handed acid-etched mahogany handled steel maul was sold to the Verdani Rochiriel for 500 doubloons.

 a troll-bone handled crudesteel sickle was sold to the Vukasin Leto for 2100 doubloons.

an intricately-carved ebony-handled mahogany walking stick
holding an ebony handled electrum bodkin was sold to the Verdani Rochiriel for 15,000 doubloons.


 a two-handed osage pole-mounted blacksteel sovnya was sold to the Gavial Geel for 51,000 doubloons.


 a polished hickory back-sheath holding a hickory and blacksteel-handled electrum scimitar
was sold to the Gavial Geel for 180,000 doubloons.

______________________________________________________________________________

It must have been embarrassing for the merchant to sell hand-crafted steel, crudesteel and orichalcum weapons
for such mind bogglingly low prices, but the almost impossible to get Blacksteel and Electrum items as always
brought the big money, and Merchant Hammersmith's pockets are in no danger of coming up empty for quite some time.

Purchases of Note:
The Electrum Bodkin bought by Rochiriel which is purported to be stronger than Blacksteel.
The Blacksteel Sovnya and two-handed Electrum Scimitar bought by Geel , possibly the deadliest weapons on the Island.

With the amount of coin that certain citizens spend, it is possible that one or more of the night's participants are
engaged in illegal activities that increase one's bank balance enormously, and any person with information about such
things is urged to contact the Editor of this paper with all possible speed. All informants identities will remain strictly anonymous.

The VOICE: Peddler in town Tonight!

The Arkwright Elmere Manske will be in town tonight to hold a Shrouded & Cloaked Peddle at half past eight bells.
Since Manske usually deals in containers and such, it is unclear exactly what will be for sale, but one can guess...
Shrouded and cloaked boxes?..... Cloaks with hidden pockets?....perhaps even Cloaks shrouded in mystery?
Anything is possible, and the only way to find out is to Attend! The merchant is well known for his style and quality
of craftsmanship, and after watching the last peddle where Merchant Menfanous sold good quality steel and
orichalcum items for next to nothing, it is entirely possible to come away from this nights peddle with some
truly amazing items at a decent price.

So come out tonight and help support local merchants, even if you can't afford anything you can still sit and gossip
about those who aren't there! Come see what all the mystery is about!

The VOICE: Longest Night Celebration

The Longest Night will be celebrated this evening throughout the Isle, and local law enforcement is hoping
that it will not be a repeat of the chaos seen during the celebrations of previous years. Local merchant Ernest
Bouldermoore will be holding a Mask-themed event this evening starting at nine bells, but no word yet on if citizens
should show up in costumes, wearing masks, or even if there will be food and drink available to the participants.

The Longest Night has often been a time of unrest and rebellion for many of those upon the isle, and the time between
Longest Night and the last night of the month of Shade, sometimes called Devil's Night, looks to be fraught with hijinx
and merriment, parties and civil disobedience. There has been no official word issued by the Knight Marshal's office yet, but
citizens should be aware that in past years the end of Shade has seen Pearl under heavy guard, and often left in a shambles
as the first days of Zephyrous descend upon the city. Citizens are urged to use caution when venturing forth during the next
few days, and to travel in groups when ever possible.

and now a few words about this Solstice Event...

______________The Solstice Celebration__________________

The Longest night is celebrated by many cultures and religions,
and in many various ways. To many tribal peoples, the Solstice
can have a great significance, and play an important part in their
belief systems. To those of a more arcane or magical nature, the
use of sacrificial animals can sometimes lend power to the spells
that are conjured during this time. For those who follow the path of
Shadow, the festival known as Saw'Hain is traditionally celebrated
on this night, and is considered by some as a time to celebrate the lives of
those who have passed on, and it often involves paying respect to ancestors,
family members, elders of the faith, friends, pets, and other loved ones
who have died. In some rituals the spirits of the departed are invited to
attend the festivities. It is seen as a festival of darkness, and the use of costumes
ensures that the envious spirits will not cause Harm to those who appear as they do.....

The staff of the VOICE of Pearl wishes you a safe and dreadful evening, and reminds you ....
Don't trod upon other people's beliefs.... lest their beliefs trod upon YOU!

The VOICE: Longest Night Update

The celebration of the Longest Night has swept through Pearl once again, and true to form it left
chaos and mystery in it's wake. The night's mayhem started with several bodies of local merchants being found
throughout the city, and as Knight Marshals began their questionings and their search for the person or persons
responsible the Goblin King Yiri , along with several of his followers launched attacks upon innocent citizens around
the area of the town square. The Marshals were quick to respond, and with the guidance of Knight Marshals Matilda
and Ochir, the local constables were able to trap and bind the Goblin King. Yiri called for his followers to rise up and free him,
and they even seemed to succeed temporarily, as he broke out of his bonds and attacked again before finally being subdued and
taken to the local prison. After things had quieted down a bit local merchant Ernest Bouldermore arrived and proceeded
to enlist the help of those still alive in a scavenger hunt type of event which entailed the finding of exquisitely crafted
masks that were "lost" by Bouldermoore throughout the city.

After the Mask event was concluded several local citizens complained of headaches and voices filling their minds, and it is
believed that Wyvern activity in the region was responsible for it all. It may be of note that most such mental invasions
were previously confined to assaults upon mages, but this latest wave seemed to affect mage and commoner alike.
The message from the creatures seemed unclear, but the results of such a widespread sending seems to have woken
a Dragon! A large mature, possibly Black, Dragon was seen attacking the city from the east wall and then making it's way
to the Palace, where it spewed flame and destruction for several minutes before flying off over the bay.
Local masons and the Land & Sea Property Exchange will most likely be touring the city today to assess the damage and
begin repairs.

The next few days leading up to the last day of Shade, often called "Devil's Night" could be fraught with danger and
rebellion. The Goblin King's followers are sure to be out in force, and Temple Itzal will likely take this most dark and holy of
times (this is a sacred week for them) and use the ensuing chaos to their advantage. Citizens are warned to go about armed and armored,
and to travel in groups when ever possible. (If you are a member of Temple Itzal, ... just go out and have you some fun!)

The VOICE: The Execution of Emperor Yiri !


Tonight at nine bells, the Monarch of Pearl will attempt to execute the Emperor Yiri the Goblin for
crimes committed within the City of Pearl and its surrounding tributary towns and villages. The King of
the Goblins, and reputed King of the Gavials has been pursuing his agenda of freeing the Goblin peoples
from the oppression of the Knight Marshals and their King, Sauntere the Eighth. It is rumored that Yiri is
descended from one of the twelve tribal leaders that swore their oaths to Itzal himself, and as such, may have
a rightful claim to the GoblinCrown . If this is true, the Ruler of these lands risks open war with ALL the Goblin
tribes by executing their true and rightful leader. It is NO surprise that these actions take place at a time when the
Pearlean Conclave is on hiatus, and any legal support or advice normally given to any accused persons is all but nonexistent.

Citizens would do well to begin stockpiling arms and armor, as well as foodstuffs and any other items they may need, as the
actions taken by Sauntere and his Marshals may lead to widespread panic and warfare, thus affecting local merchants and
markets throughout the isles. It is also rumored that the Goblins may seek the help or aid of the Gnomish peoples, who have had
a long standing feud with the Monarchy of Pearl, and if such a union manifests the City of Pearl could face attacks from multiple fronts.

To the Goblin peoples we say... Rise UP!
Now is the time for all great Goblins to come to the aid of their King!

The VOICE: Execution News


The Goblin King Yiri was executed by hanging last night by Marshals of King Sauntere VIII, along with two
other criminals - one reportedly in the employ of a Bolinau Knight Marshal. The execution was attended by
several local citizens, among them family and friends of Bolinau victims of the recent attacks. Supporters of
King Yiri also attended, and several were seen throwing objects at the Knight Marshals and Executioner, some
of which were set on fire, supposedly in an attempt to burn down the gallows. One of the objects was reportedly an
explosive device which detonated in their midst, injuring several of the King's officers.

Unbelievably, no serious injuries were received and the execution went on as planned, with the Goblin King uttering his last words
directly to the Knight Marshal Matilda and the Royal Executioner, supposedly offering them the chance to place their
lips affectionately upon his protruding buttocks! Marshal Matilda was seriously maimed by the Goblin King, apparently
losing a finger while wrestling the condemned to the gallows, but seems to have gotten her revenge by kicking Yiri's teeth in.

The Marshals indicated that because of sedition within their ranks, the attacks on Three Bridges were unsanctioned, and that all
attacks by the peoples of that town against Pearl will be forgiven, and no further charges will be filed. It remains to be seen
if there will be any repercussions from the execution of the leader of the Goblin peoples.

of Note: All three criminals went out fighting, and were pronounced dead at the scene. The Gods or Goddesses of each may or may not
choose to offer them resurrection, but if so, it is assumed that these individuals will have paid for their crimes, and be free of
persecution until such time as further charges are brought against them.

The VOICE: Expedition, New Bell, and a Crafters Exchange

Citizens of Pearl will set forth on an expedition into the crowns tonight in an effort to gain more
information on the supposed Wyvern attacks that have been plaguing the city for months. Interested
adventurers should meet at the Burning Bandit at Nine bells to compare notes and gird themselves for
the trip, which should be quite an adventure. The Crowns are rich in resources, so bring shovels, picks, rope
and possibly some potions against disease, as this area has only recently been cleared of infection. The King
has refused to send any aid to the expedition, which may likely pass close to the Gnomish village to the north,
but has offered seats at a private dinner next month to any who survive the ordeal. Most likely the dinner will be used
to garner any information on the riches to be found in the crowns which may be of interest to His Royal Majesty, as well
as details on possible attacks by Dragons or Wyverns from that area. The VOICE wishes the best of luck to any and all
brave souls who venture forth this evening!

In other news....

The Dividicus Bell has been supplemented by a smaller bell, the Light Bell, (in honor of the efforts of Temple Astraeva)
which will ring out the hours only within the City. The Dividicus Bell will ring out only the top of each hour, and citizens
from all over the island have expressed joy at the news! After months of complaints and political maneuvering it seems the Voice
of the people has been heard. On a side note, the price of cotton has dropped slightly as a result of this event, most likely due
to the fact that earplugs will no longer be in such high demand.



Crafter's Exchange

Local Bolinau Merchant Charlat Reycroft will be holding a Crafter's Exchange in three days time, at nine bells in the evening.
This event seems geared towards helping Merchant Reycroft help You, and methods and materials will be discussed
and debated during the event, and possibly Reycroft may even be teaching local crafters how to make some new items !
The Voice advises those who are planning on attending to bring plenty of raw materials, and to practice their crafts as
much as possible in the days leading up to the event.



In the comming weeks...

Merchant Brooke Willowby will be taking Custom Food Orders on the fifteenth of the month at nine bells in the evening,
most likely at the Pearlean Pavillion. Make sure to attend this event as Willowby is a well known local Chef and highly skilled
in the culinary arts.

Merchant Menfanous Hammersmith will be holding another Weapons peddle on the twentieth of the month, also at nine bells,
and again most likely at the Pearlean Pavillion. His last peddle saw steel and orichalcum items go for unheard of prices, well
under current market value, as low as four to five hundred doubloons, so Make Sure and attend this Peddle people!

: The VOICE: Hobgoblins, Thalassa Road and more !

An encampment of Hobgoblins has been found south of Three Bridges and southeast of the city of Pearl. The Hobgoblins must have been
working in secret to have set up such an extensive camp without the knowledge of it's existence leaking out somehow. Perhaps the reason
the Hobgoblins were able to build up their camp so quickly was due to the fact that Goblin slaves were used in the construction. Several
Goblin prisoners have been liberated from their enslavement by local adventurers, and Three Bridges has posted guards at the southern gate.
Rumors of hangings, torture, crudesteel smithing (formerly a Goblin secret), and mines containing salt and precious ores have been the talk
of the local Three Bridges tavern for many weeks now. Anyone venturing into the area would do well to travel in large groups, or hire large
body guards or mercenaries to accompany them. No word yet on what steps Goblin King Yiri is taking to safeguard his people.

The road northwest from Pearl to Rum Village has been opened recently due to pirate attacks on the Three Bridges ferry and other such
inconveniences, and many travelers have been seen making their way down Thalassa Road, which skirts the edge of the Ban'Ghard forest.
The King has posted guards along paths still not cleared of the plague, and besides a few small outbreaks within the city, the way seems safe
to use and plague free. Of note in Rum Village: a large Kaleithian warship, possibly a pirate vessel, has been grounded at the port. Local
home builders might be wise to snatch up or saw off parts of the ship, as it seems it will not return to the sea again.

The VOICE: Ban'Ghard News

The Ban'Ghard forest has been recently cleared of plague, and has been nothing but a death trap ever since.
First, tigers are reported to have killed half a dozen people, including Royal Guardsmen, and not long after that
the mysterious arch located in the southwestern part of the forest was somehow unlocked or unspell'd, and numerous
Wendigo looking creatures have been released from behind it and are currently running rampant all over the area.
The forest itself is rich in resources, and many adventurers can be found gathering and chopping all day long, but with
the recent Undead attacks, it is most likely that a priest of Tetherias will be needed to seal the arch, or at least create
a barrier that will keep the undead from despoiling the rest of the forest.

Adventurers be warned, and keep vials of several potions with you at all times when visiting this area.

The VOICE: Armor, Taxes, and Mayhem!

Armor News-

Vogrok Silverforge will be returning tomorrow to deliver the orders that were taken a few
weeks ago, and customers are advised to show up early to avoid the soul crushing wait
times that usually accompany such events. Arcsilver armor seems to be the latest craze,
and local miners have been hard put to keep up with the demands for the metal used by
the smith.


Conclave Update-

In true political form the Conclave passed a proposal that shortens their workload even
further, down to only One day a month. With the last proposal limiting citizens to bringing
only One proposal per session, it seems that the local government is doing all in it's
limited power to try and banish itself out of existence! The next expected proposal is
that they be paid well for doing .... nothing, which seems to be the main goal of most
of the proposals of late. In related news, taxes are now being collected from all city hunts,
and local hunt leader Blink Walkabout has moved the venue of his hunts from the Burning
Bandit to the city square of Pearl, most likely as to take advantage of the opportunity to
increase the already deep pockets of local government officials.

Local News-

Tensions are running high between Temple Pyrous and Temple Aerthane, and because of
a few bad eggs it looks like there is a possibility of War between the two temples. No word
yet on how the Prelate and the Empyrion are reacting to the matters at hand, but Temple
Pyrous may need a few allies to take on the largest Temple on the isle.

Numerous people have reportedly been attacked by an unknown assassin, who apparently
strikes at random from the shadows, and uses poisoned weapons to incapacitate the
victims. It is possible that the attacks are just a cover for a single target, and the many
innocent others are being used to throw suspicion off of the intent of the attacks. Citizens
are warned to be on the look-out , and report any suspicious activities to the local guard
captain or Knight Marshals.

Rumors of a Dragon landing in the city have been circulating, though no one as yet can
confirm the identity or even the color of said beast. Anyone with information on these
events is urged to contact the VOICE, and as usual, all contributors will remain confidential .

The VOICE: Latest News

Merchants & Conclave:

Tharansis Joltharsson has applied for the vacant Kaleithian seat on Conclave, and along with his current
(hunting partner/love interest?) should soon be a regular representative in the Conclave chambers for the Sea God's temple.

Several Locals seem to have been bitten by the merchant bug, and applications to the ATC are at an all time high.
Kschilan Tehekchen has been accepted by the ATC as a carpenter/woodworker and will be inducted into the ranks
of merchant society as soon as she bends over and pays the 50,000 doubloon fee. Most likely there will be arcane
rituals involved for each new induction to this secretive society, and rumor has it that a blindfold, paddle, and blood
are involved. Congratulations to Kschilan !... her patron, Elmere Manske must surely be pleased with his pupil.

Other recent applications include - Bocon Lampor , Empyrion of Pyrous, who will be a metalsmith under the tutelage
of his patron MasterSmith Vogrok Silverforge, and Ayanna Rimehart, a seamstress in training who will learn the ins and outs
of fleecing the flock from her patron , Land & Sea Co. representative Ivan Drovosik. Best of luck to them both!



Local Scavenger Hunt

Baelric Makennin held a scavenger hunt type event recently, based in the city's main town square and covering
both New Archai and it's surrounding isles. Since this individual does not seem to be an authorized ATC
representative it came as no surprise when said Sylph absconded with all hunt items and offered no rewards
for the hunt. Wise locals gathered more than the minimum amount of each sought after item, and some rare
things may still be gotten... for a price. It should be interesting to see if Baelric will see any reprisals from the ATC.

Sources have also reported that while insulting Itzalites, Baelric stole a satchel that had been given to an Argali in
front of witnesses. One witness was heard to have said later: "Baelric mocks Itzalites, then imitates them?"
Of course Itzalites are not ALL thieves, and this paper does not condone any racial profiling, but merely reports events
and eye witness quotes as they are given to us. Regardless, it is rumored that a price has been set upon the Sylph's head
for his recent actions and anyone with information might find willing ears at the Royal Tankard in Pearl.


Weekly Academy Hunts

Hierophant Kaiah of Itzal has recently started leading weekly hunts for students of the Academy, much like
those held in the city of Pearl. The one main difference is, there are NO taxes being donated to the city from
the proceeds of these hunts. Interested students should head to the Academy square at eight bells on the fourth
day of the week. Kudos to Temple Itzal for their community service and willingness to help new students!

The VOICE: Out with the old, In with the new


The year 438 was a strange one for many, but filled with surprises and events that will not
soon be forgotten. Before we step into the arms of 439, lets take a look back...

Several areas previously closed due to the plague were re-opened or rediscovered , including
the Ban'Ghard forest (and a mysterious arch contained therein), as well as the old Thalassa
roadway being cleared, with Tigers reportedly being seen in the area. The road was cleared all the way
to Rum Village, where a pirate ship limped in and can be seen shipwrecked upon the docks there.
The road from Rum Village to the Bison Plains was cleared, and the way cleared in the other direction
all the way back to Pearl, where road repairs were made by merchants and local citizens.

Outside of the township of Three Bridges a Hobgoblin encampment was found, and many goblin
slaves were freed there by the efforts of goblins from that area as well as citizens of Pearl.
The city of Pearl itself saw many interesting events, such as Trolls and other creatures raining down
from the skies, the Museum and Bath-house openings, and many social and political events that
bear mentioning. The Conclave cast many votes, most of which either limited the proposals they
would have to hear, or limited the hours and times that Conclave itself would have to function.
New Conclave members were sworn in, (some old ones seem to have left or been assassinated)
and new Merchant apprentices have been accepted by the ATC. A city bank account was established,
and hunts lead by Blink Walkabout were transferred to Pearl from their previous home at the
Burning Bandit, which saw the closure of the local custom of Drink Night. Also, weekly hunts
at the Academy were started by Kaiah of Temple Itzal.

As for the social scene, the Longest Night was quiet this year, and the Celebration of the Great Eye
seems to have been forgotten by all but a few, and no executions were made all year by the Knight
Marshals.

The coming year will see the Conclave returning from it's recess and raising it's sleepy head like
a bear emerging from hibernation during the first week of Eurous. The current calendar is as follows:

_________________________________________________________
8th - Conclave Council, Closed Door Vote, 8 1/2 bells
8th - Conclave Council, Public Meeting, 9 bells
10th - Housing Representative, Ivan Drovosik, 8 bells
22nd - Winter Ball Clothing Orders, ATC Representative, 9 1/2 bells
29th - Changing Winds Event
30th - Changing Winds Event
31st - Changing Winds Masquerade Ball, 9 bells
_________________________________________________________

With little or no postings from the Conclave, the VOICE can only post the last known Conclave members,
which are as follows...

Itzal - Ernest Bouldermoore, Wynestra Renley
Pyrous - Thyia Sarantis
Aestraeva - Eleanora O'Hara
Kaleith - Tharansis Joltharsson
Aerthane - Ayderias Clarveau , Blink Walkabout
Tetherias - Rochiriel Azahar

_________________________________________________________

We at the VOICE would like to wish one and all a very Happy New Year, and hope that
Fame and Fortune will find you or follow you where ever you go in 439! Have a safe and
wickedly good time out there tonight !

The VOICE: Changing Winds Masquerade Ball Orders


The famous Merchant Seamstress Marquise Larissa Simone will be in town this Sun Day at nine and a half bells
in the evening to take orders for the upcoming Changing Winds Masquerade Ball. The dusky Devalin has reportedly
just returned from a long sea voyage to her home isle, and will probably be bringing the latest fashions and materials
to her clientele . Larissa usually allows two to three items to be ordered per customer, and can be quite impatient
with clients who do not have their orders pre-thought out and ready. Citizens are advised to show up at least fifteen
minutes early, ( and the ATC merchant will show up fifteen minutes late....probably. )

On a related note, it is rumored that Larissa's sister may be visiting, and a local goblin seems to be having "stirrings"
about the possibility of meeting the famous seamstress' mysterious sibling. Good luck to them both!

The VOICE: Three Bridges News

Three Bridges

Trade has resumed between Rum Village and Three Bridges with the repairing of the Rum Runner.
It is back on the open seas, stopping midway on Dolorous Island at the village of Outlast each trip. One has to
wonder if the three small villages are trying to bypass the Archai Trading Company to do business together, and
if so, what reprisals there may be from the powerful royally-owned ATC. In any case, the situation seems to be
beneficial to Three Bridges, with new items appearing in the stock of many shops there. While some shops are
taking advantage of the influx to raise prices, ( the clothing shop which once catered to the doubloon-impaired
has seen quite the rate hike )...other shops have expanded their inventory to the delight of the regular customers.

The Bridge Burners Smoke Shop seems to have benefited most from the new trade route, and now carries
at least five different varieties of tobacco, as well as cigars, pipes, and boxes from various craftsmen around
the isles. Below is a list of some of the items one can procure at this lovely establishment, which the new trade
route has made available.

* some skunky flake cut tobacco
* some spicy-sweet perique tobacco
* some pungent dried burley tobacco
* some mint-infused chewing tobacco
* some gin-soaked chewing tobacco
* a slender clove-rolled cigarette
* a hand-rolled cigarette
* a unevenly-wrapped malodorous stogie
* a narrow spiced rum-dipped cigar
* a mello maduro leaf-wrapped robusto cigar
* a deep brown oscuro leaf-wrapped corona cigar
* a single-hole bronze table-top cigar cutter
* a square oiled leather smoking pouch
* a sturdy canvas smoking pouch
* a smooth spruce cigarette box
* a frowzy pine stogie box
* a hand-carved cedar cigar box
* a swirl-grained hickory pipe
* a dragons claw-carved black walnut pipe
* a rough hewn mahogany pipe

One of the casualties of the new economy is the Bait Shop, which is under new ownership and currently
appears to cater to...no one. The loss of a place to purchase fishing supplies is felt by all anglers throughout
New Archai, and local woodworkers will most likely try and take up the slack with their hand-made fishing poles
and tackle boxes...if you want bait, you're going to have to go forage up your own grubs!

In a related story, the Pearlean warship the Gold Dragon has been seen out on patrols again. No word on if it is
chasing the Rum Runner or tracking down pirates, but the wise mariner would do well to sail swiftly and stay
close to shore with the King's mighty vessel on the waves again.

The VOICE: Cupcakes and Economics


Master Chef Brooke Willowby will be in the city this Winds day to host a peddle of
"Enigmatic Cupcakes" ... and now you know as much as we at the VOICE do !

Rumors abound that the Master Chef has been working in secret with alchemists,
necromancers, and other scientific types to blend special properties into each delicious
offering that will be available. Since this is a peddle, and not merely an event to place orders,
it is likely that there may be some truth to the rumors.... or perhaps the wiley Chef is merely seeking
a way to increase interest in what would otherwise be a hum-drum affair centered around ordinary
baked confections. Either way, the comestibles in queston will be offered at half past nine bells, most
likely at Howler's Square, in the Delightful Delectables bakery shop. Howler's Square can be found just
southeast of the pearl city outer gate, and just south of the Property Exchange offices. The bakery is on
the southern side of the square, and for a few hundred gold one can purchase sweets elegant enough to
grace the tables of the King himself!

Outside the city, the effects of the economic shifts hitting the isle can be felt most locally at the Burning Bandit,
which has ceased to offer drink or food ! One wonders if the patronage that used to be enjoyed by the famous
old inn was influenced by the cessation of the local custom of Drink Night, or the shift in venue of the local
weekly hunts by Hunt-Leader Blink Walkabout to the city of Pearl. In either case, it seems the Emissary has
single handedly killed the livelyhood of one of Archai's most popular watering holes, perhaps at some financial
benefit to himself or his associates? Only time will tell...

As for the city itself, the newly opened trade-route between Three Bridges, Dolorous, and Rum Village has had
a positive effect on at least one shop within the city. The Marauder's Market is back in business, and those
with the right connections can once again acquire rare and valuable items from non ATC sanctioned trading
companies. If in doubt, contact your local Goblin Merchant!

The VOICE: Conclave News and Attacks!


.Pearl City attacked by Hobgoblin troop!

The city of Pearl came under attack last night by a force of Hobgoblin mercenaries, leaving one Marshal,
one constable, and one Goblin citizen dead. The Goblin, reportedly one Lueghee Spitz, was slain not by
the invading force, but by a City Marshal, who fell shortly after in defense of the city. Witnesses report that
a Black Dragon seemed to be in league with the Hobgoblins, swooping in to devour corpses in the aftermath
of the battle. City archers were able to drive off the beast, but unable to kill it once again.

Conclave Meeting

Conclave met tonight to inform the gathered citizenry of their votes on the two measures brought to them
last month, one of a soup kitchen, and the other a request for a private banker for the temple of Astraeva.
Both measures passed narrowly, with the soup kitchen proposal being amended with the possible location
and cost to be discussed. Many suggestions were made for the location, but the end result seemed to be
somewhere in the area of the academy ferry dock. Emissary Ernest Bouldermoore will undertake the
building of the shop, and will bring forth a cost estimate, which may be lessened by the donation of timber
from local citizens.

After this discussion the talk turned to the recent attack, and Emissary O'Hara commented that the Hobgoblins
might have had help from Three Bridges, since this is the only route from their encampment to Pearl. A Goblin from
that area stated that sentries posted there had no reports of any such force passing through, so the way such
a force entered the city is still a mystery. Conclave then called for discussion of the attack, and Mr. Spitz asked
that city Marshals not murder citizens who are defending the city. This gave way to a lengthy debate on what had
happened and why, with Knight Marshal Ochir ducking and weaving like a trained verbal boxer, avoiding most questions
with a stoic "I am not inclined to speak more upon an open investigation." Strangely enough no witnesses were
taken to the city jail for questioning, as is the norm. One can only suppose that when a city official does the killing,
the less witnesses and testimony, the better! When Knight Marshal Ochir stated "The beast that ate the remains of two
fallen protectors of the city s the real threat" , Emissary Bouldermoore was heard to respond "What? No no. The Black
wouldn't be working with the hobgoblins. He is of Itzal. He'd side with the goblins." ... leading one to believe that the
Dragon is allied with Temple Itzal, who may be allied with the Hobgoblins, all of whom seem determined to take over
the city! As far as anyone can tell, no reprisals are planned by the city against any of the aforementioned parties.
Emissary Bouldermoore has mentioned that a statue should be built to honor Mr. Spitz's brave actions during the attack.

The last item of the evening was Emissary Walkabuot's retirement, and his request to stay on as treasurer due to his city
hunts. Conclave has mentioned that they will consider this request to let a non government citizen be in charge of city
funds, which will be a first if it passes. Prelate Rivalen was heard to comment, "It is my personal opinion that Emissary
Walkabout announced his retirement prematurely. I plan on speaking with him further on the subject in the hopes to
find a course that doesn't have him vacating his post." , and mentioned that he wouldn't be the first emissary to miss
twelve meetings in a row and still be an emissary. Emissaries from Temple Itzal and Temple Kaleith then proclaimed that
there may be vacant Emissary posts to be had, and any wishing to seek them should see the appropriate Conclave member.

Shortly after this announcement the Conclave building shook with the impact of the Black Dragon, which vaulted from it's
perch atop the building and began terrorizing the city again. Archers were called and began their fruitless attempts to
bring the creature down, with many city archers falling to their deaths from high atop the city walls. One such unfortunate
soul landed in the city square, where a local Gavial was heard to inquire if it was illegal to eat dead archers. Luckily
members of temple Astraeva were present, and carried the body off to the cemetery for a proper burial. The Dragon is
still on the loose, and citizens are urged to be wary when traveling, and Not attempt to defend themselves while
within the city limits. Apparently fleeing for one's life is all the rage now?

The VOICE: Conclave News!

Conclave met tonight to vote upon the proposals from their last meeting, and accept new ones
from the citizenry that were in attendance. The Emissaries that were present were as follows:

Emissary Thyia Sarantis of Temple Pyrous,
Emissary Lord Ayderias Clarveu and Emissary Blink Walkabout of Temple Aerthane,
Emissary Eleanora O'Hara of Temple Astraeva,
Emissary Tharansis Joltharsson of Temple Kaleith,
and Emissary Ernest Bouldermoore of Temple Itzal.
Representing the King was Knight Marshal Cascius.

Emissary Menfanous Hammersmith of Temple Astraeva was reportedly present for the closed door voting, but left soon after.

The four proposals from the last meeting were - three applications for a temple banker, ( Temples Aerthane, Pyrous,
and Itzal, all of whom received approval) , and a proposal for a new Conclave meeting day, which has been changed to
the second Wander Day of each month.

The next item was a message from King Sauntere the Eighth, read by his representative Knight Marshal Cascius.
The missive was regarding the events that took place during the Blessing of the Fleet, and marshal Cascius informed
the gathering that the king has decided not to speak with citizens regarding this event, but is planning a return trip
as quickly as possible, this time with an entire fleet of ships. Although the King stated he would not speak with citizens,
Cascius informed Conclave that "He does however plan to address the city before his fleet sets sail, to further explain
his position on a return of dragons" and that "he still honors the act put in place by King Dividicus the first that outlawed
the practice of hunting dragons". When questioned about those helping to defend the city during Dragon attacks, Cascius
responded, "That is a question that has come up behind closed doors. Defense of the city is the King's first charge and
he is considering how best to move forward in regards to that." It may be that the King is growing weary or afraid of
the magical beasts, and is looking to strike a deal with whatever Dragon he can find.

Confidential sources that have been in touch with the VOICE have it on good authority that the King plans to sail with the
fleet when they set out for the dragon island, probably with chests of Gold to bribe the aforementioned creatures, leaving
the city if pearl in the hands of........? If anyone was ever tempted to take over the city, now would be the time to do it.


After these announcements three citizens stepped forth to bring their proposals before Conclave.
The first was Eabo Shadowhunter, a goblin from the Three Bridges area who applied for the (supposedly) vacant
second seat of Itzal upon the Conclave. The application sent Emissary O'Hara into fits of apoplectic rage, and she was
heard to utter such racist things as...

"This be preposterous! A goblin can't be sitting on the council!" ,
" Goblins can't be emissaries",
"I be warning ye all, goblins being on the council and having they own banker be a bad move for Pearl",
and ..."I Don't need to be reading applications from a goblin."

No one could tell whether the Emissary was drunk, senile, or just plain narrow-minded, but she sets a unique example
for her Temple-mates and all other followers of the "Light". During the questioning that followed, much of which
seemed aimed at making good-natured fun of Mr. Shadowhunter's height or personal hygiene, Emissary Bouldermoore
was heard to comment, "Are you prepare to suddenly go missing one day, abducted into a secret society of ex-emissaries
that are off living a better life?" ...possibly alluding to the habit of Emissaries suddenly disappearing without even a note
to their temple-mates or friends - (foul play has been suspected in more than one of these instances).
When asked if anyone in Temple Itzal had the authority to confirm Emissary Wynestra Renley's removal or Mr.
Shaddowhunter's approval for her position by this Temple, a citizen named Kaiah (last name unknown) responded,
"You're hearing from the temple leadership now" , leading one to believe that she has assumed the roll of Grand High
PoohBah (for lack of a better or formally known title) of Temple Itzal. Mr. Shadowhunter answered questions as skillfully
as any current Conclave member, and was even seen distributing edible bribes in the form of cranberry cabbage bakes.
His application will be voted on during the next Conclave meeting.

A second Goblin then took the podium and inquired about his proposal from the last meeting, which according to
Lord Clarveu, had seemingly "fell though the cracks", which answers the question of why one might seek a goblin
presence on the conclave. Mr. Molvix Squibblin's proposal of using local goblin scouts to deliver couriered messages
throughout the Isle will be tabled ... again ... till the next Concalve meeting when answers to questions such as
message fees,Costs, supplies, insurance this service shall not be misused, and indemnity for non deliveries can be found.
Although alternatives have OFTEN been requested to the local sludge potions, we wish Mr. Squibblin luck!

The last item of the night was the announcement of apprenticeship to Merchant Lephierna by local citizen Geel Brin.
Mr. Brin seeks to begin a trade in Fine Tobaccos, Smoking utensils and other glass objects d' Art. The notice was a
formality, and once the apprenticeship is complete, Mr. Brin will return with his sponsor to complete the process and
become a full fledged ATC merchant, (all of whom are probably members in good standing of the local thieves guild!)
Good Luck to Mr. Brin in his new endeavor!

The VOICE: Alumni Day a success!

Alumni Day Event
The annual Alumni Day festivities were held today at the newly created New Archai Coliseum and Event Center, which was
reportedly designed by members of temple Aerthane and Conclave Draftspersons, and built by the Archai Trading Company.
The event, which featured crafting displays, free food, prizes and a recount of the Shattering, was a huge hit, with crowds of
students and Pearlean citizens attending. Presenters included Mr. Lueghee Spitz, giving an informative demonstration of
smithing and smelting, Master-Gemcutter Coraleth , who plied his trade with with elegance and aplomb, and recent
Conclave initiate Emissary Eabo Shadowhunter, who gave a swift and precise display of tailoring. All the presenters made
gifts of their crafts to the students in the audience, as did Master Chef Seren Brin, who catered the event with comestibles
fit for a king! The crowd was also presented with commemorative coins, and students who stayed till the end were presented
with excellent armors provided by a local armorsmith, most probably Vogrok Silverforge. The evening ended with a
slightly shortened presentation of the events of the Shattering by Lord Ayderias Clarveu, who always draws a crowd
where ever he speaks. The annual event was presided over by Prelate Trystan Rivalen, one of the foremost
graduates of the academy and a true community leader.

The Coliseum and Event Center, which may remain open for a short while before closing until the next event, contained
a small food stall and a gift shop filled with unique items for the discerning buyer. Make sure and visit it if you can - the
design and elegance of the building is without equal in New Archai!

The VOICE: Fleet Sailing Tonight!


Royal Mission

The Royal fleet will send ships forth tonight on a journey to the uncharted isles that are
believed to be home to a flight of Dragons. King Sauntere the 8th has also decreed that
volunteers be allowed on the naval vessel - The Gold Dragon, apparently as witnesses and
perhaps extra crew hands in case things go awry on this "peaceful mission" . Those wishing to
make the journey should be at the King's Docks, just northwest of the trade / pawnshop of Pearl
no later than nine bells. Although this is deemed a peaceful mission, any venture outside of Pearl
should be fully equipped and armed and armored. Those accustomed to sea voyages will probably bring
fishing gear and pillows or stools for seating comfort.

New Office

The VOICE of Pearl has recently acquired a new office, on a path just outside of the Burning Bandit.
The Bandit Owner has graciously provided space upon their land for a small but important service
to be established, and the VOICE will begin publishing and distribution from this site. Customers
may purchase supplies, or leave notes for the staff in a drop box within the building. Applications
for staff positions or reports or comments should be sent to the VOICE scribe, as per usual.
We look forward to your business!

The VOICE: Latest News

Local News


Knight Marshal Ochir has made it known that the King will be speaking this Sun day on the topic
of Dragons, and what ever else his little heart desires. The proclamation came with little else, but one
would assume that the local Monarch will once again be speaking from his balcony, and word on the street
is that the chosen time for this oration will be nine bells, the exact same time as the ATC's Land & Sea
Property Exchange furniture peddle ! It seems strange that the King would usurp his own company's
profitable peddle, and as yet there has been no word from the ATC's scribe as to a cancellation or postponement
of the event. The King's speech comes just after the latest Conclave gathering, in which most Temple representatives
gave their approval for the inclusion of Dragon-kind into the city's populace. Of note: a proposal by the Aerthanian Prelate
Trystan Rivalen was made at this same gathering, proposing an expedition into the area north of the Crooked Sisters
in order to address the possibility of curing the Mossy Butter Plague that still runs rampant there.
The proposal was considered, but will first need to be sent to the Crown for inspection and Royal Decree. No word
yet as to whether the proposal will make it to the King before his speech.

With all the recent Dragon activity it looks likely that the huge beasts will be among us soon, and wise citizens
should prepare themselves accordingly. Will the possession of Electrum Spears, Dragonscale armor and such items
become a crime? Will those found consorting with Wyvern-kind, whether by choice or not, be prosecuted? Only time,
( and perhaps the King ) will tell !

The VOICE: Blessing of the Fleet

The Gold Dragon made it's yearly pilgrimage to Baninau Bay with no mishaps, as usual,
and the handful of passengers on board were all blessed by the High Priest of Kaleith and
should find themselves knee-deep in fish and other such things for the rest of the year!
Two passengers were picked up during the stop-over...Lord Ayderias, and Ambassador Thyia,
both of whom were overheard to mention having come into certain information that -MAY- be
shared with the general populace at some later time... if the price is right!
Our hearty well-wishes to the two travelers on their home-coming!
