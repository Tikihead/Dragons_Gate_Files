Welcome to Urda

The Evening Star would like to offer a little help
 to those new to Urda. The town is Quite large,
 and can be a little confusing at first.
 There are many shops and forms of entertainment
 availible to travelers, so we'd like to give you a few
 directions to places of interest.
From the main South gate, travel 5 blocks north, and 5 blocks
 east to reach the Bank of Urda.  The Urda  town square is
 10 blocks north of the South gate,  and 5 blocks east of that
 is the main training hall. Two blocks east of the square is the
 Inn…and quite an Inn it is too!  Two blocks west of the
 square is the Lonely Moon: Stars Club. The rowdiest townspeople
 can be found here every nite! Go see for yourself, but
 beware the Bouncers!

Three blocks north of the Urda Square, you turn east to reach
the temple district. Please walk quietly, as many are in devotion
 throughout the day and night.
 If you are interested in shopping, 5 blocks north of the South gate
 the eastern road leads to the Merchant area, where you  will find
 weapons, armor, lights, trinkets, magic items, clothes, and a bakery!
 Those of you looking for more clandestine items should go one
 block north and 4 blocks west of the south gate. Archery
supplies may be had by continuing all the way west
and 5 blocks north.

 There are other places to see, and more shops opening soon,
so check back here in the future for more information
on the great city of Urda!

Thanks for reading the Evening Star!

Merchant Council calls meeting


 The Merchant Council of Urda has today called a meeting
 and invited the citizens of Urda to attend. Speculations run wild
 about the purpose of the meeting, though it is probable that
 the council is looking to fill a few more seats , and by doing so,
 expand it's coffers.
 With the recent construction in the city, it is possible that
 many new stalls could be availible throughout the city, and
 investors would be wise to snap up such an opportunity to
place themselves in a position to direct the growth and
 commerce of Urda.

 The meeting is to be held in the Merchant Council chambers,
 five blocks southwest of the Urda town square in two days,
 at eight bells , EST ( Eternal Silvarin Tree time) .
The Evening Star plans to cover the event, and hopes
you will check back here for more information as
the events unfold.

 Recent happenings within the City!

 The Merchant Council meeting has been moved up one day,
 do to recent events within the city. The meeting will take place
 in the Council of Peers room of the Judicial Forum building,
 at eight bells , EST ( Eternal Silvarin Tree time) .
 From the Urda town square, travel southwest on Talioun March,
 the wonderful marble walkway, then up the steps and through 
 the doors inside. There is room for all, but the benches are hard,
 so bring a pillow!

 Western Gatehouse Cleared!

A message from the illustrious Tailoring Craftmistress
Ayaliute Jesildhya had citizens gathering around the western
gatehouse earlier this evening. Several well known Urdanites,
including Shadow and Kurapiira of the Fey, Cedar and Lucienne
of the Galirrim, and Khana of the Varanus, joined Ayaliute of the
Duskwen in challenging the riddle that has been posed
 by the blocking of the west gate.
 Cedar and Lucienne managed to force the rubble from
the passage, using the great strength of their race, but no
sooner had an opening been made , then enemies poured
through! Fortunately no lives were lost, and the roadway
to the west is now cleared for travel and trade.
 The intrepid troop that cleared the gateway chose to
venture forth for quite a long distance to the west, and
returned with many strange tales.  It is believed that the
Merchant Council will put forward a motion to install signs
along this route, advising all who venture forth of the
dangers inherent in such a journey.

 Several of the expeditions members were questioned, and tales
of large ants, possesed deer and giant spders as well as word
of a village in the heart of this dark western forrest were passed
around. The stories seemed almost unbeleiveable,… until one
noticed the ragged state of those who returned,
 and the copious amounts of blood about their persons.

 Stay close to your local hearald or town crier for more
information on these remarkable doings.

 Thanks for reading the Evening Star.

Sandwyrms, Demonds, and Merchants


 The Merchant Council of Urda held an open meeting
 today at the Judicial Forum building.
 The current two members of the council, Ayaliute Jesildhya
  the Threadmistress, and Talafon Durgrim, Weaponmaster of Urda
 spoke at length about their travels and plans for the city.
Ayaliute told of a lond sea voyage, and the discovery of Sandwyrms
 and the precious wyrmsilk milked from the very mouths of these
 behemoths. Wyrmsilk is said to be very malleble, and could be
 made into magic friendly armor. What we wait to hear now
 is the cost of such a rare material.

 Talafon Spoke of travels around Urda, and the clearing of the
 east road, and a northern passage past the old ghost town
 outside the northgate. Swamps and Ghoblin tribes and Demonds
 seem to be waiting for any who dare brave the norhtern trails.
 Talafon also mentioned Tanacite, a rare mineral used in the
 crafting of armor and weapons.

 The council also disscussed the clearing of the western gate,
 and plans to rebuild the gatehouse there. Motions were also
passed for signage warning all travelers heading west of
the immenent dangers to be had along that road.

As for the Merchant Council itself, five seats were announced to
 be vacated, and up for grabs by any citizen who can qualify!
 Please check the Merchant Council boards for more information
 along these lines.
 The meeting ended with questions to the council about
shop ownership, and housing availability, both of which
will soon become availible to the intrepid few with the
right stuff….namely Crowns!

 Notes of this meeting have been posted on the Merchant
Council boards by none other than myself, Kurapiira Mako
– scribe of Temple Karishta, temporary Merchant Council scibe,
and proprieter of the Evening Star.

Please drop by and give them a look!

Massive deathtoll! Wolf contracts rabies!..Infects Urda!


It is believed that a Galirrim wolfman conntracted Rabies
 from the blood of a Fungal Spider, and went mad in Urda
late last night, killing all of the towns citizens. Witnesses say
this being was frothing at the mouth, and had an insane
 gleam to it's eyes. A few citizens were able to reach the
 safety of the Travers training town, and Identified the
 mad beast as none other than Beor Bayouwolf, a noted
 hunter – explorer, and the dirtiest Galirrim known to
 exist.  Beor is currently on the loose, his whereabouts unknown.
 If you see this Being, contact the Urdaian Guard immediately!
The staff of the Evening star advises all who live
 or work in the area to Stay Away from Urda till the
 bodies have been properly disposed of and this Gallirrim
 has been apprehended. And PLEASE do not touch or strip the
 corpses!

 In a related story, several toothless strippers were said to
have been found among the bodies, but with no sign of rabies
about them. Rumors of a stag party for the local Dragon
 and sacrifices to that same being were heard to circulate
 throughout the evening.

 Stay tuned for more on this devastating Horror!
_________________________________________

Fasion change in Urda


Several Urdaian's have been seen about town
 in tribal garments, a new and trendy fashion in the
 city and surronding areas. Many new trade items have also
 been found circulating thru the hands of lucky
 merchants and their select customers.  Rumors abound
 about the source of these amazingly well crafted items,
 and the difficulty in procuring said products.

 One savvy adventurer was overhead to say that
 such things were of Tsakaxhuan origin, and the tiny
 village in the deep forrest has been alive with new
 visitors ever since.

 Items rumored to be available are primitive clothing,
loin cloths, grass skirts, pipes and smokable herbs,
 exotic foods and body jewelry….

 So if you wish to keep up with the latest fasion trends,
 keep an eye out for caravans and hunting parties headed west…
 The trip could well be worth your while!

Temple Johara in hot water with Merchant Council

The Merchant Council of Urda has received information
that Temple Johara has been involved with attacks
upon City Guardsmen. The Merchant Council, in a closed
door session, has moved that a fine of 300 crowns
be levied against Temple Johara for their
wild and disrespectful congregation's actions.

It it is especially degrading that they would do so
while we are suffering attacks from Baelros,
and any citizens witnessing such attacks should
report them to a council member, merchant, or
city guard captain at once.

The merchant Council has decreed that should the fine
fail to be paid, the doors of Temple Johara in Urda
will be closed. It is rumored that the Religious Council
may have a word to say to the Merchant Council
about their actions, but ultimately the Merchant
Council controls the guarding of the city, and Temple
leaders should remember this when gathering in
the Religious Council to address this matter.

Temple Johara may be able to approach the Merchant
Council with an alternative to the fine….they are
merchants after all.

As of this day, Temple leaders will need to contact
each other to establish a solid footing for the
Religious Council. For those of you who do not know,
The Religious Council is autonomous in the discipline
and teaching of its congregations, yet they are able
to submit motions to the Merchant Council and hold
titles to Registrations of Commerce.

Any pleas of hearing turned over to them from a
Court of Peers, are dealt with at the discretion of
the current members, so perhaps if Temple Johara
wishes to single out certain individuals for punishment,
a Court of Peers could be called.

All information in this article is directly obtained from
the Merchant Council and it's representatives.

More information will be written here as it becomes
available.

Arena Exhibition a success

The first ever Arena Exhibition match was held today
in the Urda Arena. Citizens from all over, and of every
race of peoples came to watch the bloody sports hosted
by Geza , the mysterious Urgon Arena Master.

The first match was a battle between Soreth the Galirrim,
and Gomakatsu of the Seraphim. Gomakatsu wielded
his morning star with elegance and skill, but the teeth
and moonsilver throwing spears of Soreth proved to be
too great to defeat. Gamakatsu was killed after a long
and bloody battle to the death.

The second match was one of magick users, between one
Seren the Human, and Daelor, of the Duskwen peoples.
Seren called upon fire and water to both whip and choke
his opponent, but the firey spells and flame elemental
of the demondkin were too much for the wiley human,
and Seren was forced to ask for quarter. Daelor
granted it, and the match was called, with no death
for the human as a result.

Wild speculation and many challenges were tossed
back and forth as the evening wore on, and as the last
match was about to begin, two more of the duskwen
peoples arrived. Ayaliute the Craftmistress, and
Asher the mage. However the final match
for the night was between the two winners, Soreth
and Daelor. Daelor summoned his evil pet, an
Elemental being, and threw his spells almost continually
at Soreth, however the big Galirrim was able to use his
skills and moonsilver throwing spears to great
advantage, and thus defeated the expertly skilled Daelor.
No quarter was asked, so this match also ended with
the death of the Duskwen.

After the match, Ayaliute approached Soreth in reguards to
a position as her Champion, and the Gallirrim expressed
interest. The position of Champion being related to the
Games that Geza will be holding in an Elvish week.
(Two weeks as the city tells time).

All the combatants were highly praised by the onlookers
for their skill and bravery, and congratulations were given
to the Urgon for her masterful organization of the
spectacular event.

For any who missed it, a good time was had by all,
and most of the city turned out for the event, which will
begin it's regular season in just a short time. Check your
local bulletin boards and this paper for more information
on the upcoming Gladiator Games!

A Notice to the Merchant Council

The following notice was asked to be posted here
on behalf of the Temple of Johara.

******************************************

The temple of Johara does not endorse the
killing of any city guards or workers. The charges brought
upon us by the merchant's council are false and unfounded.

Their decision is based purely on factless assumptions. It is
very displeasing that the council should make such a rash
decision without any representation from our temple.

The temple of Johara and its followers request to meet
with the council to clear up any confusion and present the
facts regarding this matter. It is time the long silenced
religious council step up and accept our duties to protect
us all from these types of hastily made decisions.

******************************************

Disclaimer: This note did not carry the Seal of Johara,
nor does this paper endorse or condone any
statements made herein.

The Arena Games Begin !

The Arena Master Geza has commissioned a
most awe inspiring stadium to be built in
the heart of the bloodlands, and the citizens
of Urda are flocking to see some of the most
noble and ferocious gladiators around test
themselves in the heat of battle in the first ever
Arena Games!

Upon entering the Grand Hallway of the
New Yisra Colosseum, one is treated to the
awe inspiring sight of a glistening ivory
statue of the Arena Master herself, Geza
the Great, while a massive chandelier lights
the grey and black marble floor, as red rock
walls are adorned with ornamental weapons
of old. Two very large mesquite stair cases
align both walls going up to the spectator seats,
and the north wall has both a blue and a red door,
each with a sign that reads "Gladiators only" above it.
A high arch of columns leads to a hall in the west
where the clink of coin and the fast-talking of bookies
are waiting to take any bets that are put forth.

Ever the merchant warrior, Geza has installed stalls
and shoppes for those wishing to purchase mementos
of their visit to the colosseum. Haorrun's Hobbies and
Collectibles sells many interesting items, including
Gladiator trading cards, and stuffed likenesses for
the young ones, while other stalls sell adult beverages
and unique foods, and offer repairs to those in need.

The first nights events were most memorable, with
many of the city's finest citizens showing up for the
inaugural opening. Among those attending were,
Soreth the Galirrim, (Preserver of Eyranas and a local
favorite) Eridan the Fae, Gomakotsu the
Seraphim, Aethlyn the Silvarin, Ayaliute the Duskwen,
(member of the Merchant Council, and Patron of gladiators)
Feir the Vorngar, Salevos the Aka'thri, Seren the Human,
Kyris the Silvarin, Aegys the Silvarin , Asher the
Duskwen, Maria the Silvarin, Desmond the Silvarin,
Gault the Fae , Kathryn the Human, Esche the Fae,
Geza the Urgon, (Hostess of the nights revelries)
Harru the Galirrim, Daelor the Duskwen, Cansa the
Urgon, Maltrinus the Vorngar, and Lisel the Human.

After many thrilling and Very close battles, the following
results were to be seen :
.
Round 1
Asher vs Soreth:… Winner – Asher
Aethlyn vs Daelor:… Winner – Aethlyn
Dernum vs Lisel:… Winner – Lisel
Gomakotsu vs Vashane:…
( Winner by default: Gomakatsu)
Gault vs Eridan:… Winner- Eridan
Seren vs Maltrinus:… Winner – Maltrinus

Round 2
Asher vs Aethlyn:… Winner – Aethlyn
Gomaktsu vs Seren:
Winner – Gomaktsu, Seren yielded
Daelor vs Soreth:… Winner – Soreth
Gault vs Lisel:… Winner- Gault
Maltrinus vs Dernum:… Winner – Maltrinus
Vashane vs Eridan
( Winner was Eridan by default)

There was much speculation on the whereabouts
of the Gladiator Vashane, some even stating that
he had been waylaid on purpose, to give the other
Gladiators an edge , or perhaps affect the odds at
the betting tables. Whatever the case may be,
the opening night of the New Yisra Colosseum
was a huge success, and citizens can look forward to
more spectacular nights like this for a long time
to come.

Our most warm and heartfelt congratulations go
out to Geza, for her incredible contribution to
Urdaian society , her hard work and dedication
can be an inspiration to us all. Bravo!..or as the
Gladiators say, "we who are about to die Salute you!"

Merchant Council calls meeting


The chamberlain of the Merchant Council,
Talafon Durgrim, has called a meeting of the Council
in just six days time, on human Moonday, at
eight bells EST (Eternal Silvarin Tree – time).

No word yet as to the nature of the meeting,
or if it is an open meeting, or a closed door session.
Speculation runs rampant, as there could be many
reasons for this gathering of some of the most powerful
individuals in Urda. Is it to address the Temple Johara
issue, or perhaps to admit new members into the
council to fill the seats left vacant when the last
Chamberlain and the Mistress of the Coffer absconded
with a (supposedly) very large withdrawal of city funds?
No one knows for sure, but the Council has been run
by the two surviving members for a while, and the
Religious Council would do well to remember this,
and step forward to cast their votes when they would
do the most good !

More to come on this portentous event !

Week two of the Arena Games

Week two of the Arena Games in the bloodlands
went off without a hitch…and without the
Arena Master, bloodmistress Geza. Salevos
of the Aka'Thri peoples was the host of the
nights festivities, and he performed his
duties most admirably. Noticeably absent
was Ayaliute Jesildhya , craftmistress and
patron of gladiators. Some say the betting last
week took it's toll on the noble council member,
but her champion Soreth the Preserver showed up,
and was able to win a victory in the blooded sand.

Geza's champion Lisel, also won a victory, some say
due to the hard training her patron has put her through,
but also yielded a match Unfought, much to the chagrin
of the crowd. No word yet on how her patron is taking
the news.

In a surprise move, Vashane of the Duskwen
appeared halfway through the events, and was able to claim
his first victory. After seeing the intrepid mage in action,
many of the bookies began re-estimating the odds at once.

Next week should see things back to normal, with Geza
back in charge, and betting re opened in the gambling hall.
Please check the Battler's Beacon for updates on winners
and odds for all of the gladiators. And if you missed this
week, make sure not to miss next week. It might be
Free Ale Night!..come on down and see !

Demonic Attacks Reported!

Demon attacks have been reported throughout
the Isle of Wingaurd, and intended victims
include Merchant and Religious Council
members, as well as many citizens and the
city guard. No one knows what prompted these
attacks, but many believe that these attacks
are just a first wave, and the forces behind the
insidious incursions are merely testing the defenses
of the Isle of Winguard . No word as yet
on the fate of other islands within the Shroud, though
perhaps merchants or sailors will soon be able to
shed some light on the matter.

Citizens are warned to travel in groups, and carry
religious or holy items to help ward themselves in
these dangerous times. The Urda city guard has
been put on alert , and confidence remains high.
Anyone having witnessed an attack is urged to
report it to the Urda city guard captain, or post of
it on the city bulletin board. Anyone with information
or ideas on why these attacks are occurring may
contact any city leader, or this paper, in hope of
finding a solution to the matter.

Be safe and pay heed to your local town crier!

Annual Harvest Moon Festival brings suprise...

The Annual Harvest Moon festival reached
it's peak tonight, with the appearance of the
the Evil Alchemists Reyilia Homene Boedaen,
and Thadelius Cernolian Boedaen. The mausoleum
in the festival became a battleground as local
heros fought the rising of the sibling sorcerers.

A Goblin treasure hunter was killed , but ancient
tomes were recovered from the spirits and slaves
that did battle , however no one has been able
to translate the texts that appear to be in some
unknown language. Anyone with a skill in
history or ancient languages should seek out Laro
of the Human peoples if they wish to assist in
decoding this mystery. Maltrinus of the Vorngar
found a hidden experimentation room, with a
hapless Fae subject still chained to the wall.
All efforts to release the fae failed, but release
from pain was offered till such a time as the
spells of binding can be broken.

All citizens are warned that the northern part
of the festival is considered dangerous, and care
should be taken when traveling there, however
the main festival grounds have been host to many
exciting peddles, and should be safe to travel.

There is a tattoo / marking peddle to be held at
eight bells Elvish tomorrow , and Talafon will
hold a weapon peddle at nine bells, following the
former peddle.

More news on the Annual festival and events
around Urda coming soon !

Harvest Moon Festival ends with a Bang!

The Annual Harvest Moon Festival concluded
last night with a costume contest held by the
elegant craftmistress Ayaliute. In attendance were
many of Urda's foremost citizens, though masks
and costumes made it hard to tell who was who!

Rodrigo the Mesmerizer arrived to advertise his
upcoming presence at the Arena, and two citizens
showed up as Reyilla and Thadelius, the Boedaen
twins, (quite scary for those of us who fought their
shades a short time ago!) Agnes the witch appeared,
warts and all, to curse those who did not vote for her,
and someone in a Swamp Devil costume was also seen!

Amazing food and drinks were offered to all by the hostess,
and the costume contest was won by the Boedaen twins,
who each won a custom ensemble to be made by Ayaliute,
after which Neilla of the famous Lobster head- dress asked
Rodrigo to mezmerize Thadelius into following her home.
The magician apparently succeded, as they both left in
company, and were not seen again! ( A small moment
of fashion oh-oh as Neilla and Agnes appeared wearing
the same form fitting black cotton dress!) Also attending
the Bash were Varuuna , Chillo, and obsmin, (some of
whom may or may not have been in costume.)

As the festivities were wrapping up, Desmond stepped
from the shadows just as a strange feeling fell over the
city, and Ayaliute called for all to return to Urda
immediately. Upon arrival we found several citizens
fighting Demons! Pit fiends were attacking, and the
Vorngar Jurgandaem (demon hunter) called Jager
showed his skill in dispatching them with the help
of locals and Urdain guards.

Some confusion ensued about Ayaliute being a
Demon ( She IS a duskwen, after all) and Ayaliute
began to feel ill as the hunters used the local message
service in the merchant's run to contact others to aid
Urda in it's time of need. Maltrinus and Jager joined
forces, and several Galirrim of the Eyranian Hunt
answered the call of Varuuna to help defend the city
and it's surrounding lands.
Seen in the group were many skilled individuals,
including Desmond the Silvarin, Obsmin the Duskwen,
Maria the Silvarin, Seren the Human, Kassi the Human,
Aegys the Silvarin, Riyan the Human, and Harru ,
Bjeorn ,Varuuna, and Raabilis of the Galirrim.

After many hard battles, Jager led a small force to
restore the runes of warding in the Travers graveyard,
while Maltrinus led the main group in battle, to give
Jager time and delay the demonic forces. As the last
rune was fixed, a deadly Xahc appeared, and all joined
forces in a battle that was almost lost, to banish the last
of the demonic intruders.

All now seems quiet in Urda and the surrounding
towns , and the Annual Festival is ended, but… will the
wards hold? Is Ayaliute still affected by the miasma
she felt on that night? Will Desmond be affected by his
momentary handling of the flesh of the Xahc'tcha?

These and many more questions will be on the minds
of all in the coming days, and the Evening Star will be
here to keep you informed!

Infection Update

***back from a brief hiatus, the Evening Star brings you
the following Public Service Announcement***

The Varanus Gashashalk has contracted the Slug Nug
fever, killing some eight slugs while in Urda today, and
flinging the slime all over the town square. He then
proceeded to touch heralds and guards and others,
possibly spreading the infection even more.

The cleric Rukshana happened by and offered her
treatment to the Varanus, which consisted of a poultice
of tobbaco, which seemed to ease the itching associated
with the disease. Chokeweed was also tried in an effort
to bring down the fever. The Seraphim Primum was
Gashashalk's hunting partner, but seemed unaffected
by the disease,…. perhaps a racial immunity. Rigel
the human offered a honey mead to be poured upon
the scales, but it seemed to have no effect.

As a public health notice, Boots should be worn
At All Times while within the city limits, and gloves
are recommended.

Melvin Spotted!

The long lost goblin child Melvin, son of Goro, was spotted
late last night in Urda, near the Rose Peacock. The youngling
was seen in the company of various courtesans and gamblers,
and seemed to be in good health. There is still no word on what
adventures Melvin has been upon, or if Goro has been notified
of the return of his offspring. All notices of the missing goblin
youth have been taken down, and the local guard has been notified.

Killers Confronted

Members of the UPL and Captain Thurmdall met tonight
to confront the gang of hoodlums terrorizing Urda. It is
unknown at this time what transpired, or what effect this
meeting will have upon the current situation, however
readers are urged to report here any information they
may have obtained concerning these meetings, and the
individuals that are being sought for questioning.

Tattoos & Trouble!

Master Murasa Sem passed through Urda tonight, and opened
up shop in the magic store just northwest of the town square.
The tattooist was in fine form, and many lucky folk found themselves
freshly inked, however some trouble erupted around those gathered
to await master Sem's services. A Silvarin male seemed to find issue
with most of those in the line, and many were confused about who
was next in said line, while a group of goblins made a circus of the fine
event. The self proclaimed Goblin King, Sliktibbits was present, as well
as others of the nefarious race, who called themselves a troop,
a sindicate, and many other interesting titles. One thing was clear,
when the group saw master Sem emerge from each session, they
immediately fell to creating chaos, and trying to rob the illustrious
Master in the confusion.
Guards were called, but to no avail, and one luckless herald lost his life
in what seemed a prelude of the goblin invasion that may strike the city.
Citizens are cautioned to keep a close eye on their pets, as goblins seem
to like small creatures to play with. Wanted for questioning are
Garlik, Lizzie, Goro, and Nanrak, as well as the would be Goblin King
Sliktibbits. Information should be given to the officer on watch at
the city gates.

More on these happenings as events unfold,

Attacks Threaten City !

A caravan and Temple Eyranas were attacked earlier today by
by creatures of fire. Rumours of attacks upon other temples and
citizens of Urda were circulating through the city, and several
strange orbs were recovered during the fray. Still unknown is the
intent of the attacks, or who is the mastermind behind them, however
a member of the city guard, one Rayton , gathered evidence and will
present this to the guard captain for inquiry. All citizens with knowledge
of these events are asked to speak with any member of the city guard, or
post a note upon the city bulletin board. The fire damage to Hero's rest
is minimal, and business there should continue uninterrupted for now.

Please check back for more information as it becomes available

First Social Event of the season a Success!

The First Annual Bee's Knees Talent Showdown was held today
in Urda at the Red Peacock , in the fabulous East Ballroom,
and was a smashing success. The event was sponsored by
the Buzz Editor in Chief, Kassi Boyd, a rising star in Urda's
social scene, and rumored to be an aspirant to the Merchant
Council.

The event was attended by many notable citizens, including
Lawson the Human, Rosh the Aka'thri , Garlik the Goblin ,
Versul the Human , Goro the Goblin, Wollmaus the Vorngar ,
Lilia the Fae- Exalted of Temple Cassien , Wayvan the Silvarin,
Aldo Pennwinter- Owner of the Red peacock , Findal the Human,
Seren the Human-Oracle of Temple Karishta, Sliktibbits the Goblin ,
Lizzie the Goblin, Rodrigo the Silvarin Mezmerizer ,
Vynter the Silvarin , Charity the Silvarin , and Primum the Seraphim .

The evening started off with Garlik showing his talent of belching
the entire alphabet, followed by an amazing performance by Rodrigo
the Mezmerizer , a definite crowd favorite, tho not part of the
competition. Versul then gave an illuminating forging demonstration,
followed by the hilarious Goro, the Goblin Comedian. Rosh Ambo
sang a touching song of his people, as did Wollmaus, and the event
ended with the frightening knife act of Wayvan and Lilia.

As social events go, this was a definate coup for Kassi, tho the event
was riddled with mayhem, as the local Goblin contingent made their
presence known in a colorful and disruptive fashion.
Judging the event were, the owner of The Red Peacock, Aldo Penwinter,
Oracle of Temple Karishta Seren Prilos, and standing in for the
Craftmisstress Ayaliute, myself, Kurapiira Mako.

The judging was close, ( i can definitely tell you!) but in the end
the knife throwing act of Wayvan and Lilia won, with Rosh's heartfelt
ballad garnering first runner up. Door prizes were won by Versul (who
chose a custom tailored outfit certificate) Wollmaus (who chose a
certificate for an instrument made of Silver Fir) and Goro, who
refused his prize over a dispute that Wayvan, (manager of the
Peacock) should not have been allowed to compete, much less win.

Regardless of the results, the event was a total success, and aside from
the hijinx of the local Goblin horde, went off without a hitch. Rumours
were flying as to the missing Ayaliute, and her possible waylayance by
a certain Aka'Thri Captain, however all expect to see her at the
Merchant Council meeting in 2 days time. Fine brandy and sinfully
good tiramisu were the hors'd'ouevers of the day, and can be purched
at the Waterfall Cafe, just inside the main entrance of the Red Peacock.
As far as fashions go, all manner of fine attire was seen at the event,
as citizens did their best to outdo each other for the first social event
of the season.

The Evening Star would like to congratulate Kassi Boyd, and the Buzz
for putting on a show to remember, and wish them well in all future
endeavors. Hopefully more of the residents of Urda will be able to
attend future events hosted by local merchants, and show their
support for the fledgling social scene of our fabulous city.

Letters from our Readers

This letter arrived from one of our readers, and was asked
to be published as soon as possible. The Evening Star does
not endorse or condemn any opinions or viewpoints put
forth in the following:

Editor's Note: Extensive research was needed to translate the
original document into the common tongue, any errors are
the responsibility of the editor.

**********************************************************

Written on behalf of Goro-

I would like to apologize to Kassi Boyd and the Buzz for my words
following the the Bees Knees talent show. My anger should not have
been directed at her or her staff. My anger should have been directed
at the questionable judging. It seemed highly suspicious that Wayvan,
the Manager of the Red Peacock Inn, ultimately won a contest that
was held at this establishment with his boss as one of the judges.
Had I been aware of this connection, I would have voiced my concern
earlier in the day regarding this apparent conflict of interest. I suggest
some transparency on the next event, to avoid any questionable
ethics surfacing.

I'd like to extend a special thanks to Kurapiira for assisting me after
the show, Lillia for her verbal support, and the Seraphim in Town
Square, whose name escapes me at the moment, for assisted me
in a matter of a financial nature.

Due to the questionable results of the above mentioned talent show,
I have heard whispers of boycotting future shows. I urge all
townsfolk to reconsider that course of action. It would be unfair
to Kassi and the rest of her staff that worked hard to put
this show together.

Signed,
GoRo

Letters from our readers are always welcome, and will be
printed in an unbiased and strightforward fasion.

Merchant Council meeting and New Members

The Merchant Council of Urda held an open meeting today
in the Council Chamber, just outside of the Bank of Urda.
Council members Talafon Durgrim, Chamberlain, Master
Renomi Thurman, Minister of the Coffer, and Ambassador
of Trade Ayaliute Jesildhya were present, as well as Temple
Leaders the Exalted Lilia Lacey, Oracle Seren Prilos, Avatar
Desmond Delavan, Preserver Kurapiira Mako, and Servitor
Maria Saldis.

Dame Elethene Coelm of the Idarian Order spoke of the
dissolution of the Order as it stands, and it's new role in the
governing of Urda. The Knights shall obey the command of
the Merchant Council and the Lord General of the Milita.
The Knighthood will be comprised of three orders:
The Order of the Guardians
The Order of the Justicars
The Order of the Demon Hunters
(This last Order is sponsored by a noble Vorngar by the name of
Jager Banrognson , whose order of demon slayers has joined the
Knights, and the methods and secrets of their practice are to be
passed on to Urda's Order of the Demon Hunters )

After describing the Orders and their duties to the assembled,
Ambassador Ayaliute made the following declaration to her:

"By order of the Merchant Council of Urda, in unanimous
vote during closed session, we appoint you Lord General of
the Militia, overseer of the Knights of Urda.

After much congratulations, two citizens who had applied
for council membership, Versul Yerros and Kassi Boyd, were
asked then to stand and speak of their qualifications. Versul,
who applied for the position of Chief Officer of Architecture
lost his bid by a narrow margin, while Miss Boyd was approved
for the seat of Mistress of Revels by a nearly unanimous vote,
with Ambassador Ayaliute being the only vote against.

After presentation of Badges of Office to both Dame Coelm and
Mistress Boyd, the new Lord General proclaimed
Rukshana Quari as the first of the Knight Justicars.
The floor was then opened to city business, and two goblins,
Sliktibbits Layheez and Lizzie Zchults brought charges against
Mistress Boyd about failure to honor a contract, and attacks
to their persons during the Talent Showdown a few days before.
Master Renomi promised to " dispatch the Justicars at first bells
the next morn to investigate this treasonous act" , after which
the Goblins were chased out of the council chamber when it was
mentioned by them that they had placed "harmful devizez aroun'
zee buildingz". Apparently the Goblins had feared their pleas would
fall on deaf ears, and had taken steps to insure their right to be heard.

Next on the docket was Captain Rinzai Vigo's petition to remove
"Torch Heads" , or Seraphim, from the city limits. The Captain
brought a petition signed by members of the UPL , or Urda
Protection League, whose signatures included: Rinzai Vigo, Elwin Good,
Rosh Ambo, Sliktibbits, Ilatopes Natzpanartby, Livia Cieleo,
Athindar Skadi, Vyn W., Rodrigo the Mesmerizer, Jinx Twotoes,
Rinaukas Sveltewood, Tavier Talareth, Aegys Redbow, 'The Calm
Monk', and Versius Ultum. After debate and reflection, Master
Renomi made the following statement:

"The… UPL, if I recall correctly, has their points duly noted. Until
such time as proof of Seraphim danger to the city, I do not believe
the Council shall take action upon it."

Captain Rinzai seemed most displeased, and it is suspected that
he will continue in his quest to see Seraphim banned from the city.
The next order of business was Avatar Delavan's request for the
taxation of the Temples to be removed in light of the appointment
of the new Lord General and the Knight Orders. This motion was
carried by the sitting members of the Council. Lawson Jones then
asked for information on joining the Order of the Demon Hunters,
and was told to post a note to Jager Banrognson in the Temple of
Aederon. Last to speak was the local entertainer Goro Dreadmouth,
who had this to say:

"eny actshuns taken gainst those two udder goblins shud nut reflect
on me or muh race as a whole. dems two act un dems own uh'kord.
I seed sevrul roun here inna room that uh thinked wood vouch for me.
I fear unjust punishment, rascizm, an percusions acuzz of dems
two idiots."

After hearing his plea, Master Renomi had this to say:
"The Council scribe shall make note of your desire, as I pray the
members of the citizenry present here do as well." The Meeting
was then adjourned and sitting members of the Council were
asked to stay behind. No word yet on the effects of the decisions
of the Council, or how local citizens feel about the appointments
that were made today, but as always readers are encouraged to
voice their thoughts or write a letter to the Evening Star
if they wish to remain anonymous , and their views will be
published.

Grand Opening & Trial news

The Theatre of Marr will be hosting it's Grand Opening
on the second day of the fifth month at nine bells in the evening,
and admission is Free to all citizens. The premiere performance
of "Tales of Old", a Psionic masterpiece of illusion, will be ushering
in what looks to be a promising season of excellence in the arts.

With Free admission, and the possibility of refreshments, citizens
of Urda would be foolish to miss this most amazing and illustrious
event, and it is hoped that the city will come out in force to
welcome the grand Theatre of Marr into the local social scene,
and show support for those artisans who go to so much trouble
to provide entertainment for the city.

In other news, the trial of Derigaaz the Duskwen, who is charged
with assault upon a Knight Justicar and possibly other crimes,
will be held soon in the Religious Council chambers in Urda.
No information is to be had at this time concerning what witnesses
will be called, or what defense the Duskwen will put forth.
Derigaaz is rumored to be a member of the infamous Travers
Scourge, and it is unclear whether his actions were directed
by another, or of his own personal volition, however the
successful prosecution of this individual may lead to further
trials and a possible end to the reign of terror that has plagued
Urda for several weeks.

Whatever the outcome, the Evening Star will be there to report
on the latest happenings in Urda and the surrounding lands, so
check your local herald for copies, and keep yourself informed!

Alley party & Adventure Guild fun

There was an impromptu alley party the other night
in the south end of Urda, with many revelers staying up
into the wee hours drinking and eating and generally
having a good time. Many of the party goers were members
of the Adventurer's Guild, and tales were told during the
party of forays to the old Mage tower in the northern swamps.
Apparently the shade of Dremsyl still haunts the place, and
the Guild braved many fell creations, including an animated
Brain of some sort, which they dispatched with skill and
courage.
As the city grows, be on the lookout for more of these back
alley get togethers, and don't be afraid to step up and introduce
yourself..who knows, you may just meet someone famous!

Tales of Old a Smashing Success!

The play "Tales of Old" opened to rave reviews today
at the Theatre of Marr in Urda, and citizens from all
over enjoyed free admission, glasses of champagne,
and hors'de'ovres , as well as one of the most exciting
and masterful displays of Psionic and Stage magick
ever seen. The Exalted Lilia shone bright as a star,
executing her masterpiece with verve and aplomb,
and the level of realism was unmatched by any play
seen before.
Aldo Penwinter and Wayvan Argent were on hand
to make the evening go as smoothly as possible, with
help from their assistant Fantus, and Wayvan's skills
were brightly showcased during the elegant and sometimes
frightening scenes.

The local Goblins showed up, and despite being given
reserved seating and special treatment still managed to
cause havoc and mayhem during the performance, but
in the spirit of true theatre , the show went on. Justicar
Rukshana and Primum were on guard this evening, and
were first on the scene when a local varanus citizen was
found murdered in the goblin seating area. They proceeded
to hunt for the elusive duo of Sliktibbits Layheez and Lizzie
Zchults, who ran amok and toilet papered the entire theatre,
then fled the scene.
A notice of Exile has been placed on the two after they attacked
the Knight Justicar while she was offering them the chance for
a trial, and all citizens are asked to be on the lookout for
the nefarious duo.

The following sketch shows a view of one of the scenes during
the performance…

[Marr Center Stage]
The lavishly painted auditorium ceiling is over three stories high in the back, 
and declines slowly towards the main stage, for excellent broadened acoustics.
 The high ceiling is supported by dark stained, highly polished curved wooden
 beams taken from the hulls of great ships. In front of the grand stage is a large 
seated pit, where the house musicians sit and accompany the main stage show.
 Flowing rippled crimson velvet curtains hang from the ceiling to the floor at the 
front of the stage, and are always closed, unless there is a performance.
 Various stage props such as painted trees, large house fronts, weapons,
 armor, monsters, costume carts, and other performing aids are scattered
 throughout the stage area in no discernible order. Along the outer walls of 
center stage are several rope and pulley racks and rods, which are used to
 control the massive curtains, or props hung from above.

Mucky Duck Adventuring Outfitters opens in Urda

The Mucky Duck is now open for business, and adventurers
throughout the island of Wingard have been flocking to the
new store. Clothing from sailor garb to mountaineering wear,
backpacks and satchels, sporrans and purses as well as many
instruments of unique design can be found at the shop.
The shop is staffed day and night, unlike Sadies, and looks
to be the go-to shop for all manner of folk.
The store is located just north of the Paper Crane.

The Evening Star would like to welcome the new shop to
Urda, and wish them prosperity in these troubled times.

Orphanage Peddle by Versul

Local merchant Versul Yerros held a charity auction
to benefit the orphans of Urda, and citizens turned out
in droves to support this noble venture. Over twenty one
thousand crowns were raised, and the proceeds of the
auction are slated to be used to build the Udra Orphanage.

Demon Sightings Continue

Soldier and lesser demons were sighted around Travers
and the surrounding area today, and citizens were up in arms
trying to stem the tide that threatens to sweep into the Isle
of Wingard through an as yet unknown opening. DemonHunter
Maltrinus Milforge was seen about , trying to make sense of
the chaos, and multiple groups of citizens banded together to
seek out and destroy the minions of the Void, who fell easily
to the experienced hands of the hunters.

Speculation runs wild as to the source of the demons, and what
the visions of the Psionic community might mean, but one thing
is clear, ..the seals made and renewed by the Demon Hunters are
not holding….unless these demons come from a different source,
in which case, Urda and Travers , and perhaps the whole Isle may
be in danger in a way never seen before…….

Stay close to the local couriers for the latest news and information
on these troubling matters.

Demons & Void Followers

Another wave of demon attacks hit southern Travers
today, with stronger demons and pit fiends coming
through an as yet unknown rift in the world. Many citizens
fell to the attacks, yet in the end the demons were pushed
back…for the time being. The cave south of Travers seems
to be a hotbed of demonic activity, and citizens are warned
to be wary when visiting this area. Justicars from Urda were
dispatched to investigate, but information seems to be
inconclusive, and further demonic attacks are expected.

In a possibly related event, followers of the Dark One were
seen at the site of the Sealing of the Rift, and citizens of Travers
and Urda quickly dispatched the pitifully weak group, though
it is unclear if the group accomplished anything with their
dark ministrations. The duskwen Mardek Thanes, along with
a human called Rane Valicet seemed to be in charge of the
madness, and ties to underground organizations are suspected.

All citizens of Travers and Urda are warned to be on their guard
and report any sightings of demons or Void followers to the
appropriate authorities.
