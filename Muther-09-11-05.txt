A grove of young, green-needled pine trees surrounds a small meadow of vibrantly flowering rhododendrons. Hues of bright pink, red, and white create a stunning contrast against the darker grey bark of the pines. Brighter green hemlock trees spread to catch the sunlight, which, in turn, shelter smaller stands of delicious salmonberry bushes, airy leather ferns, and poignantly fragranced sorrels that thrive on the compost of the forest floor. Soft haircap moss covers the river stone-lined path, dew from the mist collecting on it like pollen on bees. The distant wash of rushing water quietly filters through the peaceful air that hangs heavily saturated with moisture.  A grass filled shortcut, a stack of rocks, and a leafy branch are here.

Facing the beautiful forest of giant trees are several stately cottages, unique in the carving and design. The eaves are decorated with animal icons, masterfully carved from huge timbers, and the shake roofs are steep and overhanging. Exquisite craftsmanship prevails in the doorjambs, windowsills, and porch railings; each is a design of intricate carving that tells a story. The dwellings are far from gawdy, but instead simplistic in their communal design. A manicured lawn dotted with errant wildflowers fronts each cottage up to the edge of the river rock path.

Amidst the towering trees and verdant mid level bushes, several smaller cabins blend into the surrounding park. The peaked roofs of the cabins bear the familiar carving as seen on most of the village homes and their small porches sport plantings of flowering wild roses and perky daisies accented with the fronds of leather ferns and shelf fungus.  A closed chiseled petrified redwood door, a closed arched slate grey granite boulder door, a closed salt stained cargo hatch, a closed vine etched glass door, and a decaying pile of planks are here.

The chipped bark path widens to encompass a broad square between the peaked roofs of the village homes, the larger storefronts, and several communal buildings that all surround a magnificent fountain crafted from local sandstone. The multi-tiered fountain flows with pure, clean springwater and provides seating around its broad base.  The towering trees surround the village, enclosing the square in a living frame.  To the west is a sturdy building with its door perpetually ajar. A line of Leuian children trots off towards the north, bearing their lessons. The faint ding of nautical bells flows in on the breeze from the northwest.   A flowing gold-flecked sandstone fountain is here.

The chipped bark path widens to encompass a broad square between the peaked roofs of the village homes, the larger storefronts, and several communal buildings that all surround a magnificent fountain crafted from local sandstone. The multi-tiered fountain flows with pure, clean springwater and provides seating around its broad base.  The towering trees surround the village, enclosing the square in a living frame.  To the west is a sturdy building with its door perpetually ajar. A line of Leuian children trots off towards the north, bearing their lessons. The faint ding of nautical bells flows in on the breeze from the northwest.   A flowing gold-flecked sandstone fountain, some Leuian lobster lasagna, some Leuian lobster lasagna, some Leuian lobster lasagna, some Leuian lobster lasagna, and some Leuian lobster lasagna are here.

Tiruna says in Leuian, "I really don't think the staggering is all that necessary"

Crax blinks.

Tiruna says in Leuian, "many CM's will opt for renewing their committment"

Lthe nods to Tiruna.

The wide-eyed barn owl spreads its wings.

Tiruna says in Leuian, "I doubt all of them will decide to stop at the same time"

Kierra chuckles softly.

Lthe says to Tiruna in Leuian, "I suspect we'd find not all CM positions open at once anyway"

Tiruna says in Leuian, "so I don't foresee every CM deciding to step back at the same time as long as they know they aren't there till they drop from exhaustion"

Tiruna says in Leuian, "done"

Tiruna says in Leuian, "that those who have served as Active CM's and step down, hold a sort of honorific position"

Tiruna says in Leuian, "I remember this was brought up before , but at that time we were not amenable to it"

Tiruna says in Leuian, "I think its worth looking at again"

Crax ponders the meaning of the universe for a moment.

Shaleu raises an eyebrow.

An immense, smoothed river boulder deposited by the river, eons ago, is imbedded in the soft loam of the forest floor and blocks the view of the river to the north. A few giant trees have grown bent around its rounded shape and an innovative homeowner has taken advantage of the resulting shelter. Built carefully among the trees in the lee of the rock, stands a magnificent example of the same peaked wooden beam homes that dot the entire forest.
