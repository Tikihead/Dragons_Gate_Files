Dark antiqued woods panel the walls of this office, complete with a polished antique desk that measures the length of the room. A huge high-backed chair, padded in the softest burgundy leather commands from behind the desk. On the desk are neat stacks of papers along with an ink pot, feather quill and parchment. The official stamp of the barrister of Spur resides in a small walnut box, open at the moment and ready to be inked and put to purpose. Thick, luxurious velvet curtains swagged and tied off with richly twined gold tassels sweep across the beveled glass windows, dramatically puddling on the floor. Crystal hurricanes cover several wall sconces that give off a soft glow. Between the sconces is a small portrait of the barrister and his family, stiffly smiling for the artist.  A polished antique rosewood desk, a closed square walnut box, an open beautifully hand-carved walnut door, a copper token Hroomha, a copper token Hroomha, a copper token Hroomha, a copper token Hroomha, a copper token Hroomha, a copper Hroomha token, a copper Hroomha's token, and a copper Hroomra's token are here.

Many townsfolk pass along this busy thoroughfare. Rich and poor alike mix freely on this street, much to the dismay of a passing nobleman.

A beautiful fountain, sculpted from pristine white marble, rests at the center of Spur's main square. Clear, sparkling water sprays from a spout at the fountain's tip and cascades down several tiers before spilling into a circular pool. High above the square, the wings of two imperial stone dragons form an arch for a massive gateway. The colossal monument stands at the heart of the city like a silent sentinel keeping watch over the entire realm. Lifelike marble statues decorate the square's perimeter, each a celebrated hero of Spur's past.  A marble statue of a Human, some crystal flecked granite oliphant-shaped benches, a rosewood sign, a crisp gold lettered vellum notice, a flowing purple marble fountain, a shimmering purple marble statue of an Ice Demon, a small blackened pile of ashes, a short wooden stick, and an open tattered old book of notes are here.

Set in the marble base is a small plaque that reads, "For those who have gone before us." Many stand for a moment as they pass this way, giving thanks for the gift of life that is given by both the apple tree and the Secians of long ago. Large piles of dirt and broken stone lay on either side of the street as workmen ready the east and west alleys for expansion.

The entire avenue is composed of fine cobblestone, each level with its neighbor, providing a smooth ride for passing carriages and horses. The stones were customized by craftsmen, cut to order, rather than simply placed wherever they might fit. A few stately oaks and elms line the sides of the road, shading travelers during the daylight hours.  A street lantern is here.

Numerous trees lining the avenue serve as the dividing border between the majestic estates of the nobility and the lightly traveled roadway. The estates themselves are noticeably closer to the avenue than those to the south. However, they are no easier to access, still protected by their own guarding walls, some covered with ivy or colorful blooming vines.  A street lantern is here.

Occasional gates and driveways lead back into the well-kept estates of the city's nobility, breaking and adding interest to the defining plane of the walls lining Noble Way. The rest of the street seems to mimic the splendor of the estates beyond the wall. Swept and trimmed, the roadway exudes a simple, yet beautiful elegance.  A street lantern is here.

A small roadway bordered by flowering hedges bisects the wide avenue of Noble Way at a right angle, heading east to west.  A thick, sturdy sign stands just off to the side of a charming path, its large friendly letters intent on luring travelers into the city's premiere roadstay, the Gilded Lion Inn. The entrance is clearly marked and welcoming, extending off to the southeast.  A wooden sign and a street lantern are here.

Majestic elms continue to line this broad roadway, sheltering the avenue on both sides and further enhancing the grandiose atmosphere. Fronting the beautiful homes, cobbled paths edged with narrow flower beds meander through nearby private gardens. Though they appear wonderful places to spend an afternoon or take a picnic, the glances from those tending the estates makes it clear they are only for the invited.  A street lantern is here.

The occasional locked gate marks the entrance to some of the more hidden estates of Spurs nobility. From this broad avenue, little can be seen of their splendor. Behind the imposing gate recedes a proud drive, disappearing mysteriously into the trees. If not for the large imposing tower rising above the hedges it would be hard to discern anything was beyond the gate. It is apparent the residents do not wish to be disturbed.  A street lantern, a closed morbius door, and an open black iron gate are here.

[South Gate.]

A well-guarded gateway separates the city's residential district from the farmlands just beyond. Guards carefully eye all that enter or exit the city, beckoning gruffly to random travelers for a closer inspection. The structure of the guards' barracks is visible above the road to the west. A weathered wooden sign is posted by the gate.  An open iron gate, a wooden sign, a street lantern, and an open thick stone door are here.

Through the gate lies the city of Spur, the major center of trade and civilization on the plains. The dusty road leading through the gates is well traveled, and walls of the city are in good repair. A small shack sits to the west of the road, during most times of the day a dusty coach can be seen waiting in front, its horses stomping with impatience to be gone. To the right of the door is a small window, its opening covered with metal bars. An old man, missing most of his teeth, waits patiently for the travelers to pay their fare, and then directs them into the waiting area. On the east side of the road a billowing multicolored tent has been erected, the hustle and bustle of merchants and customers can be seen coming and going at all times of the day.  A rainbow silk tent and an open iron gate are here.

A broad strip of grassland that follows the main road east of you, this meadow is often used by the local aristocracy for picnicking and partying on good days. The city guardsmen keep the field clear of riffraff all year round, just to be safe.  A hole is here.

Set within a wide tunnel leading through the hedge to the north is the Wilderness Gate. It separates the settled lands of Spur from the open plains to the south of the city. The plains stretch as far as the eyes can see, the horizon and the walls of the fort down the road the only blemishes of the grassy landscape in the distance. The stones of the road are smoothly set together, well built to withstand heavy travel. A broken wagon wheel, discarded some time ago, covers a spot of nearby grass, weeds trying to climb through the spokes.  An open bronze gate is here.

The tradeway runs across the open grasslands northeast towards the Spur, and southwest towards distant lands and eventually, the coast. The plains to the south and east seem totally indifferent to your existence. Just ahead, a small path moves up a village of huts spread out in a semi-circle. In the center of the village a giant fire pit sits where barbarians who wander through the village can sit around to stay warm.  A worn grassy path is here.

It is here that those who wander the plains of the southlands gather together as something of a community. Barbarians from numerous clans come here to hone their skills and prove their honor in duels of battle. Entrances to all the huts seem to be closed except the largest hut in the middle of the semi-circle.  A worn grassy path and an open dried mud hut are here.
