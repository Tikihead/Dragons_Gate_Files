The hum of busy bees and hummingbirds add a tone of unity to the soft chants of the priests and murmurings of those here to offer up the sacrifices and tithes to the great Goddess, Elindale. Several monks wearing floor length robes sit in silence, with the occasional clasped hands rising up in a particularly vibrant part of prayer. The altar itself is composed of growing flowers, the tiny buds enclosing gems and gold alike. Around the base of the altar grows a ring of mushrooms, vibrantly cloaked in red with white spots dotting the umbrellas.

A large tapestry lines the outside wall of the passageway, most impressive in that it is not made of fabric, but of vines as tiny as thick hairs, growing in a weave. The delicate shadings of the plants is perfectly natural, and as the eye becomes unfocused, a picture of a diminutive, beautiful maiden sits amongst a foresty background. The wall opposite of this magnificent tapestry is lined with portraits of prominent temple leaders, the colors vibrant, bringing a life-like sense to the frames. The eyes of the maiden in the tapestry seem to follow you, staring directly as you pass, boring into your soul.  A vellum portrait, a canvas portrait, a suede portrait, some unfinished portraits, and a carefully painted silk screen are here.

A diminutive niche in the wall provides shelter to a small family of flying squirrels. Just inside sit the young, comfortably settled into the soft bedding the parents have gathered up. A breeze carries their tiny chitters to your ears, revealing that the niche is somehow connected to the outside world as well.  A niche in the wall is here.

This is the main entrance of a Temple of Elindale, the inside walls perfectly smooth with glowing magickal symbols upon the surfaces. The enormity of this tree becomes apparent as one travels up the stairs to the northwest. The air holds a fresh, new ambiance, pleasantly scented with sweet sap and rich, earthly undertones.  Some glowing magickal symbols and a brown oak staircase are here.

New wooden planks fit side by side creating the walkway that extends proudly upon the reconstructed supports. The view of the forest to the northwest is quite panoramic, despite the burnt spikes of trees in the midst. A staircase here seems to have some enchantment, judging by the strange appearance of unicorns, bears and owls on the lower steps. Strange, due to the fact that they don't appear carved, painted, or put there by any hand-made means. It is as if the glyphs grew into the wood itself. Mysterious symbols are scattered throughout the portraits, which shimmer with a golden whisper as they are approached.

A small wooden landing clings to the large tree trunk of the Northern Tree. A large wooden ramp leads down the main platform to the south. A short wooden railing surrounds all but one side of the platform. Vines and ropes provide access to more construction in the tree to the west.

Swollen beyond its banks, the once small creek is now a rushing overflowing river. What used to be the charred footbridge is now a safe haven for fish well down river, nothing left of its structure. Set well into the bank of the river is a long steel pole. Lashed to the pole is a heavy rope. The voice of the riverboat captain can be heard echoing across the water, taking command and moving his cargo.  A flowing river, a freshly painted sign, and some carved oak benches are here.

Lined with wooden seats, this slim oak boat looks to be able to carry its passengers relatively quickly to their destination. A sturdy rope is threaded through a steel eyelet that rises about two feet above the bow of the boat. The captain's muscles strain with each heave-ho on the rope, as the boat cleaves through the deep waters of the river.  An exit is here.
