Geriant says to Noemi, "they don't really dislike Sa or magick. The religion of Unknown tends to be somewhat undisciplined and more concerned with finding one's own answers. The study of magick tends to revolve around intensive study of other's works rather than one's own."

You have just entered an alternate reality where Dragon's Gate is just a game. "Characters", are left outside, so that the "Players" can discuss anything they wish, Out Of Character.  An open wooden door, an open black door, and some open giant white wooden double-doors are here.

This room is illuminated.
In the room are Brit the San Elf, Ronan the Hithual, Zydrigeon the Drake, Syntrik the Noble Psycian (lying down), Delior the Hithual, Vincentiv the San Elf, Equality the Secian, Rev the Noble Hithual (seated), Axe the Noble Hithual, Lady Gia the Elder (seated), Audun the Noble Leuian (seated), Tymas the Leuian (seated), Noemi the San Elf (seated), Banath the Hithual (seated), Teef the Noble Human (seated), Geriant the Noble Elder (seated), Kraggon the Noble Hithual (seated), Xaphania the San Elf (seated), Alwin the Secian (seated), and Ward the Leuian.
Obvious exits: north* northeast* east* southeast* south*.

Rev says, "they dont"

Ronan says to Banath, "don't make me drag you outside"

Ronan mumbles something beneath his breath.

Teef says, "and no one trusts leuians"

Audun murmurs didgeridoo.

Teef says to Zydrigeon, "go back to where you came from"

Zydrigeon says, "so, the most populated area of the game world, (read that ONLY populated area)  and the guys upstairs gave no info on how it came to be."

Geriant says, "Not really, no. Aboriginal cultures just mean the first cultures in an area more or less. Humans were the first race in the lands, over time the others appeared.. where they came from isn't known."

Zydrigeon says, "okay, thanks."

Ward says to Zydrigeon, "no way man. Leuia is twice the size of Spur. ive seen it"

Ward nods firmly.

Tymas says to Ward, "the spur is a town"

Geriant says, "Ok, Ward is up next I'm told."

Zydrigeon says to Ward, "shake out your pipe man, your getting the ashes again."

Geriant says to Zydrigeon, "Probably down to stems and seeds. Those setites are always hard up."

Tymas whispers, "hehe!"

Zydrigeon snickers.

Equality ponders loading another bowl.

Zydrigeon says to Axe, "no, he's just refusing to sleep."

Tymas says to Axe, "no, i did some smack about an hour ago"

Axe nods.
' anyone ever tried the brown duxa?

Glinka asks, " anyone ever tried the brown duxa?"

Axe says, "AH..that'd explain it"

You duck.

Geriant says, "Not a lot to say, Reason was pretty good at public relations and spin. Set is a god of deception among other things.. while there are some sects that are socialist in nature there are others that are supremely capitalistic."

Ward asks Geriant, "So before Reason Set was just a bunch of thieves doing their normal thing?"

Zydrigeon asks Ward, "were you around when Panterra and Orchist ran the thieves?"

Zydrigeon asks, "long ago?"

Teef mutters bah i'd rather have my xanax and oxy's.

Ward shakes his head from side to side.

Tymas asks Zydrigeon, "Phantarra?"

Zydrigeon says, "was amazing."
' was fun

Glinka says, " was fun"

Zydrigeon says to Tymas, "bah, never good with names"

Ward says, "Orchist has told me alot about it but its mostly just the bragging stories"

Tymas says, "hehe"

Xaphania nods to Ward.

Tymas says, "Panterra bread"

Audun chuckles softly.

Xaphania says to Ward, "Heard those too."

Zydrigeon says to Ward, "a lot of it wasnt bragging.  they were quite well done."

Ward says, "like stealing 1 million gold or something"

Geriant says, "There weren't many followers of Set outside of thieves at the time, a few clerics here and there like Slide but the religion was mostly thieves early on AOL."

Audun says, "Well, that was Alsan."

You bow her head in memory of Slide.

Ward asks Geriant, "One other thing. The story about Set being ran out of Spur then flooding the town with serpents. why were they ran out?"

Audun asks, "Need you ask?"

Audun murmurs something beneath his breath.

Zydrigeon says, "that was Oda trying to act macho i think."

Teef says, "leuian propaganda"

Geriant says, "Probably better off finding stories in the old DFC's than relying on my memory for pre-Reason times in the temple."

Geriant says, "They were run out because thieves were stealing everything."

Audun says, "There really weren't any Setite clerics of note before Reason."

Gia grins.

Ward says, "I figured. I just was curious if it was anything other then that"

Teef says, "not anymore"

Gia says, "all right ... next up"

Gia says, "Axe"

[OOC Inn.]

You have just entered an alternate reality where Dragon's Gate is just a game. "Characters", are left outside, so that the "Players" can discuss anything they wish, Out Of Character.  An open wooden door, an open black door, and some open giant white wooden double-doors are here.

This room is illuminated.
In the room are Brit the San Elf, Zydrigeon the Drake, Delior the Hithual, Vincentiv the San Elf, Equality the Secian, Rev the Noble Hithual (seated), Axe the Noble Hithual, Lady Gia the Elder (seated), Audun the Noble Leuian (seated), Tymas the Leuian (seated), Banath the Hithual (seated), Slade the Psycian, Teef the Noble Human (seated), Geriant the Noble Elder (seated), Xaphania the San Elf (seated), Alwin the Secian (seated), and Ward the Leuian.

Axe says to Geriant, "I wanted to ask why hithuals were magick resistant"

Axe says, "There are a couple different things I read"

Teef says to Geriant, "well if they would just pay the protection money like they're suppposed too"

Axe says, "And I guess it might have to do with history"

Tymas says to Axe, "beacuse giving them _10 damage mod isnt enough"

Tymas says, "+"

Banath asks Tymas, "Would you like my magick mod instead?"

Axe asks Geriant, "Is it from not believing in magick, or from living near something?"

Tymas says to Banath, "i use magick alot"

(Tymas appear mood sarcastic)

Rev just removed a large green diamond from within his giant black silk top hat.

Banath says to Axe, "Let him answer, don't give him ideas"

You chuckle to Rev.
>
Geriant says, "It's part of their nature, partially from their stubborn way of thinking that magick is just trickery. They are so willful, they refuse to let it affect them."

Equality's stomach growls.

Inside the open large forest green leather backpack you see a dark shadowy orb of Set, a worn tattered scale, a rainbow colored silk cap, a pair of steel tipped leather boots, a pearl imbedded silver brazier, a closed jar of tribal paint, a glass of fruit juice, a glass of elven wine, a bottle of Saldean rum, a beautiful red long-stemmed rose, a pale green hemp belt, a simple wooden alms bowl, and a closed forest green Elindalian book of prayers.

An abundant gallery of paintings depicting sacrifices and hold offerings to their god suspend from crooked iron nails. Resting beside each painting, cold black iron braziers appear to hold burned blood and bone. A few charred, blackened pieces can be found in them. Several iron chains hang along the walls of the sacrificial chamber. Along the floor, intricately placed colored slate tiles are coated in dust covered dried blood. Centering the room is a raised platform accessible through a flight of stairs. Upon this raised formation rests an altar inlaid with rows and rows of teeth.

Illuminated obsidian gems embedded into the thick, black stone walls cast a cold, dim light over the room. Along the coffered ceiling is a fading mural of several robed priests during a sacrifice. The gloomy picture shows the priests positioned around a terrified human kneeling before a huge many-fanged maw. Bright crimson blood flows from a wound in the human's neck, inflicted by a wicked-looking obsidian garrote held by one hooded priest. Deep crimson light wells up from between the priest's fingers, seeming to emanate from the garrote. Covering most of the eastern wall, large amounts of melted wax from red candles have oozed over the mantel of a large tudor fireplace and slithered down the legs of its stone surface. Resting in the center of the room presides a dusty granite round table encircled by intricately carved crafted high back chairs.  A dusty round granite table and a large stone fireplace are here.

An abundant gallery of paintings depicting sacrifices and hold offerings to their god suspend from crooked iron nails. Resting beside each painting, cold black iron braziers appear to hold burned blood and bone. A few charred, blackened pieces can be found in them. Several iron chains hang along the walls of the sacrificial chamber. Along the floor, intricately placed colored slate tiles are coated in dust covered dried blood. Centering the room is a raised platform accessible through a flight of stairs. Upon this raised formation rests an altar inlaid with rows and rows of teeth.   A stone slab, a cold black iron brazier, an intricately carved many-fanged maw statue, and a massive blood-stained stone altar are here.

This room is illuminated.
In the room are Axe the Noble Hithual, Tymas the Leuian, Geriant the Noble Elder, and Alwin the Secian (holding a glowing lantern).

The air in this underground chamber is thick with dust and the stale dankness of centuries gone by. A soft layer of red dirt covers the rocky floor, swirling at random intervals as the wind from the mesa sweeps through the cavern. A narrow tunnel opens up at the northern end, its entrance laden with unfamiliar runes. A square portion of the clay ground is strangely elevated near the eastern wall.  An archaic rune-etched tunnel entrance and a crumbling clay slab are here.

                                    Visualization #1 is:
Swollen beyond its banks, the once small creek is now a rushing overflowing river. What used to be the charred footbridge is now a safe haven for fish well down river, nothing left of its structure. Set well into the bank of the river is a long steel pole. Lashed to the pole is a heavy rope. The voice of the riverboat captain can be heard echoing across the water, taking command and moving his cargo.

                                    Visualization #2 is:
Four sturdy walls and a roof of woven branches enclose this small tavern. From the forest floor, winding their way around the trunk of the Mother Tree, a set of intricately railed steps serve as the entrance and exit of the town of Treehaven. Strangers arriving at the top of the steps find themselves under the watchful eye of patrons seated at tables positioned about the light, airy room. A set of oak steps lead up to the new Council chambers.

                                    Visualization #3 is:
An abundant gallery of paintings depicting sacrifices and hold offerings to their god suspend from crooked iron nails. Resting beside each painting, cold black iron braziers appear to hold burned blood and bone. A few charred, blackened pieces can be found in them.

A dizzying array of unfamiliar runes cover the wall opposite the tunnel, and they seem to shift and swirl when not directly looked at. Upon the eastern and western walls, elaborately sinister murals depict several individuals in various stages of a ceremonial feast. Exaggerated smiles with sharpened teeth decorate each character's face as they open wide, depositing whole, flesh-covered bones inside their respective chasms. In the largest mural, a dark figure with the pointed ears of a bat sits at the head of the bone-legged table, waiting.  A bone carved clay topped table, some skin wrapped bone eating utensils, and a tunnel are here.

A circular barrier of different sized skulls stands undisturbed around a small, strange statue of black clay. Embedded rubies serve as the eyes of the fiendish figure, which resembles a wingless bat in humanoid form. Its clawed hand is outstretched, presenting a goblet fashioned out of a skull to any who choose to let their gaze linger. A strange bone handle juts out on the southern wall.

Blackened bone sconces, long snuffed out, have been placed in several spots upon the dusty cavern walls. A circular barrier of different sized skulls stands undisturbed around a small, strange statue of black clay. Embedded rubies serve as the eyes of the fiendish figure, which resembles a wingless bat in humanoid form. Its clawed hand is outstretched, presenting a goblet fashioned out of a skull to any who choose to let their gaze linger. A strange bone handle juts out on the southern wall.

A dizzying array of unfamiliar runes cover the wall opposite the tunnel, and they seem to shift and swirl when not directly looked at. Upon the eastern and western walls, elaborately sinister murals depict several individuals in various stages of a ceremonial feast. Exaggerated smiles with sharpened teeth decorate each character's face as they open wide, depositing whole, flesh-covered bones inside their respective chasms. In the largest mural, a dark figure with the pointed ears of a bat sits at the head of the bone-legged table, waiting.  A bone carved clay topped table, some skin wrapped bone eating utensils, and a tunnel are here.

[Under the Temple Ruins.]

Within the walls of this dark cavern, sounds echo chaotically; sometimes threefold, sometimes not at all. Two sets of long iron rails - one near the low ceiling and one near the floor - run along opposite walls. Evenly spaced, long chains extend from the rails, some of which lie slackened inside piles of skeletal remains. Though the air has long lost its stench of rot and decay, evidence of grueling struggle is all around: in frantic, shallow diggings in the ground, on the walls, in the ceiling.  Some yellowing skeletal remains and a long braided ladder of hair are here.

The air in this underground chamber is thick with dust and the stale dankness of centuries gone by. A soft layer of red dirt covers the rocky floor, swirling at random intervals as the wind from the mesa sweeps through the cavern. A narrow tunnel opens up at the northern end, its entrance laden with unfamiliar runes. A square portion of the clay ground is strangely elevated near the eastern wall.  A square clay trapdoor, an archaic rune-etched tunnel entrance, and a crumbling clay slab are here.

The outward appearance of the people here seems a bit classier. Rich clothing and large coin purses are prevalent amongst the travelers. In fact, many of the folk heading into Town Square from the south are accompanied by large bodyguards to assure their safety. The well maintained road is lined with small brass lanterns, each swinging off an individual pole. No expense has been spared to keep those who travel this road safe from the hoodlums that relish the darkness.  A street lantern is here.

Vast estates tower over the huge Spurian wall towards the south. The well-to-do who live in these homes idle away their days, enjoying the luxury of time. Standing next to a very empty lantern pole, a small Flerian child insists in a plaintive wail, that he had nothing to do with the missing lantern. The well-dressed guard that interrogates him keeps pointing at a small sack on the ground and its obvious contents.  An open small burlap sack and a street lantern are here.

Atop the fountain is an intricately carved Secian who appears to be dancing with the water as it splashes around her. Set in the marble base is a small plaque that reads, "For those who have gone before us." Many stand for a moment as they pass this way, giving thanks for the gift of life that is given by both the apple tree and the Secians of long ago. Large piles of dirt and broken stone lay on either side of the street as workmen ready the east and west alleys for expansion.  A street lantern is here.

The occasional locked gate marks the entrance to some of the more hidden estates of Spurs nobility. From this broad avenue, little can be seen of their splendor. Behind the imposing gate recedes a proud drive, disappearing mysteriously into the trees. If not for the large imposing tower rising above the hedges it would be hard to discern anything was beyond the gate. It is apparent the residents do not wish to be disturbed.  A street lantern, a closed morbius door, and an open black iron gate are here.

[South Gate.]

A well-guarded gateway separates the city's residential district from the farmlands just beyond. Guards carefully eye all that enter or exit the city, beckoning gruffly to random travelers for a closer inspection. The structure of the guards' barracks is visible above the road to the west. A weathered wooden sign is posted by the gate.  An open stone gate, a wooden sign, a closed thick stone door, and a street lantern are here.

Set within a wide tunnel leading through the hedge to the north is the Wilderness Gate. It separates the settled lands of Spur from the open plains to the south of the city. The plains stretch as far as the eyes can see, the horizon and the walls of the fort down the road the only blemishes of the grassy landscape in the distance. The stones of the road are smoothly set together, well built to withstand heavy travel. A broken wagon wheel, discarded some time ago, covers a spot of nearby grass, weeds trying to climb through the spokes.

Blackened bone sconces, long snuffed out, have been placed in several spots upon the dusty cavern walls. A circular barrier of different sized skulls stands undisturbed around a small, strange statue of black clay. Embedded rubies serve as the eyes of the fiendish figure, which resembles a wingless bat in humanoid form. Its clawed hand is outstretched, presenting a goblet fashioned out of a skull to any who choose to let their gaze linger. A strange bone handle juts out on the southern wall.  A ruby-eyed blackened clay statue and an open bone handled clay door are here.

A dizzying array of unfamiliar runes cover the wall opposite the tunnel, and they seem to shift and swirl when not directly looked at. Upon the eastern and western walls, elaborately sinister murals depict several individuals in various stages of a ceremonial feast. Exaggerated smiles with sharpened teeth decorate each character's face as they open wide, depositing whole, flesh-covered bones inside their respective chasms. In the largest mural, a dark figure with the pointed ears of a bat sits at the head of the bone-legged table, waiting.  A bone carved clay topped table, some skin wrapped bone eating utensils, and a tunnel are here.

[Wilderness gate.]

Set within a wide tunnel leading through the hedge to the north is the Wilderness Gate. It separates the settled lands of Spur from the open plains to the south of the city. The plains stretch as far as the eyes can see, the horizon and the walls of the fort down the road the only blemishes of the grassy landscape in the distance. The stones of the road are smoothly set together, well built to withstand heavy travel. A broken wagon wheel, discarded some time ago, covers a spot of nearby grass, weeds trying to climb through the spokes.

Through the gate lies the city of Spur, the major center of trade and civilization on the plains. The dusty road leading through the gates is well traveled, and walls of the city are in good repair. A small shack sits to the west of the road, during most times of the day a dusty coach can be seen waiting in front, its horses stomping with impatience to be gone. To the right of the door is a small window, its opening covered with metal bars. An old man, missing most of his teeth, waits patiently for the travelers to pay their fare, and then directs them into the waiting area. On the east side of the road a billowing multicolored tent has been erected, the hustle and bustle of merchants and customers can be seen coming and going at all times of the day.  A rainbow silk tent and an open iron gate are here.

A well-guarded gateway separates the city's residential district from the farmlands just beyond. Guards carefully eye all that enter or exit the city, beckoning gruffly to random travelers for a closer inspection. The structure of the guards' barracks is visible above the road to the west. A weathered wooden sign is posted by the gate.  An open stone gate, a wooden sign, a closed thick stone door, and a street lantern are here.

The occasional locked gate marks the entrance to some of the more hidden estates of Spurs nobility. From this broad avenue, little can be seen of their splendor. Behind the imposing gate recedes a proud drive, disappearing mysteriously into the trees. If not for the large imposing tower rising above the hedges it would be hard to discern anything was beyond the gate. It is apparent the residents do not wish to be disturbed.  A street lantern, a closed morbius door, and an open black iron gate are here.

Atop the fountain is an intricately carved Secian who appears to be dancing with the water as it splashes around her. Set in the marble base is a small plaque that reads, "For those who have gone before us." Many stand for a moment as they pass this way, giving thanks for the gift of life that is given by both the apple tree and the Secians of long ago.

In fact, many of the folk heading into Town Square from the south are accompanied by large bodyguards to assure their safety. The well maintained road is lined with small brass lanterns, each swinging off an individual pole. No expense has been spared to keep those who travel this road safe from the hoodlums that relish the darkness.  A street lantern is here.

[Town Square East.]

Travel to the eastern portion of Town Square finds battle clad warriors shoulder to shoulder with chained criminals and those who live outside the Spurian Walls. The cobblestones that line the street are stained with blood.  It is unknown as to whether the blood is from guards carrying out quick executions, or gladiators who refused to wait their turn for arena space.  A street lantern is here.

People hurry on their way along the eastern road both into and out of Spur. A black clad woman holding the hands of two small children slowly walks towards the east, facing the somber task of burial. Two armored warriors, carrying tankards, are in high spirits as they head back to Town Square to share the story of their day in the arena.  A street lantern is here.

[Condemned Walk.]

A small rivulet of blood flows down the path that leads from the north and meets up with Condemned Walk. At the end of the path lies Execution Square and its viewing stands. It is at this point that the sentenced criminals discover their fate. Many hope to battle for their lives in the arena, but for most, the sentence is execution by one of the Spurian Justices.  A street lantern is here.

Those who use Condemned Walk as a thoroughfare find themselves amongst an interesting group of travelers. Those returning from burying their dead and those from the dilapidated housing beyond the eastern gate mix with warriors and criminals. There has been many a time when a poor man has been mistaken for a common criminal and sent to battle those in the arena.  A street lantern is here.

A colorfully clad flerian calls out the odds on newly sentenced criminals as they are marched slowly by heading towards their fate in the arena. For some the chance to fight will mean they live, for others the arena can be a cruel and painful death. One must wonder if many who are led to the arena would have preferred a simple execution.  A street lantern is here.

A diverse group of people travel through this large iron gateway. Gladiators lead criminals towards the arena. It is readily apparent that only the gladiators return, usually with a satisfied smirk on their faces. A large group of guards on top of the large Spurian Wall keeps a careful watch on the downtrodden who travel this way. Their appearance makes them suspect, their lack of strength, natural victims.  An open iron gate and a street lantern are here.

Dejected gladiators sit in front of the arch banging their sword hilts on the gate. Carts carrying bodies for the cemetery roll past the arch, those pushing the carts shaking their heads in awe at the sight.  An open iron gate is here.

A large double gate opens on the south side of the road, leading down an old cobbled path. Large wagons, small ox carts, and in some cases old buckboards make the turn toward the cemetery carrying their precious cargo to its final resting place. A large group of darkly-clad San Elves stand just outside the gate, carefully perusing those who pass by. It becomes obvious that those in Taath's Temple will be quickly informed of any insurgent groups heading their direction.  A large double gate is here.

The crowd travels in both directions, moving with definite purpose. Downtrodden and of modest means, most wear the tattered clothing of the poor. Whether pushing carts of homegrown fruits and vegetables towards market or carefully holding the hands of dirt-smudged children and heading towards the housing to the east, talk is kept to a minimum, and eye contact is not made.

A large, stubborn dog has resolutely planted himself in the middle of the road. His master pulls on the rope around his neck, then pushes his backside firmly. It is quite apparent that nothing short of a nice meaty bone is going to make him budge. Those who travel this path keep their heads lowered and ignore the comical scene. A gnawing hunger and aching muscles after a long day of hard work keep most from paying attention to even the simple things around them.

A small gate stands between Eastern Spur Road and the small, weed infested path that heads north. Through the rusted and worn gate you can make out a few old headstones and crypts, but the vines and overgrown brush obstruct your view. The rumors of evil death-howls and unusual occurrences have the locals hurrying past this location as quickly as possible.  An open black obsidian gate is here.

Quickly whispered words and furtive gestures at the edifice seem enough to straighten out even the most unruly child. A distinctive howl pierces the air. Not many stop long enough to discern if it is just the wind or something far more sinister.

Although everything else has fallen into disrepair, it is evident that security is still of foremost importance to the Governor. Uniformed guards patrol high above, conscientiously glancing down to assure peace is being kept along this well-traveled road. A crotchety old man leans against the wall, just out of view of the guards, counting the coin he has thus far appropriated this fine day.  An open iron gate and an open thick stone door are here.

They lumber to their feet and start heading your way, but halfway to you they start fighting with each other. You decide this is a good moment to move along quickly.

Pushing a few bushes aside, you spot a hidden trail that leads off over a gently sloping hill not too far away. Although hidden, it appears this dirt trail is well used and in excellent condition. The bushes and flowers that line the path are not wild and look like they've been carefully tended.   A pathway leading out is here.

If only you knew whose symbol that is.

The small dirt trail turns to the north and closes in on the large keep that lies just beyond a hill. The keep appears to be made out of gray granite and has two tall round towers on each side of the front facing wall. A towering wall made of the same stone as the keep itself surrounds the impressive manor home.

A soft blue velvet carpet covers the cold white marble floor.  An open exquisitely carved mahogany door and a carved mahogany banister are here.

[Valeria's Keep, Guest Suite]

Pure opulence greets the eye in this guest suite. A warm fire glows in the fireplace on one side of the room, and a velvet canopied bed rests against the wall on the other side. Deep forest green hues dominate the linen in the room, and polished oak panels cover the walls. Soft pillows are piled high on the bed, the coverlet turned down, inviting you to rest.   An open exquisitely carved mahogany door and a colorful stained glass window are here.

Rolling hills of green stretch as far as the eye can see, and not too far from the keep there is a beautiful blue lake with tall oak trees gathered around it.  Just barely visible from the window, a pair of graceful white swans swim in circles around the center of the tiny lake.

You know from the meal that waits prepared downstairs that this home is occupied, but the place is eerily silent.

[Valeria's Keep, Master Bedroom]

To say this round tower room is furnished lavishly would be an understatement. Deep mahogany wood was used for the walls and floor, polished to a dark gleam. Heavy deep blue velvet drapes hang on the large glass window in the outer wall. A large fire burns in the fireplace on one side of the room, while a canopy bed takes up most of the other side. White silk sheets and a dark blue spread cover the inviting feather bed and pillows.   An open gold-trimmed mahogany door, a soft blue velvet draped canopy bed, a mahogany nightstand, and a colorful stained glass window are here.

A small, satin covered love seat sits in the corner created by a bend in the hallway, the perfect spot for two people to sit and talk.

Pastel colored drawings of various creatures both real and imaginary cover the walls.  Friendly looking animals of every kind frolic around on a pastel blue background. Two small beds sit on either end of the room, one pink and one blue. Toys lay scattered about on the floor of the room and piled high on shelves.   An open gold-trimmed mahogany door, a colorful stained glass window, some colorful toys, a soft pink bed, a soft blue bed, and a swirling red portal are here.

You're on a very small ledge from which tiny rocks crumble and fall thousands of feet into the gorge below you. As you gaze around you are struck by visions of snow-capped mountain peaks and low hanging clouds which encircle you. Winding around this peak is a narrow ledge, the only viable path other than a suicidal plunge.   A swirling red portal is here.

Above you, the sword-wielding dragon battles a demonic figure cloaked in flames as they fly above the battle that rages around you. Six beings in fantastic suits of armor stand against a dark tide of nightmarish creatures, their armor and weapons glowing with arcane power.
